This is a step by step guide to reproduce the results in "Open science and communal culture promote women's participation, diversity and discovery". 

The overall work flow can be captured by the following DAG:

In this demo, you will be able to:

1. [Rerun the entire workflow using Snakemake](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/ReproducibilityDemo/wiki/Rerun-the-workflow-with-Snakemake) and reproduce all output files and figures including the DAG shown above.
2. Follow our [data cleaning and transformation steps and generate network visualizations](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/ReproducibilityDemo/wiki/Data-cleaning,-transformation-&-network-visualizations) that is identical to Figure 1 (dataIngestion+dataTransformation+visualize). 
3. [Conduct gender analysis based on author names](https://github.com/iuni-cadre/ReproducibilityDemo/wiki/Gender-analysis-based-on-author-names) and reproduce Figure 2 and 3 (genderDetect+ to be updated).
4. Follow our text analyses of the abstracts and reproduce Figure 4 (to be updated).
