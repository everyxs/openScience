But the estimated average replicability rate of key-effects that top-tier psychology journals report falls between 36% and 39% (objective vs. subjective rate; Open Science Collaboration (2015)). So the standard mode of applying null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) fails to adequately separate stable from random effects. Therefore, NHST does not fully convince as a statistical inference strategy. We argue that the replicability crisis is “home-made” because more sophisticated strategies can deliver results the successful replication of which is sufficiently probable. Thus, we can overcome the replicability crisis by integrating empirical results into genuine research programs. Instead of continuing to narrowly evaluate only the stability of data against random fluctuations (discovery context), such programs evaluate rival hypotheses against stable data (justification context).",2051088967; 1957352506,Erich H.

This panel will address innovations that promote transparency and accelerate the pace of research, such as post-publication review, open peer review, and research evaluation ethics, exploring questions such as: • Who qualifies as a peer reviewer? • What kinds of content should be reviewed? Datasets? Editorials? • What are the strengths and weaknesses of pre-publication vs. post-publication peer review? • Is open peer review integrated with the formal publication process? Does it need to be? • What concerns are there with making peer review open? Are there benefits to anonymity, for example? • How do we ensure productive and civil discourse in a public review process? • How do these innovations change the relationship between the reviewer and the author? • Is it important to address the novelty and significance of the research in the review, or should it be only about content and soundness? • What is the anticipated trajectory of these changes in peer review and how might they affect research 25 years from now? This presentation was given during Open Access Week 2015, jointly sponsored by the Carnegie Mellon University Libraries and the University Library System, University of Pittsburgh on Monday, October 19, from 4:30 - 6:00pm at the University Club, University of Pittsburgh.

The PuNDIT Team is working closely with the perfSONAR developers from ESnet and Internet2 to integrate PuNDIT components as part of the perfSONAR Toolkit. A primary goal for PuNDIT is to convert complex network metrics into easily understood diagnoses in an automated way.

Access to information and disclosure of research results are key to the advancement of a knowledge economy. Current academic knowledge development, however, is characterized by two tendencies which may form a threat to further knowledge creation: increasing privatisation of knowledge, on the one hand, and growing expansion of intellectual property protection regimes, on the other hand. The present paper explores both tendencies, and reflects on the status of academic knowledge and the role of university patents in this delicate debate.We kick off by elucidating and explaining some frequently used concepts (part 2). Then we will focus on the question whether knowledge emanating from universities can be privatized by way of patents, i.e. we will be looking at the legitimacy and acceptability of present appropriation practices (part 3). As the trend towards privatization at universities seems to be unstoppable, we will not dwell long on this question but move on to two moot points: (a) what is the impact on the public domain of the increased privatization of knowledge emanating from universities, and (b) how can universities uphold the public domain and how can they promote open access in a context of growing privatization?Despite our being engrossed - albeit only for a short while - in the problematic issues related to the acquiring of patents by universities ('the existence of patents' - part 4), we will mainly focus on the problems arising out of the use of patent rights ('the exercise of patent rights' - part 5). This focus derives from the fact that although the Flemish legislator encourages patents in many ways, there are relatively few standards and criteria as to how those rights, once acquired, can and should be exercised. So, there is an enormous field of unexplored territory for policymaking to give shape to fair, reasonable and ethical patent behavior.",184063835,Geertrui Van Overwalle

In higher education the transition from distance learning to on-line learning has started. For on-line learning in higher education, w ebinars are becoming an indispensable tool. However, educators’ opinion on webinars in higher education has not been analyzed. The aim of the present contribution is to analyze educators‘ opinion on webinars in higher education underpinning elaboration of a hypothesis on use of webinars in on-line educational environment within higher education. The meaning of such key concepts as webinar, opinion, on-line learning and on-line educational environment is studied. Moreover, the study shows how the steps of the process are related: identifying webinars → defining educators’ opinion → empirical study → conclusions. The empirical study was carried out in September 2015. The sample included 58 educators from the teacher training institution, namely Dr. Sivanthi Aditanar College of Education in India. The study results demonstrate that the educators’ opinions on webinars in higher education are homogeneous . A hypothesis on use of webinars in on-line educational environment within higher education is elaborated.

Most of the existing service discovery approaches focus on finding candidate services based on functional and non-functional requirements as well as historical usage analysis. Complementary to the existing methods, this paper proposes to leverage human trust to facilitate software service selection and recommendation. A trust model is presented that leverages the implicit human factor to help quantify the trustworthiness of candidate services. A hierarchical Knowledge-Social-Trust KST network model is established to extract hidden knowledge from various publication repositories e.g., DBLP and social networks e.g., Twitter and DBLP. As a proof of concept, a prototyping service has been developed to help scientists evaluate and visualize trust of services.

Drawing on a survey of 1,400 life scientists about to enter the job market, we suggest an alternative view. First, we show significant heterogeneity in the price scientists assign to the opportunity to publish in firms, and those scientists who seek industry careers have particularly low preferences for publishing. Thus, many job applicants are not willing to accept lower wages for jobs that let them publish and firms pursuing open science strategies may instead have to pay publishing incentives that fulfill both sorting and incentive functions. Second, we show that scientists with higher ability have a higher price of publishing but also expect to be paid higher wages regardless of the publishing regime. Thus, they are not cheaper to hire than other scientists if allowed to publish, but they are more expensive if publishing is restricted. Finally, we show that scientists publish not simply for “peer recognition” but also for more specific reasons, including the opportunity to advance science or to move to higher-paying jobs. Different reasons predict what price a scientist assigns to the opportunity to publish and may also have very different implications for the sustainability of competitive advantages derived from open science strategies.",1968859041; 2168976755,Henry Sauermann; Michael Roach

Yet, relatively little is known about desirable organizing processes in virtual open science communities. To this end, a simulation-based exploratory study is conducted to better understand the conditions that confer increased rates of innovation in such socio-technical systems. Three types of open science communities are identified and simulated using agent simulation as a method of inquiry. Simulation results show that centrality, as a measure of degree of connectedness, correlates with innovation output in exploratory and service communities up to a point. Also, utility-oriented communities have social network structures with low density and high centrality, which suggest high potential for innovation.",2160511730; 1660732377,Guangyu Zou; Levent Yilmaz

In recent years, there is renewed enthusiasm about the prospect of achieving clinically useful tools capable of aiding the diagnosis and management of neuropsychiatric disorders. The present work explores the basis for this enthusiasm. We assert that there is no single advance that currently has the potential to drive the field of clinical brain imaging forward. Instead, there has been a constellation of advances that, if combined, could lead to the identification of objective brain imaging-based markers of illness. In particular, we focus on advances that are helping to (1) elucidate the research agenda for biological psychiatry (e.g., neuroscience focus, precision medicine), (2) shift research models for clinical brain imaging (e.g., big data exploration, standardization), (3) break down research silos (e.g., open science, calls for reproducibility and transparency), and (4) improve imaging technologies and methods. Although an arduous road remains ahead, these advances are repositioning the brain imaging community for long-term success.",1936410844; 2051689781; 2096987888,Michael P. Milham; R.

1.There is a high demand for biodiversity observation data to inform conservation and environmental policy, and citizen scientists generate the vast majority of terrestrial biodiversity observations. As this work is voluntary, many people assume that these data are openly available for use in conservation and scientific research.

2.Here, the openness of biodiversity observation data that are contributed to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility is examined by the data provider. Contrary to what many people assume, datasets from volunteers are among the most restrictive in how they can be used.

3.Policy implications. The assumption that voluntary data collection leads to data sharing does not recognize the wishes and motivations of those who collect data, nor does it respect the crucial contributions of these data to long-term monitoring of biodiversity trends. To improve data openness, citizen scientists should be recognised in ways that correspond with their motivations. Furthermore, organisations that manage these data should make their data sharing policies open and explicit.

Instead of submitting jobs through a dedicated gatekeeper, as most remote submission mechanisms use, it uses the built-in SSH protocol to gain access to the cluster. By using a common access method, SSH, we are able to simplify the interaction with the cluster, making the submission process more user friendly. Additionally, it does not add any extra software to be installed on the cluster making Bosco an attractive option for the cluster administrator. In this paper, we will describe Bosco, the personal supercomputing assistant, and how Bosco is used by researchers across the U.S. to manage their computing workflows. In addition, we will also talk about how researchers are using it, including an unique use of Bosco to submit CMS reconstruction jobs to an opportunistic XSEDE resource.",2144263850; 2714839988; 1989818769; 2171352995; 2691435011; 2278219369; 1986021554,Derek Weitzel; I.

In recent years, several extensions to STROBE have been created to provide more nuanced field-specific guidance for authors. The content and the prevalence of extension endorsement have not yet been assessed. Accordingly, there are two aims: (1) to classify changes made in the extensions to identify strengths and weaknesses of the original STROBE checklist and (2) to determine the prevalence and typology of endorsement by journals in fields related to extensions. Methods and analysis Two independent researchers will assess additions in each extension. Additions will be coded as ‘field specific’ (FS) or ‘not field specific’ (NFS). FS is defined as particularly relevant information for a single field and guidance provided generally cannot be extrapolated beyond that field. NFS is defined as information that reflects epidemiological or methodological tenets and can be generalised to most, if not all, types of observational research studies. Intraclass correlation will be calculated to measure reviewers’ concordance. On disagreement, consensus will be sought. Individual additions will be grouped by STROBE checklist items to identify the frequency and distribution of changes. Journals in fields related to extensions will be identified through National Library of Medicine PubMed Broad Subject Terms, screened for eligibility and further distilled via Ovid MEDLINE® search strategies for observational studies. Text describing endorsement will be extracted from each journal’s website. A classification scheme will be created for endorsement types and the prevalence of endorsement will be estimated. Analyses will use NVivo V.11 and SAS University Edition. Ethics and dissemination This study does not require ethical approval as it does not involve human participants.

A simulation-based exploratory study is conducted to better understand community traits that confer increased diversity and resilience in such global participatory systems. Five types of interaction topologies are identified and simulated using agent simulation as a method of inquiry.

Without such explicit intellectual property rights and licensing, how is such open science commercialized? This paper examines the commercialization of Claude Shannon's theory of communications, developed at and freely disseminated by Bell Telephone Laboratories. It analyses the first 25 years of Shannon theory, the role of MIT in developing and extending that theory, and the importance of deep space communications as the initial market for commercialization. It contrasts the early paths of two MIT-related spinoffs that pursued this opportunity, including key technical and business trajectories driven by information theory. Based on this evidence, the paper provides observations about commercializing open science, particularly for engineering-related fields.",2162692397,Joel West

The European Commission (EC) is also supporting the development of FOSS [...]. In addition to the financial savings, FOSS contributes to scientific knowledge freedom in computational science (CS) and is increasingly rewarded in the science-policy interface within the emerging paradigm of open science. Since complex computational science applications may be affected by software uncertainty, FOSS may help to mitigate part of the impact of software errors by CS community- driven open review, correction and evolution of scientific code. The continental scale of EC science-based policy support implies wide networks of scientific collaboration. Thematic information systems also may benefit from this approach within reproducible integrated modelling. This is supported by the EC strategy on FOSS: ""for the development of new information systems, where deployment is foreseen by parties outside of the EC infrastructure, [F]OSS will be the preferred choice and in any case used whenever possible"". The aim of this contribution is to highlight how a continental scale information system may exploit and integrate FOSS technologies within the transdisciplinary research underpinning such a complex system. A European example is discussed where FOSS innervates both the structure of the information system itself and the inherent transdisciplinary research for modelling the data and information which constitute the system content.

Open Science is ‘the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society’.

In the spirit of the Open Science movement, advance publication of protocols for clinical trials is now being advocated by BioMed Central, BMJ Open and others. Simultaneously, participants are becoming increasingly active in their pursuit and sharing of trial- and health- related information. Whilst access to protocols alongside published trial findings has clear benefits, advance publication of trial protocols is potentially problematic for trials of complex behavioural interventions. In this article we explain, with examples, how this could lead to unblinding, ‘contamination’ between intervention and control groups and deliberate biasing of assessment outcomes by participants. We discuss potential solutions and demonstrate the need for public debate about how this issue is best managed.",2155546866; 2115022875; 2025308725,Anna Basu; Janice Pearse; Tim Rapley

In recent years, researchers have introduced many new adjectives to refer to personal networks (e.g. local) and social networks (e.g. complete, global, sociocentric, sociometric and whole). I discuss desirable properties of scientific terminology and argue that each of the new terms is superfluous and misapplied. I conclude by suggesting that any mention of the new terms should at least involve explicit cross-referencing with the established terms, and that abandoning the new terms altogether in favor of the established terms would be even better. ",2139937948,Devon D.

This emergent pathogen has been relatively poorly studied and little is known about its genetic make-up. In response to the arrival of this dangerous pathogen in the UK we took the unusual step of providing an open access database and initial sequence datasets to the scientific community for analysis prior to performing an analysis of our own. Our goal was to crowdsource genomic and other analyses and create a community analysing this pathogen. In this report on the evolution of the community and data and analysis obtained in the first year of this activity, we describe the nature and the volume of the contributions and reveal some preliminary insights into the genome and biology of H. pseudoalbidus that emerged. In particular our nascent community generated a first-pass genome assembly containing abundant collapsed AT-rich repeats indicating a typically complex genome structure. Our open science and crowdsourcing effort has brought a wealth of new knowledge about this emergent pathogen within a short time-frame. Our community endeavour highlights the positive impact that open, collaborative approaches can have on fast, responsive modern science.",189156805,Matthew Bashton

We highlight the value of GCIPs by focusing on recent efforts targeting the ecological sciences, where GCIPs are of high relevance given the urgent need for interdisciplinary, geographical, and cross-sector collaboration to cope with growing challenges to the environment as well as the scientific community itself. Amidst the emergence of new international institutions, organizations, and meetings, GCIPs provide a stable international infrastructure for rapid and long-term coordination that can be accessed by any individual. This accessibility can be especially important for researchers early in their careers. Recent examples of early-career GCIPs complement an array of existing options for early-career scientists to improve skill sets, increase academic and social impact, and broaden career opportunities. We provide a number of examples of existing early-career initiatives that incorporate elements from the GCIPs approach, and highlight an in-depth case study from the ecological sciences: the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists (INNGE), initiated in 2010 with support from the International Association for Ecology and 20 member institutions from six continents.",2138883918; 1884690006; 1894365499; 2288904174; 2116572356; 2118400457; 2128082227; 13091674; 1928407014; 2704117342; 1121541867; 288615361; 2152582196; 2780698389; 1994166799,Peter Søgaard Jørgensen; Roberto Salguero-Gómez; Lucía DeSoto; Brian Swartz; Jennifer M.

Unfortunately, while the performance efficiency of GPUs is well understood, their resilience characteristics in a large-scale computing system have not been fully evaluated. We present a detailed study to provide a thorough understanding of GPU errors on a large-scale GPU-enabled system. Our data was collected from the Titan supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility and a GPU cluster at the Los Alamos National Laboratory. We also present results from our extensive neutron-beam tests, conducted at Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) and at ISIS (Rutherford Appleron Laboratories, UK), to measure the resilience of different generations of GPUs. We present several findings from our field data and neutron-beam experiments, and discuss the implications of our results for future GPU architects, current and future HPC computing facilities, and researchers focusing on GPU resilience.",2136352167; 2008884277; 2157481769; 1556529146; 2594352651; 2095907042; 2141535091; 2031181826; 2151101088; 2482443214; 2231398341; 17306338,Devesh Tiwari; Philippe Olivier Alexandre Navaux; Luigi Carro; Arthur S.

These resources serve many virtual organisations and contribute a large fraction of total worldwide resources for the ATLAS experiment, whose data is distributed and managed by the DQ2 software. Managing ATLAS data within NDGF and between NDGF and other Grids used by ATLAS (the Enabling Grids for E-sciencE Grid and the Open Science Grid) presents a unique challenge for several reasons. Firstly, the entry point for data, the Tier 1 centre, is physically distributed among heterogeneous resources in several countries and yet must present a single access point for all data stored within the centre. The middleware framework used in NDGF differs significantly from other Grids, specifically in the way that all data movement and registration is performed by services outside the worker node environment. Also, the service used for cataloging the location of data files is different from other Grids but must still be useable by DQ2 and ATLAS users to locate data within NDGF. This paper presents in detail how we solve these issues to allow seamless access worldwide to data within NDGF.",2130379315; 2125522737; 2703010869; 2268507028; 2772551308,Gerd Behrmann; D.

Yet they can be too easily forgotten in the push for ""intellectual quality"". My research suggests that this is counterproductive since the two dimensions are integrally related, especially for students from non-advantaged backgrounds. In some subjects, the stylistic norms of the culture (cf. Lemke 1990) result in many students feeling excluded from legitimate belonging and hence full access. This can result in lowered intellectual engagement and poor retention rates in the subject, with junior secondary science being a case in point in many Western countries including Australia (cf. Goodrum, Hackling & Rennie 2001). However, there is evidence that some teachers do manage to engage most of their middle years' students in science, which begs the question, ""How do they do it?"" This has been the topic of my most recent research project. In this paper I will attempt to demonstrate my findings that such teachers use language in subtle ways that open science up to new audiences. They creatively hybridise the traditional genres, discourses and styles of school science in ways which recognise, value and/or accept - or at least allow for - difference, and which invite and reward active participation by all students. Using the tools of critical discourse analysis (CDA, Fairclough 2003) I will illustrate my points about access-enhancing teacher discourse practices with excerpts from the lessons of two successful science teachers.",2140848774,Mary U.

The major focus of the FIFE project is the development, deployment, and integration of Open Science Grid solutions for high throughput computing, data management, database access and collaboration within experiment. To accomplish this goal, FIFE has developed workflows that utilize Open Science Grid sites along with dedicated and commercial cloud resources. The FIFE project has made significant progress integrating into experiment computing operations several services including new job submission services, software and reference data distribution through CVMFS repositories, flexible data transfer client, and access to opportunistic resources on the Open Science Grid. Hence, the progress with current experiments and plans for expansion with additional projects will be discussed.

However, relatively few resources have been made accessible to the potentially large group of Earth science and engineering users. New users have to invest an extraordinary effort to study the models. To provide a stimulating experience focusing on the learning curve of integrated modeling of coupled surface-subsurface flow, we describe use cases of an open source model, the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model, PIHM. New users were guided through data processing and model application by reproducing a numerical benchmark problem and a real-world watershed simulation. Specifically, we document the PIHM application and its computational workflow to enable intuitive understanding of coupled surface-subsurface flow processes. In addition, we describe the user experience as important evidence of the significance of reusability. The interaction shows that documentation of data, software, and computational workflow in research papers is a promising method to foster open scientific collaboration and reuse. This study demonstrates how open science practice in research papers would promote the utility of open source software. Addressing such open science practice in publications would promote the utility of journal papers.

The European Commission launched the Europe 2020 strategy in 2010 to tackle the transformation of Europe and the world since the beginning of the 21st Century. The main objective of the strategy was to prepare the European Community for the major challenges of the decade and, among the various development and innovation actions, also the creation of an infrastructure in the hybrid or federalized cloud model that would meet the computing needs of these institutions linked to science and research. In this work, we examine the circumstances that led the European Union to create the EOSC. We also present the main characteristics that are part of the concepts of cloud computing, such as the consolidation and dynamic use of shared computational resources. We conclude that the creation of cloud computing infrastructure for scientific research for the European Union is a strategic need for the region and that many technical and social challenges should be considered for its implementation, the latter being the most relevant for the current panorama.",2768200146; 2144572594; 2303756974,Ariovaldo Veiga de Almeida; Maria Manuel Borges; Licinio Roque

It's time to bring in new leadership and a new vision. As scientists we generally do not learn a lot of management skills (a mistake in my opinion), but if I have learnt two management skills it is the value of enablement and to start planning for your successor on day one. Well, I did not start on day one, but Ruth Nussinov has been the Deputy Editor-in-Chief since October 2008, and she is an outstanding scientist and editor ideally suited to take over as editor-in-chief. So please welcome Ruth to this leadership role. The journal is in very safe hands. The journal staff, editors, and Ruth have not seen the last of me, however—this is just too much fun. As Founding Editor-in-Chief, I will continue to be involved with the journal, with a focus on special projects, helping Ruth and the team where I can, and, of course, continue as an author of both research articles and front matter, such as the Ten Simple Rules series.

In changing roles, I would like to make a few personal comments about the evolution of the journal and where it might go next. When Steven Brenner, Michael Eisen, and I founded the journal, we had a vision for how it would fill a gap between journals supporting purely computational methods and the array of experimental journals with the odd, token computational paper [1]. Thanks to you, the readers and authors, that vision has been realized beyond what we imagined, and I am very proud of how the journal is a voice for our broad and important community and at the same time helps build that community. The appearance of the journal in June 2005 was timely since it both propelled our field of science at a time when it was being recognized as a critical part of the life sciences, and made a strong statement about the importance of open access.

I must confess that when we started planning for the journal in 2004, support for open access seemed like the right thing to do, but it was not a major driver for me. That changed when, early on in my tenure, I realized open access is critical to maximizing the rate of scientific discovery. Supporting open access, and the new forms of scholarly communication it fosters, enriched my career and brought me into contact with many amazing people I would not otherwise have met. Emphasizing that enrichment, of the 22 invited lectures I gave in 2011, 18 were evangelizing about the importance of open access and open science, and four were directly related to my science. In my opinion, we have yet to see open access reach its full potential, but we will [2], and our journal will be poised to play an ever-increasing role as an exemplar for what is possible. In short, PLOS and this journal will continue to foster change, which maximizes the accessibility and comprehension of science. I am proud to continue to be a part of that.

It only remains for me to thank and acknowledge a variety of people who have all been so critically important in the past seven years. First and foremost are the approximately 150 editors who have worked tirelessly to shape and ensure a high-quality product over the years. There is no journal without community-driven efforts, which offer limited reward beyond a job well done. I can't mention everyone, but I must call out Karl Friston, who between 2005 and 2010 worked tirelessly to make computational neuroscience such a rich part of the journal, and Steven Brenner, Simon Levin, and Sebastian Bonhoeffer, who, since the journal's inception, have always responded with good advice.

Thanks are also due to Mark Patterson, who, until late 2011, was Director of Publishing at PLOS. Mark was critical to the success of the journal and to PLOS as a whole. We first began talking about the journal in May 2004, and he listened to, refined, and contributed to a lot of crazy ideas that define what the journal is today. To Catherine Nancarrow, who managed the journal from 2005 to 2010. A nicer and more dedicated person will not be found. In the current era of 140 character snapshots, her emails conferred a quality, beauty, and caring that you just don't see anymore. To Evie Browne, who contributed so much as Publications Assistant and Publications Manager between 2006 and 2009. Her spreadsheet analyses of how the journal was doing were amazing. To Andy Collings, who in various roles from Publications Assistant to Editorial Manager from 2005 to 2012 just made all ideas work, however outside the box they were. To Fran Lewitter, who, as Education Editor since the beginning, has created an important community jewel. To Scott Markel, who has been a voice of reason and an interface to the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) over the years. Finally, to all the other staff who have contributed over the past seven years: Emily Stevenson, Johanna Dehlinger, Helen Budd, Sheran Basra, and Cecy Marden, and the amazing current staff of Laura Taylor, Clare Weaver, and Chris Hall, all so well led by Rosemary Dickin and Theo Bloom.

PLOS is a family of journals and a family of people; in short, a family organization whose goal is to disseminate science in the most open and useful way possible. It is a successful organization able to recruit the best and most dedicated staff, and to adjust to its growing success and the success of open access itself. The world of scientific publishing will never be the same again because of PLOS and the people who drive it. I am proud to continue to be a member of this amazing family. There is no other publisher like PLOS and no other journal like PLOS Computational Biology.",2151520125,Philip E. Bourne

Funders have been particularly active in demanding change. Although they vary in the degree of openness required and in their interpretation of what a more open approach actually constitutes, there is now a near consensus that at the very least open access must apply to published research results and some funders increasingly require access to research data as well. In addition to funder requirements, other drivers of increasing openness include calls from a variety of stakeholders including researchers themselves for more transparency and less duplication in research.

It is too early to give a definitive answer to the question posed in the title to this chapter. But asking the question at this time is a useful exercise as it encourages us to reflect on the current situation and to begin to analyze current trends, drivers and enablers related to open science based collaboration as well as obstacles and tensions associated with open and global access to science. This chapter endeavours to begin that work and to identify some of the policy challenges associated with moves towards more open science. The chapter is structured around a number of sub-questions to the title’s overall question and concludes with some reflections on the implications for policy-making.",2043183357; 2200431685; 2595305341,Joanna Chataway; Sarah Parks; Elta Smith

Es gibt Synergien, was die Einbindung von Burgerinnen und Burger sowie die Zuganglichkeit von Forschungsergebnissen und -prozessen angeht. Risiken bestehen, wenn Citizen Science lediglich instrumentalisiert wird, ohne Burgerinnen und Burgern eine echte Teilhabe zu ermoglichen.",2597993443; 2539924754,Katrin Vohland; Claudia Göbel

Distributed invention power is organised and regulated through the pervasive securitisation of technoscience: surveillance and control of technoscientific fields as well as financialisation of its activities and research outputs. The securitisation of science reorders the traditional split between the public sphere, the private sector and the commons. The folding of each one of these spheres into the other underlies a constant, often antagonistic, oscillation between big science and open science. What is constitutive of the diverse movements that sustain open technoscience is not that they challenge technoscience as such but that they experiment with technoscience to create alternative forms...",2163695357,Dimitris Papadopoulos

Assuming that the complementary innovations constitute a common input and that agents make complementary investments in its private exploitation, we find that, when complementarities are sufficiently strong, a commitment to openness may provide greater incentives than an exclusion strategy.

It has long been accepted that building research on the foundations laid by other scientists is both effective and efficient. Regrettably, some disciplines, chemistry being one, have been slow to recognise the value of sharing and have thus been reluctant to curate their data and information in preparation for exchanging it. The very significant increases in both the volume and the complexity of the datasets produced has encouraged the expansion of e-Research, and stimulated the development of methodologies for managing, organising, and analysing “big data”. We review the evolution of cheminformatics, the amalgam of chemistry, computer science, and information technology, and assess the wider e-Science and e-Research perspective. Chemical information does matter, as do matters of communicating data and collaborating with data. For chemistry, unique identifiers, structure representations, and property descriptors are essential to the activities of sharing and exchange. Open science entails the sharing of more than mere facts: for example, the publication of negative outcomes can facilitate better understanding of which synthetic routes to choose, an aspiration of the Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge. The protagonists of open notebook science go even further and exchange their thoughts and plans. We consider the concepts of preservation, curation, provenance, discovery, and access in the context of the research lifecycle, and then focus on the role of metadata, particularly the ontologies on which the emerging chemical Semantic Web will depend. Among our conclusions, we present our choice of the “grand challenges” for the preservation and sharing of chemical information.",2100158982; 2140911096,Colin Leonard Bird; Jeremy G. Frey

However, very little is known about the training needs of these editors or what competencies are required to perform effectively in this role.

Methods: We conducted a survey of perceptions and training needs among scientific editors from major editorial organizations around the world, followed by a modified Delphi process in which we invited the same scientific editors to rate the importance of competency-related statements obtained from a previous scoping review.

Results: A total of 148 participants completed the survey of perceptions and training needs. At least 80% of participants agreed on six of the 38 skill and expertise-related statements presented to them as being important or very important to their role as scientific editors. At least 80% agreed on three of the 38 statements as necessary skills they perceived themselves as possessing (well or very well). The top five items on participants’ list of top training needs were training in statistics, research methods, publication ethics, recruiting and dealing with peer reviewers, and indexing of journals. The three rounds of the Delphi were completed by 83, 83, and 73 participants, respectively, which ultimately produced a list of 23 “highly rated” competency-related statements and another 86 “included” items.

Conclusion: Both the survey and the modified Delphi process will be critical for understanding knowledge and training gaps among scientific editors when designing curriculum around core competencies in the future.",2156181505; 2051147632; 2026416190; 204361474; 2785362203; 2619421655; 2697461952; 2762617834; 1358494281; 2053137549; 1433102634; 2753643170,James Galipeau; Peter Tugwell; Margaret A.

The effort is fundamentally collaborative, with domain scientists, computer scientists and technology specialists and providers from more than 70 U.S. universities, national laboratories and organizations providing resources, tools and expertise. The evolving OSG facility provides computing and storage resources for particle and nuclear physics, gravitational wave experiments, digital astronomy, molecular genomics, nanoscience and applied mathematics. The OSG consortium also partners with campus and regional grids, large projects such as TeraGrid [2], Earth System Grid [3], Enabling Grids for E–sciencE (EGEE [4]) in Europe and related efforts in South America and Asia to facilitate interoperability across national and international boundaries.
	OSG’s experience broadly illustrates the breadth and scale of effort that a diverse, evolving collaboration must undertake in building and sustaining large–scale cyberinfrastructure serving multiple communities. Scalability — in resource size, number of member organizations and application diversity — remains a central concern. As a result, many interesting [5] challenges continue to emerge and their resolution requires engaged partners and creative adjustments.",2619703295,Paul Avery

It is first argued that the very characteristics of software goods – ubiquity and network externalities, but also complexity and codification issues – open the way for the creation of a new status of ‘generic software’, similar to generic drugs, in order to correct both the creativity and the quality dilemma for software. Generic OSS would compete with proprietary software solutions in a more efficient market structure as it would combine two complementary sources of innovations, both from proprietary software producers through “software cloning” and from users thanks to learning by doing. Proprietary software producers would also find greater incentives to invest in R&D due to the existence of a generic alternative to their products. Second, we stress the importance of other sources for Open-Source software innovations, and notably of LaTeXlike, as opposed to Linux-like, OSS. More generally, software developed in academic labs is extremely suitable to be OSS because scientists are by definition lead users, because Academic OSS can be used for peer-reviewed publishing, and because the workings of OSS communities are particularly close to those of Open Science ones. However, the “non-sexywork” issue in OSS is structurally similar to the well-known issue about the efficiency of science-industry technology transfer: taken together, both effects might reinforce each other and create major inefficiencies. But here modularity allows for “Open Academic Software” to consistently solve this issue, and therefore reciprocally suggest another efficient institutional implementation of OSS.",2426318353,Jean-Michel Dalle

This effort was launched to refine and revise a legacy system and more than 15 years' worth of incremental improvements; to better integrate and position the allocations service within the XSEDE infrastructure; and to help streamline the allocations processes across a broader set of cyberinfrastructure investments. Because the allocation processes for most high-performance computing providers are typically variations on a common high-level approach, XRAS can deliver allocations software-as-a-service through a set of common tools and interfaces enhanced by flexible mechanisms that allow clients to tailor the environment to meet the needs of their process. By offering such a service to the eScience community, we can leverage the unique expertise of the XSEDE team and expand opportunities for open science by sharing the interfaces needed to manage resource allocations for both large and small institutions.",2121343216; 2224985475; 2226329178; 2151299396; 2120115517,David L.

Though idea of openness i.e. open science and open access to information sources is not new, it is still not universally accepted and it is not understood equally in all parts of the world. The greatest benefits of open access can be observed in academic activities i.e. in research and teaching at academic institutions. However, open access is not understood and presented equally everywhere. There are differences in openness and rights of users in access and use of scientific and educational materials in open access digital repositories. While the number of open access digital repositories increases there are many questions waiting to be answered from quality of content, roles in management of open access information resources, responsibility for maintenance of digital information resources, financing of digital information resources, quality of scientific and educational digital resources etc.",2226918248,Radovan Vrana

Our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a scientific format. Besides considering a dimension internal to the firm, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime. We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French innovation survey (CIS) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 R&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant. Furthermore, the results suggest that the inclination of firms to publish is sensitive to the level of knowledge spillovers in a sector and the effectiveness of legal appropriation instruments.",2640021814; 2123557865,Markus Simeth; Julio Raffo

One of the major advantages is represented by the reduced effort required by the user communities (also known as Virtual Organizations or VOs) due to the outsourcing of the Grid interfacing services, i.e. the pilot factory, to Grid experts. One such pilot factory, based on the glideinWMS pilot infrastructure, is being operated by the Open Science Grid at University of California San Diego (UCSD). This pilot factory is serving multiple VOs from several scientific domains. Currently the three major clients are the analysis operations of the HEP experiment CMS, the community VO HCC, which serves mostly math, biology and computer science users, and the structural biology VO NEBioGrid. The UCSD glidein factory allows the served VOs to use Grid resources distributed over 150 sites in North and South America, in Europe, and in Asia.

This activity delivered a common authorization protocol and a set of libraries that implement that protocol. In addition, a set of the most common Grid gateways, or Policy Enforcement Points (Globus Toolkit v4 Gatekeeper, GridFTP, dCache, etc.) and site authorization services, or Policy Decision Points (LCAS/LCMAPS, SCAS, GUMS, etc.) have been integrated with these libraries. At this time, various software providers, including the Globus Toolkit v5, BeStMan, and the Site AuthoriZation service (SAZ), are integrating the authorization interoperability protocol with their products. In addition, as more and more software supports the same protocol, the community is converging on LCMAPS as a common module for identity attribute parsing and authorization call-out. This paper presents this effort, discusses the status of adoption of the common protocol and projects the community work on authorization in the near future.",25894833; 2676613907; 2573742000; 2286898990; 2764902520; 2765037057; 1975938667; 2080947717; 2126148120; 2764923374; 2777144656; 2764353814; 2015623578; 2780812396; 2091181715,Gabriele Garzoglio; S Martin; M Salle; N Sharma; A Sim; S Timm; A Verstegen; Joseph Bester; Keith Chadwick; D Dykstra; D Groep; J Gu; T.

It also aimed to test the feasibility of an OECD global survey on science with a focus on major emerging policy issues. This online, email-based pilot survey was based on a stratified random sample of corresponding authors of publications listed in a major global scientific publication index across seven diverse, hand-picked science domains. The results provide evidence of the extent of journal and repository-based open access, data sharing practices, the link between different forms of open access to research and research impact, and the decoupling of quality assurance and access roles played by journals. The results point to the importance of considering economic incentives and social norms in developing policy options for open access. The findings also provide new insights on scientist careers, mobility and gender pay bias.",2530364699; 1981506320,Brunella Boselli; Fernando Galindo-Rueda

The potential rate of growth in conventional universities is limited and many look towards online, distance learning as a mechanism for addressing the rapidly growing shortage of graduates. But the limited range of online opportunities for undergraduates to develop and practise practical skills leads to scepticism that distance learning is viable in engineering. The Open University has recently been awarded £1 million to create the Wolfson Open Science Laboratory, 'a global centre at the cutting edge of practical science teaching - operated entirely online' (Open University, 2012). The University is committed to extending the Centre to include engineering. But there is, as yet, no widely-shared agreement over the role of practical work in the education of engineers that could lead to a strategy for such an initiative to gain worldwide acceptance (Feisel and Rosa, 2005). Movements such as CDIO (CDIO, 2012) have emphasised practical, problem-solving skills as the focus for effective engineering education but their approaches often present challenges for large-scale distance learning. If the benefits in scale and reach of online distance education are to be exploited to dramatically increase the supply of engineering graduates, there is an urgent need to develop a consensus on the role of practical learning activities in engineering education. This workshop will provide a forum to explore these and related issues.",2092496701; 2781360252; 2576858975; 2119695274; 2110055984,Mark Endean; Alec Goodyear; Jon James; Jan Kowal; Keith Williams

In support of this, the Texas Advanced Computing Center presents Wrangler, the first open science research platform built from the ground up in support of data. Wrangler features a replicated 10 PB Lustre based parallel file system, compute capacity of 120 Intel Haswell nodes and 15 TB of RAM. In addition to the base system, Wrangler features a unique NAND flash-based storage system from DSSD, providing users with 0.5 PB of storage 1 TB/s bandwidth and 250 million IOP/s across the cluster. Supporting Hadoop, but not just Hadoop, Wrangler will provide current and future researchers with an environment supporting the most I/O intensive workflows in fields from astronomy to paleontology. With data at the forefront of Wrangler's mission, support for ETL workflows, data curation, and data publication will enable users as they both discover new results and publish their own research. Support for both SQL and noSQL databases and GIS based extensions will also be provided, allowing users to leverage these tools for both data cataloging and cross-study integration. Wrangler will allow users to focus more on what is most important to them, the data and knowledge gained from its analysis, and less on the details of curation and I/O optimization.",2163065543; 2293752541; 2572554035; 2133644482,Niall Ives Gaffney; Chris Jordan; Tommy Minyard; Dan Stanzione

Within this context digitalization demonstrates strong impact on human capital and tangible assets (infrastructures and information processing tools etc.) by means of enhancing sources of new knowledge. Hence, challenges arise on the useful and proper utilization of numerous opportunities which emerged from digitalization. What are the new challenges for S&T systems caused by digitalization and what mechanisms could be implemented for system adaptation to them? What are the new research skills that are a high priority to acquire both by individuals and system as a whole? The paper argues that STI policy thus far hasn’t demonstrated sufficient responses to the changing requirements on researcher skills but remains at the infrastructural discussion.",2132044947; 2615037348; 2541581046,Dirk Meissner; Narkhova Anastasiia; Plekhanov Dmitry

We distinguish between firm-level indicators of applied research using patents and indicators of basic research using scientific publications in 'hard science' journals. We look at total factor productivity and growth as measures of firm performance. Our results indicate that the relation of performance with patents is stronger for small firms than for large firms. By contrast, the relation of performance with scientific publications is stronger for large firms than for small firms. Patenting is beneficial especially to small firms, while publications are by far the strongest indicator of success for large firms. Many small firms appear to publish for non-pecuniary reasons (e.g., a 'taste' for open science). Important differences across technology fields are found.",2343260821; 2237257542,Andrea Patacconi; Sharon Belenzon

It is also the first text to explain the new and exciting Open Science practices, which encourage replication and enhance the trustworthiness of research. In addition, the book explains NHST fully so students can understand published research. Numerous real research examples are used throughout. The book uses todays most effective learning strategies and promotes critical thinking, comprehension, and retention, to deepen users understanding of statistics and modern research methods. The free ESCI (Exploratory Software for Confidence Intervals) software makes concepts visually vivid, and provides calculation and graphing facilities. The book can be used with or without ESCI. Other highlights include: - Coverage of both estimation and NHST approaches, and how to easily translate between the two. - Some exercises use ESCI to analyze data and create graphs including CIs, for best understanding of estimation methods. -Videos of the authors describing key concepts and demonstrating use of ESCI provide an engaging learning tool for traditional or flipped classrooms. -In-chapter exercises and quizzes with related commentary allow students to learn by doing, and to monitor their progress. -End-of-chapter exercises and commentary, many using real data, give practice for using the new statistics to analyze data, as well as for applying research judgment in realistic contexts. -Dont fool yourself tips help students avoid common errors. -Red Flags highlight the meaning of ""significance"" and what p values actually mean. -Chapter outlines, defined key terms, sidebars of key points, and summarized take-home messages provide a study tool at exam time. -http://www.routledge.com/cw/cumming offers for students: ESCI downloads; data sets; key term flashcards; tips for using SPSS for analyzing data; and videos. For instructors it offers: tips for teaching the new statistics and Open Science; additional homework exercises; assessment items; answer keys for homework and assessment items; and downloadable text images; and PowerPoint lecture slides. Intended for introduction to statistics, data analysis, or quantitative methods courses in psychology, education, and other social and health sciences, researchers interested in understanding the new statistics will also appreciate this book.

With a critique of reason itself,the critique philosophy not only provides foundations and boundaries for all natural sciences,but also identifies metaphysics as a domain of noumena (or ideas),which transcends the aesthetical-empirical. Nevertheless,Kantian metaphysics differs from the traditional metaphysics in that it tends to be scientific by demarcating the domain of the empirical world,and the very boundaries are noumena—— ideas—— things-in-themselves. Ideas are not only the limits of application of concepts of understanding,but also the regulative principle for applying concepts of understanding to the empirical world. In this sense,while the kingdom of knowledge is forever progressing,Kantian metaphysics is an open science about limits.",2713690099,Ye Xiu-sha

The Act is similar in scope and objective to the American Bayh-Dole Act. This paper explores some of the problems created or exacerbated by the Bayh-Dole Act and considers lessons that South Africa could learn from the United States’ experience. Traditionally, American innovation was based on a philosophy of open science. Universities conducted basic foundational research which was freely available to others who wanted to commercialise and build on it, or use it for further scientific research. The Bayh-Dole Act changed the model of science to a proprietary model. One of the problems this created was increased patenting of foundational research tools such as genes and cell-lines that follow-on researchers require for their own research. Sometimes, research has been blocked or impeded by an inability to obtain research licences to the patented research on reasonable terms. The Act has also had a negative effect on scientific collaboration and publishing. The paper suggests ways in which South Africa might avoid similar problems when implementing the IPR Act. These include research and experimental use exemptions; compulsory licensing provisions; and open-access patents.",2396127139,Amanda Barratt

While the journal labels itself as a PLoS “community” journal, if that label has any true meaning, it must come from the community itself. We feel that, after six years, we are indeed serving the community well, but as always you can disagree at any time, either publicly with a comment in response to this article or by email (gro.solp@loibpmocsolp).

That service comes first and foremost from the research we publish, but also from our desire to educate, report on open-source software, provide a history of the field, capture the vision of our editors, and move beyond the boundaries of traditional publishing to inform people within and outside of our community. Before we take a look at developments in each of these areas, and what is to come in 2012, let us first review how we served the community in 2011.

According to Google Analytics, 2011 saw over 553,000 unique visitors to our website and more than two million article views (not including access statistics from PubMed Central). Visitors came from 211 countries/territories, which was undoubtedly helped by the fact that the journal is open access. India, Spain, Russia, and Iran each showed over a 40% increase in visitors from the previous year. From the journal website, the most accessed Research Article was “Effect of Promoter Architecture on the Cell-to-Cell Variability in Gene Expression” by Sanchez et al. [1], published in March 2011 (8,954 views at the time of writing); the most accessed article overall was “Ten Simple Rules for Building and Maintaining a Scientific Reputation” by Bourne and Barbour [2], published in June 2011 (15,255 views at the time of writing).

Also in 2011, 1,623 research articles from 57 countries were submitted, up 16% from 2010, and 384 were published (down 2% from 2010). Receiving more but publishing about the same number in real terms should reflect the increasing quality of our content. We are very grateful to our Associate Editors, Guest Editors, reviewers (a list of Guest Editors and reviewers from 2011 is available in Table S1), and, of course, our Deputy Editors – Patricia Babbitt, Joel Bader, Sebastian Bonhoeffer, Lyle J. Graham, Konrad Kording, Douglas Lauffenburger, Uwe Ohler, Nathan Price, Burkhard Rost, Olaf Sporns, Wyeth Wasserman, and Weixiong Zhang – for helping us to handle this growth. With this growth, we have not met our goal of reducing the times to first decision, even with the addition of new editors, but we will continue to work on this in 2012. Our median decision before review time in 2011 was 8 days, and our median decision after review time was 47 days.

A number of our Research Articles were featured in blogs and the popular press. Notably, Mitra Hartman's paper on the morphology of the rat vibrissal array [3] was covered extensively, including two videos, by National Public Radio and Science Bytes.

Our Software section was launched in August 2011, and we have so far published one article, with six more either accepted or under review. Uptake has been relatively slow, based on, we believe, the open source and stringent documentation requirements we have imposed. We believe it is better to publish only a few, but high-quality, software articles, and that this will highlight the lack of rigor of software otherwise in the field.

Our Education section has continued to flourish, in part because of the journal's relationship with the International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB). This year we introduced a collection, Bioinformatics: Starting Early, which takes the notion of biology as a computational science into secondary schools. We are hoping for more articles from those involved in secondary teaching in 2012. Open science removes all boundaries not only to reading the latest science, but also to contributing to that science. We have even seen secondary school students as authors and expect to see more in the future.

In July 2011 we began the Editors Outlook series, with five published [4]–[8] and more on the way. These mini-reviews already broach subjects from ontologies to genome organization, and from evolution to data and privacy. They speak to the breadth of our field and editorial board, and collectively will form a vision from our many expert editors of what is being, and will be, accomplished in the coming years.

That our journal is fully open access provides opportunities for maximizing the use and reuse of our scholarship; we intend to explore this further in 2012. Early in 2012 we will launch our first Topic Page on circular permutations in proteins. Wikipedia is a valuable resource for knowledge dissemination, yet Wikipedia pages are lacking in coverage of computational biology. In part this is because authors gain little career-based reward for creating Wikipedia pages. We aim to bridge the gap. Topic Page articles, which will be published in the journal and will each receive a PubMed identifier and DOI, will become the copy of record, thereby crediting the author(s). At the same time the Topic Page will be used to seed a Wikipedia article and become a living version of the same material–a viable option thanks to our Creative Commons license. Look for an announcement of this development in the new year, but in the interim if you have ideas for Topic Pages you would like to contribute, please do get in touch for further information (gro.solp@loibpmocsolp).

We are also contemplating a new article type: Data Pages. Data Pages would be brief publications about datasets, in which the data are not already well described in other papers yet are considered of great value to the community. Such brief publications would bring a traditional reward to the producers of these shared datasets. Which is more valuable: a dataset downloaded and used by 100 investigators, who in turn publish research based on these data, or a paper that is cited only by the authors who wrote it? Data Pages would, from our point of view, help to answer this question.

If you want to provide feedback on our plans for Data Pages later in 2012, please do so by commenting on this article. Feel free to comment in public or to us privately on anything we are doing, or ideas that you have for the future of the journal. After all, PLoS Computational Biology is a community journal, and if you have read this far, you should consider yourself an important part of our ever-broadening community.",2494493660; 2503611605; 2324376001; 2487826908; 2151520125,Rosemary Dickin; Cecy Marden; Andrew M.

The traditional way of publishing new findings in journals is becoming increasingly outdated and no longer serves the needs of much of science. Whilst preprints can bring significant benefits of removing delay and selection, they do not go far enough if simply implemented alongside the existing journal system. We propose that we need a new approach, an Open Science Platform, that takes the benefits of preprints but adds formal, invited, and transparent post-publication peer review. This bypasses the problems of the current journal system and, in doing so, moves the evaluation of research and researchers away from the journal-based Impact Factor and towards a fairer system of article-based qualitative and quantitative indicators. In the long term, it should be irrelevant where a researcher publishes their findings. What is important is that research is shared and made available without delay within a framework that encourages quality standards and requires all players in the research community to work as collaborators.",2632208027; 2225279332,Vitek Tracz; Rebecca Lawrence

A description of the RDM context in Canada is provided. This environment has heightened expectations around the Government of Canada’s Open Science plans and includes deliverables aimed at improving access to publications and data resulting from federally funded scientific activities. At the same time, a recent environmental scan published by Canada’s three federal research granting councils reveals significant gaps in services, infrastructure, and funding mechanisms to support RDM. In addition, Canada’s RDM environment consists of stakeholders from a variety of communities with minimal ongoing coordination or cooperation. The Portage network was conceived as a collaborative network model based on libraries’ strong connections with researchers across the disciplines, an ethos of curation and preservation, and experience with systems for managing data in all its forms. A pilot project provided Portage with a vision and set of principles, and identified several objectives as the small wins that would build the trust and shared understanding required for a successful network. Current services and activities of Portage, including a data management planning tool and an infrastructure project, are described in this paper. Portage now faces the challenge of moving from project to operational network, and the challenge of establishing a sustainable governance model. CARL appointed a Steering Committee that will be proposing a full governance model at the conclusion of this transition period. Using a framework of factors identified in the literature, several relevant collaborative and network governance models are being explored. This paper outlines experience to date with Portage and matters under consideration for long-term sustainability, with a goal of engaging international colleagues in discussion and furthering the concepts for the benefit of RDM networks everywhere.",2711296980; 2589067881; 2606923315,Chuck Humphrey; Kathleen Shearer; Martha Whitehead

Research Parasites . Scientific Reproducibility . Citizen science . Mozilla, the producer of the Firefox browser, has started an Open Science initiative. Open science really hit the mainstream in 2016. So what is open science? Depending on who you ask, it simply means more timely and regular releases of data sets, and publication in open-access journals. Others imagine a more radical transformation of science and scholarship and are advocating "" open-notebook "" science with a continuous public record of scientific work and concomitant release of open data. In this more expansive vision: science will be ultimately transformed from a series of static snapshots represented by papers and grants into a more supple and real-time practice where the production of science involves both professionals and citizen scientists blending, and co-creating a publicly available shared knowledge. Michael Nielsen , author of the 2012 book Reinventing Discovery: The New Era of Networked Science (Nielsen 2012) describes open science, less as a set of specific practices, but ultimately as a process to amplify collective intelligence to solve scientific problems more easily: To amplify collective intelligence, we should scale up collaborations, increasing the cognitive diversity and range of available expertise as much as possible. This broadens the range of problems that can be easy solved … Ideally, the collaboration will achieve designed serendipity, so that a problem that seems hard to the person posing it finds its way to a person with just the right microexpertise to easily solve it. Attempts to reform the way we do science have been underway for decades, from arXiv in the 1990s (Ginsparg 2011), to open access publishing in the early 2000s (Suber 2002). The degree to which any scientific field practices open science varies considerably, but it's pretty fair to say that the institutional embracement of open science hasn't exactly been speedy despite demonstrated successes in the physical sciences and mathematics such as the Polymath project (Cranshaw and Kittur 2011) and Galaxy Zoo (Lintott et al. 2008). In physics it is had been mainstream for a while now to release manuscripts first on arXiv (Ginsparg 2011). There are new resources in the astronomy community for uploading, maintaining and curating raw data on exoplanets (Rein 2012) and supernovae (Guillochon, Parrent, and Margutti 2016). In the biomedical sciences, progress has been considerably slower, perhaps due its larger institutional and financial footprint: it's the proverbial large supertanker that needs a long time to turn around, let alone move in different direction. Whatever the reason, open science is now firmly on the radar, and it has unleashed a torrent of opinion and criticism, examining all aspects from its practicality to its desirability.",2717909992,Alexander Lancaster

Central to this are complex processes of delegation - in which organizational work and agency are passed back and forth across the shifting line between ''social'' and ''technical'' elements. Building on work in the sociology of science, this paper extends the concept of delegation and applies it to thorny questions around the work of sustaining organization over time. We explore two examples from the Open Science Grid (OSG), an initiative that distributes computational resources to geographically dispersed and otherwise loosely coordinated research teams. Our first case is one of successful delegation, as automated access to resources is extended to a new group of distributed scientists. We then turn our attention to a case where the process of delegation breaks down, revealing the usually invisible work needed to sustain ''seamless'' integration. As these cases show, delegation is complex, fragile, and central to the nature of contemporary organizing. Specifically, delegation: 1) reconfigures the organization of work; 2) transforms how outcomes are accomplished; 3) redistributes responsibility for organizational decision-making; and 4) shifts the visibility and invisibility of both actors and their work.",1993483599; 2307424608; 2248465365; 2504553097; 671788600,David Ribes; Steven J.

To serve users better, last year the front end was completely overhauled with its main aim in crowdsourcing features, e.g., by giving end-users the opportunity to create digital clippings and a personal scrapbook from the digital collections. But how can you know whether crowdsourcing has had an impact? How much crowdsourcing functionalities have been used so far? Did crowdsourcing work? In this paper the statistics and metrics of a recent crowdsourcing effort are analysed across the different digitized material types (newspapers, journals, ephemera). The subjects, categories and keywords given by the users are analysed to see which topics are the most appealing. Some notable public uses of the crowdsourced article clippings are highlighted. These metrics give us indications on how the end-users, based on their own interests, are investigating and using the digital collections. Therefore, the suggested metrics illustrate the versatility of the information needs of the users, varying from citizen science to research purposes. By analysing the user patterns, we can respond to the new needs of the users by making minor changes to accommodate the most active participants, while still making the service more approachable for those who are trying out the functionalities for the first time. Participation in the clippings and annotations can enrich the materials in unexpected ways and can possibly pave the way for opportunities of using crowdsourcing more also in research contexts. This creates more opportunities for the goals of open science since source data becomes ­available, making it possible for researchers to reach out to the general public for help. In the long term, utilizing, for example, text mining methods can allow these different end-user segments to achieve more. Based on our current initial experiences, we feel that crowdsourcing gives an opportunity for a library context to get closer to the user base and to obtain insight into the numerous opportunities, which the digitized content provides for them and for the library. Gathering the first prototype qualitative and quantitative metrics for this particular crowdsourcing case gives information on how to further improve both the service and the metrics so that they can give valid information for decision-making.",2697605263,Tuula Pääkkönen

In order to better serve this community, Fermilab has placed its production computer resources in a Campus Grid infrastructure called 'FermiGrid'. The FermiGrid infrastructure allows the large experiments at Fermilab to have priority access to their own resources, enables sharing of these resources in an opportunistic fashion, and movement of work (jobs, data) between the Campus Grid and National Grids such as Open Science Grid (OSG) and the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid Collaboration (WLCG). FermiGrid resources support multiple Virtual Organizations (VOs), including VOs from the OSG, EGEE, and the WLCG. Fermilab also makes leading contributions to the Open Science Grid in the areas of accounting, batch computing, grid security, job management, resource selection, site infrastructure, storage management, and VO services. Through the FermiGrid interfaces, authenticated and authorized VOs and individuals may access our core grid services, the 10,000+ Fermilab resident CPUs, near-petabyte (including CMS) online disk pools and the multi-petabyte Fermilab Mass Storage System. These core grid services include a site wide Globus gatekeeper, VO management services for several VOs, Fermilab site authorization services, grid user mapping services, as well as job accounting and monitoring, resource selection and data movement services. Access to these services is via standard and well-supported grid interfaces. We will report on the user experience of using the FermiGrid campus infrastructure interfaced to a national cyberinfrastructure - the successes and the problems.",2126148120; 2697804871; 2764948817; 2679245483; 2764854450; 2015623578; 25894833; 2091181715; 2685692233; 2714839988; 2286898990,Keith Chadwick; S Timm; D R Yocum; E Berman; P Canal; T.

Accordingly it has entered guidelines and has been approved for clinical use by authorities. However, there remains a controversy regarding aspects of the PLATO trial, which are not immediately apparent from the peer-reviewed publications. A number of publications have sought to highlight potential discrepancies, using data available in publicly published documents from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) leading to disagreement regarding the value of open science and data sharing.

The job requirements have undergone change tremendously. The emergence of e-culture, e-education, e-governance, e-training, e-work sites and so on questioned the capacity of conventional face to face education in catering to all and relevance of existing job related skills to a great extent in the emerging global society. Today, every one has to update his/her educational and/or professional skills and competencies to cope up with the emerging work challenges. This is more so in the field of science and technology. At the same time, it is impossible to cater to educational and training opportunities to one and all those who aspire for it through the conventional set up. The distance and open learning (ODL) seems to be one of the viable alternatives. Today, the success and viability of ODL is accepted globally. Coulter (1989), through a study demonstrated that ODL is a costeffective medium in providing educational opportunities. Similarly Holmberg (1981) also mentioned ODL as a systematic teaching-learning medium by using variety of medium for imparting learning. The present study is an attempt to study the experiences of the open science learners of IGNOU on different aspect of the science higher education. Here a questionnaire was used to collect the data and responses from 81 students enrolled for B. Sc. from IGNOU were collected. The findings of the study reported that society has undergone drastic changes in the last few decades. The revolution led due to Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have widely affected all aspects of society. The emerging jobs require entirely new skills and competencies i.e., employment in BPOs or switching over to e-governance, e-Banking and e- based sectors. Even e-learning has made numerous expectations from teachers and other personnel. The use of ICTs in almost every field needs adequately trained workers so that they can work efficiently and effectively. The training and retraining avenues in the conventional system is grossly inadequate to cope up with the present and future demands. In this situation open and distance education is the available alternative.",2685319946; 2686776780,Amrita Nigam; Vibha Joshi

However, it also poses challenges to users and developers in terms of running and maintaining HPC applications which is low-level and complex for scientists. This impacts reusability and reproducibility of the work and increases the cost of development and maintenance. N3phele is a cloud-based workbench that allows researchers to perform complex analysis using only browser and resources in infrastructure clouds, which are orchestrated by n3phele. Individual scientists may publish tools and workflow pipelines, registering them in n3phele for their own private or public collaborator use. To illustrate, the QIIME microbial community analysis toolkit has been registered into n3phele, and n3phele used to perform microbial analysis, including computationally intensive Roche 454 denoising, using Amazon EC2 and n3phele's point and click interface. N3phele substantially improves usability and manageability of complex scientific analysis pipelines in the cloud.",2165327183; 255653866; 2399284272; 2653175734,Nigel Cook; Dejan S.

We demonstrate different ways that greater transparency of the research process in our field will accelerate scientific progress by increasing accuracy of reported research findings. Importantly, we make concrete recommendations for how relationship researchers can transition to greater disclosure of research practices in a manner that is sensitive to the unique design features of methodologies employed by relationship scientists. We discuss how to implement these recommendations for four different research designs regularly used in relationship research and practical limitations regarding implementing our recommendations and provide potential solutions to these problems.",2640133301; 2039053016; 2777045847,Lorne Campbell; Timothy J.

Organized as a global community with nonprofit offices in several U.S. states, Public Lab introduces a model of community science, which incorporates open source practices including transparent collaboration and iterative design, along with deliberative democratic governance, and practitioner empowerment through critical making supported by an open science network. Community science can enable community members to collect, interpret, and apply their own data to effect local change or participate in broader environmental research and decision-making. The authors conceptualize a tiered approach to project development, with tiers delineated by the scope of community objectives and the role of community science in achieving those objectives. Tier 1 includes performative science used to engage the public but without direct application toward community goals. Tier 2 involves community science created and conducted by members for community-relevant outcomes. Tier 3 incorporates institutional partners, building upon community data through collaborative process to achieve community goals with broader implications. Examples of Public Lab projects from each tier demonstrate the versatility of community science, and the potential opportunity for community science to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making on multiple levels.

The H2020 project OpenUP aspires to bring all these stakeholders into an open dialogue to consensually identify and spread the review-disseminate-assess mechanisms advancing evolving practices of RRI in an Open Science context. OpenUP will actively engage research communities and implement a series of hands-on pilots to validate OpenUP’s proposed (open) peer review, innovative dissemination, and impact indicator frameworks. The pilots will be carried out in close cooperation with selected, devoted research communities from four scientific areas: arts and humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and energy. This poster visualises UpenUP’s pilot design exemplified by two of the seven Open Science Pilots to be conducted by the project: 1) Open Peer Review for Conferences, and 2) Addressing and Reaching Businesses and the Public with Research Output. The first pilot will evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of open peer reviewing in a conference setting. The specific implementation of the applied schema will be determined by the results from the state of the art study as well as the user questionnaire answers from other work packages of OpenUP. In comparison to the traditional way (double-blind evaluation of submitted papers by assigned reviewers chosen by the conference organisers) the new schema should allow for a more open and fair process as well as give additional incentives to reviewers. The actual pilot study will be conducted at a medium sized conference in consultation with the conference organisers. Follow-up questionnaires and interviews will show if the stakeholders preferred the new process and can provide constructive feedback for improvements and policy decisions. The second pilot will test existing and potential alternative forms, formats, and channels of open science communication, and explore how the targeted audiences, in particular businesses and the public, can be best reached via these channels. In a preparatory phase the team will map open science communication formats/channels and their targeted audiences. The team will conduct a workshop to elicit the targeted stakeholders’ requirements and expectations towards a useful and appealing communication of scientific contents. This will be the basis of the second pilot presented here. It will actively involve one or more energy research community projects beyond the OpenUP consortium. The goals are to test the previously established communication standards and channels for the energy area, and evaluate the impact and resonance at the targeted audiences. By actively involving research communities and other relevant stakeholders into the pilots, OpenUP will not only evaluate the practicability of the identified open peer review, innovative dissemination, and impact measurement methods in particular settings. It also intends to create and disseminate success stories, best/good practices, and policy recommendations, which will help further communities to implement working Open Science approaches in their research evaluation and communication strategies.",2484585712; 275120218; 2537222294,Michela Vignoli; Oliver Zendel; Matthias Schörghuber

The keynote includes recent empirical results and recommendations for good practice and further research. In particular, the paper is based on an assessment of 864 print and electronic dissertations in sciences, social sciences and humanities from the Universities of Lille (France) and Ljubljana (Slovenia), submitted between 1987 and 2015, and on a survey on data management with 270 scientists in social sciences and humanities of the University of Lille 3.
The keynote starts with an introduction into data-driven science, data life cycle and data publishing. It then moves on to research data management by PhD students, their practice, their needs and their willingness to disseminate and share their data. After this qualitative analysis of information behaviour, we present the results of a quantitative assessment of research data produced and submitted with dissertations Special attention is paid to the size of the research data in appendices, to their presentation and link to the text, to their sources and typology, and to their potential for further research. The discussion puts the focus on legal aspects (database protection, intellectual property, privacy, third-party rights) and other barriers to data sharing, reuse and dissemination through open access.
Another part adds insight into the potential handling of these data, in the framework of the French and Slovenian dissertation infrastructures. What could be done to valorise these data in a centralized system for electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs)? The topics are formats, metadata (including attribution of unique identifiers), submission/deposit, long-term preservation and dissemination. This part will also draw on experiences from other campuses and make use of results from surveys on data management at the Universities of Berlin and Lille.
The conclusion provides some recommendations for the assistance and advice to PhD students in managing and depositing their research data, and also for further research.
Our study will be helpful for academic libraries to develop assistance and advice for PhD students in managing their research data, in collaboration with the research structures and the graduate schools. Moreover, it should be helpful to prepare and select research data for long-term preservation, curate research data in open repositories and design data repositories.
The French part of paper is part of an ongoing research project at the University of Lille 3 (France) in the field of digital humanities and research data, conducted with scientists and academic librarians. Its preliminary results have been presented at a conference on research data in February 2015 at Lille, at the 8th Conference on Grey Literature and Repositories at Prague in October 2015 and published in the Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication. The Slovenian research results have not been published before.",2698002689; 2553701144; 2009713239; 2196773147; 2786107886; 2779112762,Joachim Schöpfel; Južnič Primož; Hélène Prost; Cécile Malleret; Ana Češarek; Teja Koler-Povh

The transition to a more far-reaching OA and Open Science is often very much dependent on services and on an infrastructure embedded in workflows to deliver on policy. However, the sustainability of Open Access or Open Science services is often a long way from being assured. A relatively new global coalition called SCOSS will enable the international research community, through its institutions and funding organisations, to take responsibility for sustaining those services. It will do this by providing a new co-ordinated cost-sharing framework to ensure that non-commercial OS services that underpin the development of wider global Open Access and Open Science are sustained in the future. The SCOSS group makes recommendations on what to fund and why based on a rigorous evaluation procedure where services are invited to apply and provide extensive information to the SCOSS group. Applicants provide information on the service’s value to communities such as funders, universities, libraries, authors, research managers, repositories, etc.; information on the governance structure, the technical solution, costs, sustainability measures, and their plans for the future. SCOSS is currently in the middle of a pilot to test the concept. Current SCOSS members include the Australasian Open Access Strategy Group (AOASG), the Council of the Australian University Librarians (CAUL), LIBER, EIFL and SPARC Europe with other organisations following the pilot and advising such as the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR), the European Research Council (ERC), the European University Association (EUA), and others. This presentation will outline the Terms of Reference of the coalition, the case, the SCOSS governance structure, experience with the pilot and challenges to date. This session is of interest to those who are interested in helping the user community to sustain an Open Access and Open Science infrastructure to help implement policy goals, and finding out how they can contribute to making that happen.",2768024350,Vanessa Proudman

The concepts of Science 2.0 and Open Science will be introduced. As such we provide a short introduction to the history of science and knowledge dissemination. We explain the origins of our scientific culture which evolved around publication methods. Interdependencies of current concepts will be elucidated and it will be stated that the transition towards Open Science is a complex cultural change. Reasons as to why the change is slow are discussed and the main obstacles are identified. Next, we explain the recent changes in scientific workflows and how these cause changes in the system as a whole. Furthermore, we provide an overview on the entire book and explain what can be found in each chapter. Nicole Forster's goal as a researcher is to enhance cancer treatment. That is why she and her colleagues in the laboratory of Leif W. Ellisen at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston, Massachusetts, study tumors on indi- vidual levels and search for cancer causes. In March 2012 Forster was trying to isolate ribonucleic acid (RNA)—the genetic blueprint for proteins within the cell—within mouse cells. To prepare the cells for her experiment she mixed them with a special gel that provided them with all the nutrients to grow and proliferate, even outside the body, for a short period of time. Yet in the following step, she had to get rid of the gel to get to the information she needed: the RNA. And therein lay",2440821721; 2720754638,Sönke Bartling; Sascha Friesike

We discuss the benefits found in moving to a community standard, including the abilities to reuse existing packaging, to donate existing packaging back to the community, and to leverage existing skills in the community. We describe our approach to testing in which we test our software against multiple versions of the OS, including pre-releases of the OS, in order to find surprises before our users do.

Open Science is a broad movement looking beyond Open Access to publish openly and share scientific research immediately. Accessibility is addressed on all levels for everyone, without fees.

Open Science not only deals with Open Access papers but scientific research results in general, including figures, data, models, algorithms, software, tools, notebooks, laboratory designs, recipes, samples and much more. Furthermore, it covers the communication, review, and discussion of research results and considers changing needs regarding incentives, quality assessment, metrics, impact, reputation, grants and funding. Thus Open Science encompasses licensing, policy-making, infrastructures and scientific heritage while safeguarding the dynamic nature of science and its evolving forms.

However, this short course is meant not to carry too far with Open Science. Rather, it looks at what is possible nowadays and what is ready for application in geosciences. The speakers present open data solutions and introduce networks. It is aimed to create an idea on how researchers benefit from Open Science regarding research data. Both the drawbacks and opportunities of open data are outlined.

This short course is the first part of the Short Course series 'Open Science goes Geo'. Part I covers research data and its role in the scientific work. The possibilities for publishing research data leveraging Open Science in geosciences are addressed, together with related opportunities and stumbling blocks. Moreover, the ways in which networks can support scientific collaboration on shared datasets are introduced.

The short course will close with a mini panel discussion to gear follow-up discussions.",2707906650,Hans Pfeiffenberger

The theme of the Workshop was: Establishing good practice in research data management in European universities. The Workshop was divided into three sections: (1) an explanation of the role of research data management in the research process and an identification that the ‘data deluge’ is pivotal in shaping the future of research practice. The presentation then analyses the LERU Roadmap for research data, which is the first report of its kind to identify what universities and their researchers have to do to deliver good practice in research data management; (2) A practical study of what universities, and their libraries, can do to deliver good research data management practice. The presentation looks at a practical example of research data management in the Arts and Humanities, examines the importance of the Hague Declaration (2015), looks at the potential of the EU-funded LEARN project, uses the 10 LIBER recommendations to libraries as a key self-assessment tool in research data management, and marks the author’s host institution UCL against the LIBER Roadmap; (3) The final presentation sets the concept of research data management in the context of Open Science (Science 2.0). It looks at LERU’s submission to the European Commission’s Science 2.0 consultation, analyses the main findings of the consultation in terms of Open Access, and posits a new role for the institution as an Open Access publisher, with publishing being based in the Library. It then looks at further concepts of Open Science – Research Evaluation and Citizen Science. Finally, the presentation places research data management at the heart of the Open Science agenda, and suggests that this presents a transformative opportunity for University Libraries in the 21st century.",2689939994,P Ayris

Journal coordinated peer reviewing, a hallmark of scholarly publishing, is also a pivotal part of other central academic processes, such as evaluation of research grant applications, and ranking of applicants for faculty/research positions. Hence, journal coordinated peer reviewing may be viewed as “the mother of academic peer reviewing”. On this background, it is astonishing that universities and other public RD iii) better control of how scientific staff use their time for the good of the university; iv) managing a unified policy shaping of peer reviewing, reducing fraud and flaws. This will in turn increase quality of the research produced by the universities.     The EU has recently announced their goal of making all European scientific articles freely accessible by 2020. This announcement was made unanimously by the EU ministers responsible for research and innovation. The ministers have not announced what means to use in achieving their announced goal. We suggest a united approach whereby taking control of the peer review job could be an interesting road to follow. Such a unified international action among universities and grant agencies would be very beneficial in order to make the changes needed to establish peer reviewing as a truly academically based responsibility. The increasing international agreements and actions to implement open access publishing are indications that such changes are possible. By standing together universities will be able to break the economic grip that the big commercial publishing houses have on academic research. Some may argue that it is the right of each individual scientist to decide on the extent and for what journal to perform peer reviewing. However, if an employer for some reason limits the amount of time used to do peer reviewing for certain commercial publishing houses, it would not interfere with the academic freedom to do research and to choose freely where and how to publish. After all, work contracts include instructions on how to perform a certain amount of teaching, administration and research. The option of directing where to do or not to do peer review should not be very controversial. By taking control of and organizing peer reviewing universities would obtain a means to regain the academic freedom that was lost when commercial enterprises took over the society driven journals, introducing heavy paywalls. And it may facilitate a development towards an open science regime.",733350910; 1256840701; 71241299; 2779758045,Bård Smedsrød; Eirik Reierth; Lars Moksness; Leif Longva

Liberal feminism called for womens rights equal education pay and opportunity that provided them to make it in a mans world. However this has also led into certain blind alleys such as the tendency to: ignore or altogether deny sex and gender differences and the search for womens distinctive research methods. Feminists started developing the following three basic tenets of so called ""difference feminism"". First difference feminism diverged from liberalism in focusing on the differences between men and women. Second it also revalued qualities traditionally devalued as feminine such as subjectivity cooperation empathy and the likes. And finally it was argued that changes not only in women but also in science classrooms curricula laboratories theories priorities and research programs are needed for women to become equal in science. Feminism has brought impressive changes to science. Two examples are from the US where gender studies have had a massive impact on the content of science are medicine and primatology. However the question of who or what might create beneficial change in science has been confused by Americans mistrust in feminism. Moreover to test whether women or feminism will do or have done science differently would require a complex study of the history of science. Understanding the process of change can enhance efforts to open science to women throughout the world.",2031361785,Londa Schiebinger

It shows their benefits to both scientists and researchers and to users. To the first ones insofar as they enjoy autonomy in relation to the editors, more visibility of their scientific production and an increase in the citation number of their researches. To the scientific community in general, the benefits should be seen as a large access to the science and technology literature without costs or restrictions. The terminology studied covers, besides the two central terms – the green road and the golden road – self-archiving, scientific data, digital curation, enhanced publications, among others. In the political setting some international and Brazilian manifestos as that from IBICT are mentioned. Their actions to support and encourage open access to scientific information are described and configured as a space to discussion and production of research about these issues. With the application of this new paradigm, the limits or boundaries between the knowledge generated by S&T and the people who need that knowledge based on the researches are overcome and become unlimited.",2692684722,Lena Vania Ribeiro Pinheiro

The OSG project[1] is funded by the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy Scientific Discovery through Advanced Computing program. The OSG project provides specific activities for the operation and evolution of the common infrastructure. The US ATLAS and US CMS collaborations contribute to and depend on OSG as the US infrastructure contributing to the World Wide LHC Computing Grid on which the LHC experiments distribute and analyze their data. Other stakeholders include the STAR RHIC experiment, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and several Fermilab Tevatron experiments- CDF, D0, MiniBoone etc. The OSG implementation architecture brings a pragmatic approach to enabling vertically integrated community specific distributed systems over a common horizontal set of shared resources and services.

Swarming is an experiment in self-organizing and a novel way to collaborate in the field of academic research. Open research swarms utilize the possibilities of Internet, especially the social media tools that are now available because of the web 2.0 boom. The main goal is to collectively attain rapid solutions to given challenges and to develop a distributed intellectual milieu for researchers.

Experimentalists use computation for data analysis, processing ever bigger data sets. Theoreticians compute predictions from ever more complex models. However, traditional articles do not permit the publication of big data sets or complex models. As a consequence, these crucial pieces of information no longer enter the scientific record. Moreover, they have become prisoners of scientific software: many models exist only as software implementations, and the data are often stored in proprietary formats defined by the software. In this article, I argue that this emphasis on software tools over models and data is detrimental to science in the long term, and I propose a means by which this can be reversed.",306386534,Konrad Hinsen

The fieldwork and study underlying the report were undertaken by InformAll CIC during the first half of 2017, on the basis of interviews with experts from a range of organisations that run federated infrastructures in the respective countries.

The report reaches nine broad conclusions. It first considers the issues and background to the study, then the methodology deployed, before synthesising and analysing the information gathered during the fieldwork. This information is structured to address the following: what is understood by ‘federated’; drivers for FRDIs (push factors and meeting demand); operation of the infrastructures; data-related practices; training and skills; challenges and obstacles; outcomes and impact; and implications for the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC).",2771962249,Stephane Goldstein

HIRMEOS, H igh I ntegration of R esearch M onographs in the E uropean O pen S cience infrastructure, is a 30-month EU-funded project and tackles the main obstacles of the full integration of important platforms supporting open access monographs and their contents. HIRMEOS will work on innovative services on identification, entities recognition, annotation, and altmetrics, using when possible common standards. These standards are well established in journal publishing, however not common enough yet in book publishing to pave the way for deeper linking of book and journal content or crosslinking of references, entities or usage. HIRMEOS is based upon 5 Open Access book-publishing platforms, OpenEdition Books, OAPEN Library, EKT Open Book Press, Ubiquity Press and Gottingen University Press. During the run of the project these platforms integrate tools for identification, authentication and interoperability (DOI, ORCID, Fundref), for additional information and entity extraction (INRIA (N)ERD), the ability to annotate monographs (Hypothes.is), and gather usage and alternative metric data. HIRMEOS will also enrich the technical capacities of the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB), a most significant indexing service for open access monographs globally, to receive automated information for ingestion, while it will also develop a structured certification system to document monograph peer-review.  The project consortium will develop shared minimum standards for their monograph publications, such that allow the full embedding of technologies and content in the European Science Cloud. Finally, the project will have a catalyst effect in including more disciplines into the Open Science paradigm, widening its boundaries towards the SSH. The poster will give facts and figures about the involved platforms and their catalogues, the types of services to be implemented and the used standards, the expected benefit for the Social Sciences and Humanities players the global benefits for the Open Science environment",2770890773,Andrea Bertino

A major boost is required if these initiatives are to be coordinated and the great ambition realised. That is why this Plan lists the ambitions and provides details of the parties intending to take action, as well as the timeframes within which they believe they can realise their objectives. The key ambitions are: (1) Full open access to publications in 2020: Continue the Dutch approach for all Dutch research organisations and research areas whilst recognising their differences and similarities; (2) To make research data optimally suited for reuse: To set clear and agreed technical and policy-related preconditions to facilitate reuse of research data, including provision of the necessary expertise and support; (3) Recognition and rewards: To examine together how open science can be an element of the evaluation and reward system for researchers, research groups and research proposals; and (4) To promote and support: To establish a ‘clearing house’ for all information regarding all available research support. With the ambitions set out in this plan the Netherlands is responding to the Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science published in 2016, the conclusions of the Competitiveness Council in May 2016, and to the in the letter to Parliament concerning open science confirmed question by the State Secretary for Education, Culture and Science (January 2017). Open access to publications and optimal reuse of research data are becoming the standard for all knowledge institutes and research areas. The motto here is as open as possible, as closed as necessary.",2118273191; 2596634888; 2596342783; 2754989676,W.J.S.M. Van Wezenbeek; H.J.J. Touwen; A.M.C. Versteeg; Astrid van Wesenbeeck

There are three main actors called to deal with research data publishing practices: researchers, publishers, and data repositories. This study analyses the solutions offered by generalist scientific data repositories, i.e., repositories supporting the deposition of any type of research data. These repositories cannot make any assumption on the application domain. They are actually called to face with the almost open ended typologies of data used in science. The current practices promoted by such repositories are analysed with respect to eight key aspects of data publishing, i.e., dataset formatting, documentation, licensing, publication costs, validation, availability, discovery and access, and citation. From this analysis it emerges that these repositories implement well consolidated practices and pragmatic solutions for literature repositories. These practices and solutions can not totally meet the needs of management and use of datasets resources, especially in a context where rapid technological changes continuously open new exploitation prospects.",2038068201; 2133557673; 2072114465; 2113923003,Massimiliano Assante; Leonardo Candela; Donatella Castelli; Alice Tani

For scientific software, however, this is less often the case. Most scientific software is written by only a few authors, often a student working on a thesis. Once the paper describing the tool has been published, the tool is no longer developed further and is left to its own device. Here we describe the broad, multidisciplinary community we formed around a set of tools for statistical genomics. The GenABEL project for statistical omics actively promotes open interdisciplinary development of statistical methodology and its implementation in efficient and user-friendly software under an open source licence. The software tools developed withing the project collectively make up the GenABEL suite, which currently consists of eleven tools. The open framework of the project actively encourages involvement of the community in all stages, from formulation of methodological ideas to application of software to specific data sets. A web forum is used to channel user questions and discussions, further promoting the use of the GenABEL suite. Developer discussions take place on a dedicated mailing list, and development is further supported by robust development practices including use of public version control, code review and continuous integration. Use of this open science model attracts contributions from users and developers outside the ""core team"", facilitating agile statistical omics methodology development and fast dissemination.",865189202; 1901246291; 2029140536,Lennart C.

The new altmetrics introduced in 2010 as "" new, online scholarly tools (that allow) to make new filters "" (Altmetrics Manifesto), can include all kinds of scholarly output which makes them interesting for grey literature. The topic of our paper is the connection between altmetrics and grey literature. Do altmetrics offer new opportunities for the development and impact of grey literature? In particular, the paper explores how altmetrics could add value to grey literature, in particular how reference managers, repositories, academic search engines and social networks can produce altmetrics of dissertations, reports, conference papers etc. We explore, too, how new altmetric tools incorporate grey literature as source for impact assessment, and if they do. The discussion analyses the potential but also the limits of the actual application of altmetrics to grey literatures and highlights the importance of unique identifiers, above all the DOI. For the moment, grey literature missed the opportunity to get on board of the new movement. However, getting grey literature into the heart of the coming mainstream adoption of altmetrics is not only essential for the future of grey literature in open science but also for academic and institutional control of research output and societal impact. This can be a special mission for academic librarians.",102885235; 2009713239,Joachim Schöpfel; Hélène Prost

Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad-scope, open access journals that take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. This model is often said to support the broader goals of the open science movement. Based on in-depth interviews with 31 publishers and editors representing 16 different organizations (10 of which publish a megajournal), this paper reports how the term ‘megajournal’ is understood and publishers’ rationale and motivations for launching (or not launching) an OAMJ. We find that while there is general agreement on the common characteristics of megajournals, there is not yet a consensus on their relative importance. We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits. These results suggest that the often polarized debate surrounding OAMJs is a consequence of the extent to which observers perceive publishers to be motivated by these societal or business benefits.",2063328998; 207261885; 2116253019; 2098208818; 683442028; 2191278634,Simon Wakeling; Valerie C.L.

Unfortunately, this goal has not yet been accomplished. Despite progress in obtaining quality scientific articles in Latin America, it remains difficult to reliably access new and cutting-edge research. As graduating Peruvian medical students, we have confronted many obstacles in obtaining access to quality and up-to-date information and a constant tension between accessing ""what is available"" rather than ""what we need"". As we have learned, these limitations affect not only our own education but also the choices we make in the management of our patients.

These technologies complement formal means of sharing knowledge via conferences and published papers, where it is impossible to share all the research details, and where negative results are rarely included. A small but growing number of scientists and researchers are beginning to harness these Web 2.0 technologies as a transformative way of doing science. With the advent of Service Oriented Architectures, the model of chaining services to create analysis workflows provides the research community unprecedented opportunity to collaborate, sharing their workflows with one another, reproducing and analyzing research results, and leveraging colleagues' expertise to expedite the process of scientific knowledge discovery. A crucial component needed for this unprecedented level of cooperation within the research community is a reusable, extensible and customizable environment for building collaborative “open science” portals for managing these shared analysis workflows.

Acknowledging this elicits the key questions: where are we? Where are we headed? What, if anything, can be done about this? And what can the “economics of science” contribute to this? This paper assumes a “cultural political economy of research & innovation” (CPERI) perspective to explore the current upheaval and transition in the system of academic knowledge production, at the confluence of accelerating commercialisation and the seemingly opposing movement of “open science.” This perspective affords a characterisation of the core of the current crises as a crisis of moral economy; an issue to which a political economy of epistemic authority is in turn crucial. A “remoralizing” of knowledge production is thus a matter of key systemic importance, though it is important to understand such developments in power-strategic, and not explicitly moral, terms. Much of the current moves towards “open science” and “massively open online courses” (MOOCs) can also then be seen as self-defeating developments that simply exacerbate the crisis of a viable “economy of science” and in no sense its solution. Their lasting significance, however, is more likely to lie precisely in their effects on the construction of a new moral economy of knowledge production.",2081393523,David Tyfield

In an education setting, this social media tool has potential to increase active learning opportunities, and increase student engagement with course content. The effects of Twitter on learning dynamics was tested in a field biology course offered by a large Canadian University: 29 students agreed to take part in the Twitter project and quantitative and qualitative data were collected, including survey data from 18 students. Students published 200% more public Tweets than what was required, and interacted frequently with the instructor and teaching assistant, their peers, and users external to the course. Almost 80% of students stated that Twitter increased opportunities for among-group communication, and 94% of students felt this kind of collaborative communication was beneficial to their learning. Although students did not think they would use Twitter after the course was over, 77% of the students still felt it was a good learning tool, and 67% of students felt Twitter had a positive impact on how they engaged with course content. These results suggest social media tools such as Twitter can help achieve active and collaborative learning in higher education.",1532503542; 74117086,Lauren Soluk; Christopher M. Buddle

A survey of policies at major research funders found that there is room for more transparency in the process of grant review, which would strengthen the case for the efficiency of public spending on research. On that basis, debate was invited on which transparency measures should be implemented and how, with some concrete suggestions at hand. The present article adds to this discussion by providing further context from the literature, along with considerations on the effect size of the proposed measures. The article then explores the option of opening to the public key components of the process, makes the case for pilot projects in this area, and sketches out the potential that such measures might have to transform the research landscape in those areas in which they are implemented.",137719847,Daniel Mietchen

Although the digital revolution has facilitated and accelerated the publishing process by moving from print to online, it has not changed the scientific journal and scholarly communication as such. Today publications and citations in peer-reviewed journals are considered as indicators of scientific productivity and impact and used and misused in research evaluation. As scholarly communication is becoming more open and diverse and manuscripts, data, presentations and code are shared online, the altmetrics and open science movement demand the adaption of evaluation practices.

The purpose of this paper is threefold: to focus on the process of multilingual concept scheme construction and the challenges involved; to addresses concrete challenges faced in the construction process and especially those related to equivalence between terms and concepts; and to briefly outlines the translation strategies developed during the process of concept scheme construction.




Design/methodology/approach




The analysis is based on experience acquired during the establishment of the Finnish thesaurus and ontology service Finto as well as the trilingual General Finnish Ontology YSO, both of which are being maintained and further developed at the National Library of Finland.




Findings




Although uniform resource identifiers can be considered language-independent, they do not render concept schemes and their construction free of language-related challenges. The fundamental issue with all the challenges faced is how to maintain consistency and predictability when the nature of language requires each concept to be treated individually. The key to such challenges is to recognise the function of the vocabulary and the needs of its intended users.




Social implications




Open science increases the transparency of not only research products, but also metadata tools. Gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in their construction is important for a great variety of users – e.g. indexers, vocabulary builders and information seekers. Today, multilingualism is an essential aspect at both the national and international information society level.




Originality/value




This paper draws on the practical challenges faced in concept scheme construction in a trilingual environment, with a focus on “concept scheme” as a translation and mapping unit.",1863869839; 2692729953; 2308138217,Satu Niininen; Susanna Nykyri; Osma Suominen

There are many reasons researchers do not open their data, and one is technical. It is often time consuming to prepare and archive data. In response, my laboratory has automated the process such that our data are archived the night they are created without any human approval or action. All data are versioned, logged, time stamped, and uploaded including aborted runs and data from pilot subjects. The archive is GitHub, github.com, the world’s largest collection of open-source materials. Data archived in this manner are called born open. In this paper, I discuss the benefits of born-open data and provide a brief technical overview of the process.

However, in the years following the release of DSM-5, an expanding body of research has increasingly classified engagement in a wide range of common behaviours and leisure activities as possible behavioural addiction. If this expansion does not end, both the relevance and the credibility of the field of addictive disorders might be questioned, which may prompt a dismissive appraisal of the new DSM-5 subcategory for behavioural addiction. We propose an operational definition of behavioural addiction together with a number of exclusion criteria, to avoid pathologizing common behaviours and provide a common ground for further research. The definition and its exclusion criteria are clarified and justified by illustrating how these address a number of theoretical and methodological shortcomings that result from existing conceptualizations. We invite other researchers to extend our definition under an Open Science Foundation framework.",2014707872,Mark D. Griffiths

The keynote includes recent empirical results and recommendations for good practice and further research. In particular, the paper is based on an assessment of 864 print and electronic dissertations in sciences, social sciences and humanities from the Universities of Lille (France) and Ljubljana (Slovenia), submitted between 1987 and 2015, and on a survey on data management with 270 scientists in social sciences and humanities of the University of Lille 3.
The keynote starts with an introduction into data-driven science, data life cycle and data publishing. It then moves on to research data management by PhD students, their practice, their needs and their willingness to disseminate and share their data. After this qualitative analysis of information behaviour, we present the results of a quantitative assessment of research data produced and submitted with dissertations Special attention is paid to the size of the research data in appendices, to their presentation and link to the text, to their sources and typology, and to their potential for further research. The discussion puts the focus on legal aspects (database protection, intellectual property, privacy, third-party rights) and other barriers to data sharing, reuse and dissemination through open access.
Another part adds insight into the potential handling of these data, in the framework of the French and Slovenian dissertation infrastructures. What could be done to valorise these data in a centralized system for electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs)? The topics are formats, metadata (including attribution of unique identifiers), submission/deposit, long-term preservation and dissemination. This part will also draw on experiences from other campuses and make use of results from surveys on data management at the Universities of Berlin and Lille.
The conclusion provides some recommendations for the assistance and advice to PhD students in managing and depositing their research data, and also for further research.
Our study will be helpful for academic libraries to develop assistance and advice for PhD students in managing their research data, in collaboration with the research structures and the graduate schools. Moreover, it should be helpful to prepare and select research data for long-term preservation, curate research data in open repositories and design data repositories.
The French part of paper is part of an ongoing research project at the University of Lille 3 (France) in the field of digital humanities and research data, conducted with scientists and academic librarians. Its preliminary results have been presented at a conference on research data in February 2015 at Lille, at the 8th Conference on Grey Literature and Repositories at Prague in October 2015 and published in the Journal of Librarianship and Scholarly Communication. The Slovenian research results have not been published before.",102885235; 320156121; 2009713239; 2196773147; 2298191616; 208048229,Joachim Schöpfel; Primož Južnič; Hélène Prost; Cécile Malleret; Ana Češarek; Teja Koler-Povh

One area where big, open data is particularly valuable is in research relating to complex heterogeneous disorders such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The inconsistencies of findings and the great heterogeneity of ASD necessitate the use of big and open data to tackle important challenges such as understanding and defining the heterogeneity and potential subtypes of ASD. To this end, a number of initiatives have been established that aim to develop big and/or open data resources for autism research. In order to provide a useful data reference for autism researchers, a systematic search for ASD data resources was conducted using the Scopus database, the Google search engine, and the pages on 'recommended repositories' by key journals, and the findings were translated into a comprehensive list focused on ASD data. The aim of this review is to systematically search for all available ASD data resources providing the following data types: phenotypic, neuroimaging, human brain connectivity matrices, human brain statistical maps, biospecimens, and ASD participant recruitment. A total of 33 resources were found containing different types of data from varying numbers of participants. Description of the data available from each data resource, and links to each resource is provided. Moreover, key implications are addressed and underrepresented areas of data are identified.",2586160182; 2060599047,Reem Al-jawahiri; Elizabeth Milne

It is seen as the systematic maintenance, improvement, broadening of knowledge and skills of developing personal qualities necessary for the execution of personal duties throughout working life (The Chartered Institute of Professional Development, 2000). CPD has been embraced by the College of Occupational Therapists (COT 2007) and is a mandatory requirement of the Health Professions Council (2008). 

In order to make the most of Continuing Professional Development, it is important for individuals and organisations to have a process which guides both activity and dissemination. The TRAMM (Talk, Record, Action, Mentor and Measure) model was designed in 2009 by a group of students in Glyndwr University, Wrexham during their final level studies. The model aims to provide a framework to guide both individuals and organisations and enable them to maximize the potential of CPD. Feedback from potential users of the model has been invaluable in helping to refine the components and it has continued to develop since its inception. It is now being piloted in x organisations and also by individuals who also have the opportunity to utilise the TRAMM Tracker, a tool for tracking progress with CPD.",2672476131; 2307257975; 2036804536,Rosanna Morris; Sarah Lawson; Deborah Hearle

The PGC has recently commenced a program of research designed to deliver “actionable” findings—genomic results that 1) reveal fundamental biology, 2) inform clinical practice, and 3) deliver new therapeutic targets. The central idea of the PGC is to convert the family history risk factor into biologically, clinically, and therapeutically meaningful insights.

A direct measure of impact would require tracking data (re)use in the wild, which is difficult to achieve. This is therefore commonly replaced by simpler metrics based on data download and citation counts. In this paper we describe a scenario where it is possible to track the trajectory of a dataset after its publication, and show how this enables the design of accurate models for ascribing credit to data originators. A Data Trajectory (DT) is a graph that encodes knowledge of how, by whom, and in which context data has been re-used, possibly after several generations. We provide a theoretical model of DTs that is grounded in the W3C PROV data model for provenance, and we show how DTs can be used to automatically propagate a fraction of the credit associated with transitively derived datasets, back to original data contributors. We also show this model of transitive credit in action by means of a Data Reuse Simulator. In the longer term, our ultimate hope is that credit models based on direct measures of data reuse will provide further incentives to data publication. We conclude by outlining a research agenda to address the hard questions of creating, collecting, and using DTs systematically across a large number of data reuse instances in the wild.",2075150303,Paolo Missier

In 2014, a Cochrane review was published, based exclusively on an almost complete set of clinical study reports and other regulatory documents. Clinical study reports can run to thousands of pages, providing an extensive amount of information on the planning, conduct and results of each trial. After a protracted campaign to obtain the reports, the manufacturers of the medications provided them unconditionally. The review authors subsequently published the underlying documents simultaneously with the Cochrane review, endorsing the concept of open science. In the following commentary, the background to and results of this review are summarized and put into clinical context.",2167388226; 2164947860; 2421461973; 2179564329; 1918863496; 2050539520,Mark Jones; Tom Jefferson; Peter Doshi; C.

Our dataset reflects that outputs with “digital humanities” in their metadata were not published in fully-fledged Open Access journals. The role of SSRN and arXiv as open repositories was found to be relatively significant, but the licensing of the outputs available through them was not always immediately clearly displayed. Our working definition of ""Open Access"" requires outputs to be open for human and machine access through CC-BY or at least CC-BY-SA. The absence of clear licensing information at output level is perceived to be problematic, as is the lack of any outputs clearly and visibly licensed with CC-BY. The fact the 3 most-mentioned outputs in the dataset were available without a paywall might signal towards the potential of Open Access for greater public impact. ‘Free access’ outputs in paywalled journals did not reflect higher mentions nor citations than their paywalled or non-paywalled counterparts. Though the dataset reflects a predictable dominance of authors based in the USA, the dataset points towards a growing presence of international digital humanities researchers.",2130482446; 2029699963; 1912349084,Ernesto Priego; Leo Havemann; Javiera Atenas

It allows authors to better and more transparently present their findings ensuing from the research question, linked with the arising data, as well as the methodology used and conclusions described in their papers. For example, contributors of research data can be better credited. Scientists interested in verifying or re-using results of their colleagues gain a better insight and can ideally access the actual tools that are linked to the research results.

Unfortunately, optimal refinement using DEN restraints requires extensive calculations and is often hindered by a lack of access to sufficient computational resources. The DEN web service presented here intends to provide structural biologists with access to resources for running computationally intensive DEN refinements in parallel on the Open Science Grid, the US cyberinfrastructure. Access to the grid is provided through a simple and intuitive web interface integrated into the SBGrid Science Portal. Using this portal, refinements combined with full parameter optimization that would take many thousands of hours on standard computational resources can now be completed in several hours. An example of the successful application of DEN restraints to the human Notch1 transcriptional complex using the grid resource, and summaries of all submitted refinements, are presented as justification.",1964182977; 2075095072; 2159805545; 83906791; 2645887603; 123431303; 306978079,Daniel O'Donovan; Ian Stokes-Rees; Yunsun Nam; Stephen C.

While several frameworks (de Leeuw (2015); McDonnell et al. (2012); Mason and Suri (2011); Lange et al. (2015)) have provided infrastructure and methods for individual research groups to develop paradigms, missing is a coordinated effort to develop paradigms linked with a system to easily deploy them. This disorganization leads to redundancy in development, divergent implementations of conceptually identical tasks, disorganized and error-prone code lacking documentation, and difficulty in replication. The ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and neuroscience research (Baker (2015); Open Science Collaboration (2015)) highlights the urgency of this challenge: reproducible research in behavioral psychology is conditional on deployment of equivalent experiments. A large, accessible repository of experiments for researchers to develop collaboratively is most efficiently accomplished through an open source framework. Here we present the Experiment Factory, an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments. The modular infrastructure includes experiments, virtual machines for local or cloud deployment, and an application to drive these components and provide developers with functions and tools for further extension. We release this infrastructure with a deployment (http://www.expfactory.org) that researchers are currently using to run a set of over 80 standardized web-based experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. By providing open source tools for both deployment and development, this novel infrastructure holds promise to bring reproducibility to the administration of experiments, and accelerate scientific progress by providing a shared community resource of psychological paradigms.",2046836365; 2414621399; 2402158590; 2633645011; 1951693905; 820547186,Vanessa Sochat; Ian W.

After providing some historical and philosophical context for this proposal, I outline how such a program could be implemented with little institutional overhead by existing research universities.

The field of timing and time perception has witnessed tremendous growth and multidisciplinary interest in the recent years with the advent of modern neuroimaging and neurophysiological approaches. In this article, I used a data mining approach to analyze the timing literature published by a select group of researchers (n = 202) during the period 2000-2015 and highlight important reviews as well as empirical articles that meet the criterion of a minimum of 100 citations. The qualifying articles (n = 150) are listed in a table along with key details such as number of citations, names of authors, year and journal of publication as well as a short summary of the findings of each study. The results of such a data-driven approach to literature review not only serve as a useful resource to any researcher interested in timing, but also provides a means to evaluate key papers that have significantly influenced the field and summarize recent progress and popular research trends in the field. Additionally, such analyses provides food for thought about future scientific directions and raises important questions about improving organizational structures to boost open science and progress in the field.

We argue that this crisis can be addressed by the open availability of the code and data that generated the results, in other words practicing reproducible computational science. In this paper we present a new computational infrastructure called RunMyCode.org that is designed to support published articles by providing a dissemination platform for the code and data that generated the their results. Published articles are given a companion webpage on the RunMyCode.org website from which a visitor can both download the associated code and data, and execute the code in the cloud directly through the RunMyCode.org website. This permits results to be verified through the companion webpage or on a user's local system. RunMyCode.org also permits a user to upload their own data to the companion webpage to check the code by running it on novel datasets. Through the creation of “coder pages” for each contributor to RunMyCode.org, we seek to facilitate social network-like interaction. Descriptive information appears on each coder page, including demographic data and other companion pages to which they made contributions. In this paper we motivate the rationale and functionality of RunMyCode.org and outline a vision of its future.",2602354082; 1908621684; 282760873,Victoria C.

The Research Data Alliance (RDA), which is developing an open Internet platform structured much like the World Wide Web, aims to enable greater collaboration among scientists of all disciplines and from all parts of the globe through the use and reuse of data. Its mission, say the founders, is to unlock the innovation potential of research data by encouraging and enabling scientists to publish the data underlying their research results.The move comes amid growing demands in the research community for tools that allow researchers not only to share their data, but also to manage and make use of the huge volumes of data being generated through literally billions of computers, sensors, and other connected devices-a development known as Big Data. The aim, said John Wood, the European Union cochairman of the RDA, speaking in a recent webinar, is to ensure that when scientists seek access to the data of their peers, ""this data is available to them in a format they can use.""RDA, which was supported in its earlier stages by Europe, the United States, and Australia, faces no shortage of challenges, experts agree. The technical challenges begin with the need for a common framework to assure interoperability. For instance, the various elements of this new scientists' web-the various codes, policies, standards, and practices-need to be harmonized to allow data sharing. And that infrastructure, says Francine Berman, who chairs the RDA in the United States, needs to span not only countries and continents, but also scientific disciplines and industrial sectors-""anywhere there is interest in data-driven innovation, which is practically everywhere.""Then there are the various responses to the idea of sharing. Scientists, commercial research interests, and governments are at odds on the issue. A growing number of governments in industrialized nations are demanding open access to research outputs from publicly funded research and development projects. In 2012, for instance, the European Commission committed to the Open Data movement, arguing that information already paid for by taxpayers ""should not be paid for again each time it is accessed or used"" and should benefit European businesses and citizens ""to the full.""In February, the U.S. government announced a new open-access policy requiring publications from taxpayerfunded research to be made free to read after a year's delay. That policy expands the National Institutes of Health (NIH) approach, which, until now, has applied only to work in the biomedical sciences. The White House move came just a week after FASTR (Fair Access to Science and Technology Research), a bill that would speed release of publicly funded research to just six months and expand the reach of the policy, was introduced in the U.S Congress. Within the EU, the United Kingdom has led the way, declaring that all research funded through the nation's research councils must be made freely and openly available to anyone around the world; the policy went into effect on April 1, 2013.Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda, spoke about the era of open science at a recent forum. ""Only when results and evidence are shared can the community examine and compare, discard, and learn,"" she said. ""There can be no modern science without sharing. We are putting openness at the heart of EU research and innovation funding."" Farnam Jahanian, director of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering directorate at the U.S. government's National Science Foundation (NSF), shares a similar view. ""We need policies for data sharing and open access,"" he said in March at the RDA launch. ""Data represents unprecedented opportunities to accelerate scientific discovery and innovation."" In that context, Jahanian pointed to the Obama administration's announced $200 million funding of the Big Data Research and Development Initiative, which aims to advance the technologies needed for effective analysis and use of data and which will work with the RDA. …",1965495964,MaryAnne M.

Starting from the PhD thesis, my researches aimed to understand the behaviour of academia in front of such new environmental pressures and uncovered a detailed account of the patenting activity in Italian universities, its national legislation, its university-level rules and practices, the faculty opinions, and the relations between all these factors. Some results contained in this book are new (and were more at the time the researches were originally conducted), some are not but the novelty lies in the specific setting in which they are inspected (there is an increasing view that the successful US model cannot simply be exported in different cultures and economic environments). Replication per se is an important value of science that has high consideration, but unfortunately little application. Finally, an important peculiarity of this contribution lies in the global overview through which the phenomenon is presented, including so many different perspectives. First, the collection of the regulations issued by Italian universities since 1993 to manage the IP issue provides insight into the organisational context at each institutions. Then, a collection of the patent applications filed by Italian universities since 1964 provides a measure of the formal involvement of faculty and university in patenting activity. Finally, two surveys to the patenting and to the non-patenting researchers working in the same disciplines provide insights into the faculty perceptions regarding the motivation and the environment (problems, potential improvements) for the patenting activity. Special attention is dedicated to respondents which report to having reasoned about (and possibly engaged in) patenting activity, but which finally gave up before any patent could be filed. It is impossible to recap here the several findings contained in the book. Among others, the reader shall find: an impressive review of the literature (more than 300 papers reviewed!!!, with a special focus on the potential problems from the patenting and licensing activity of the university, an issue that has been quite overlooked by past reviews), a dynamic view of institutional isomorphism, the prevalence of the academic management system over changes in IP legislation for patenting activity, the dependence of the motivations to patent or not on research area and gender and potentially on other characteristics for which I did not control, the use of different sources and different perspective in analysing a research topic in order to assess potential response biases owing to inconsistent responses in the surveys, a model investigating the effect that the individual perceptions have on patents (thus bridging a micro and a macro perspective that, on the contrary, are largely being treated as separated), etc…",1771675270,Nicola Baldini

Indicators that estimate the extent and utility of such secondary use of research data need to reflect this complex and highly variable data usage. By linking open access scientific literature, via Europe PubMedCentral, to the metadata in biological data resources we separate data citations associated with a deposition statement from citations that capture the subsequent, long-term, reuse of data in academia and industry.  We extend this analysis to begin to investigate citations of biomolecular resources in patent documents. We find citations in more than 8,000 patents from 2014, demonstrating substantial use and an important role for data resources in defining biological concepts in granted patents to both academic and industrial innovators. Combined together our results indicate that the citation patterns in biomedical literature and patents vary, not only due to citation practice but also according to the data resource cited. The results guard against the use of simple metrics such as citation counts and show that indicators of data use must not only take into account citations within the biomedical literature but also include reuse of data in industry and other parts of society by including patents and other scientific and technical documents such as guidelines, reports and grant applications.",2529260435; 2266112904; 2117093475; 2477924946; 2035468004; 2117867372; 2120643991; 2153909480; 2095875363; 2649282089; 1899861429,David Bousfield; Blaise T.

The idea of a 3D VFT service emerged from Virtual Skiddaw App, the 3D virtual geology fieldtrip, of The Open University’s (OU) Open Science Laboratory . In the feasibility project, we (at the OU) (co-investigator) along with Daden (project-lead) and Design Thinkers, UK (co-investigator) we looked into the technical, pedagogical, commercial and service design aspects of the 3D VFT service. 

In this presentation, we focussed on the pedagogy strand of this feasibility project: pedagogical advantages of 3D VFTs, and the challenges for their adoption in schools and HEIs. 

We discussed the following: 

pedagogical underpinnings of 3D virtual environments and 3D VFTs in disciplines such as geology, biology, environmental science/studies and geography which are founded on field observations, exploration and enquiry;

potential of integrating VFTs within the curricula in schools and in HEIs;

perceptions of educators, students and assessment bodies towards 3D VFTs, and virtual fieldwork, in general; we used the Virtual Skiddaw App in workshops and presentations to illustrate the concept of a 3D VFT;

views of stakeholders towards the 3D VFT service: advantages, challenges and their requirements from this service.  

Our empirical investigations have been user-centred – focussing on the stakeholders and particularly, the end-users such as educators, students and fieldwork specialists, and we have interacted with them via interviews, service design workshops, demonstrations and a survey to elicit their perceptions and requirements.",2010112508; 2232296729; 1261240595; 2673166750; 2289092199; 2223945883,Shailey Minocha; Steve Tilling; Tom Argles; Nick Braithwaite; David Burden; James Rock

The Open Science Grid consortium not only provides services and software to an increasingly diverse set of scientific communities, but also fosters a collaborative team of practitioners and researchers who use, support and advance the state of the art in large-scale distributed computing. The scale of the infrastructure can be expressed by the daily throughput of around seven hundred thousand jobs, just under a million hours of computing, a million file transfers, and half a petabyte of data movement.

Open access advocates argue that scholarly communities need to organize against the currently unworkable system whereby academics donate articles for free, yet have to buy them back at often exorbitant prices from journal publishers. In particular, they seek to replace subscription-based funding of journals with a range of alternatives that includes self-archiving and publication fees by researchers and their sponsors. The central claims of my study are twofold. The first is that the open access movement has indeed highlighted the need for the reform of scholarly publishing markets and practices. My second claim, however, is that certain proposals and models for reform are premised on over-optimistic views about disintermediation in scholarly communication as well as exaggerated assertions about the benefits of removing price barriers when larger issues about the system of ‘open science’ remain to be addressed.",1960693507,Richard Wellen

I was generally supportive of the open-access (OA) movement that PLoS helped foment. But OA publishing in biomedicine was in its infancy, and it was unclear how and if it would succeed. The question that most interested me was whether researchers would choose OA venues for high-profile papers that could have been published in the “big” closed-access journals. I was struggling with this issue myself, as I was working in a hot field (genome sequencing) whose papers were being actively solicited by journals like Nature and Science. Convincing myself and colleagues to forgo the potentially career-building prestige of these venerable publishing titans to “do the right thing” and go with new OA journals was tough. Thus, PLoS Biology, with its goal of being an OA venue for top-tier science, had great appeal.

So I accepted the invitation and became an Academic Editor. But I confess that I was not yet a true convert to OA or to PLoS Biology. So I decided to do what any good scientist should do in such a situation—I planned a publishing experiment. I'd had many papers in Science and Nature before. And so I convinced my collaborators on a high-profile paper to submit it to PLoS Biology, to see how this new high-profile OA journal would compare.

But then, while finalizing the paper, a two-month-long medical nightmare ensued that eventually ended in the stillbirth of my first child. While my wife and I struggled with medical mistakes and negligence, we felt the need to take charge and figure out for ourselves what the right medical care should be. And this is when I experienced the horror of closed-access publishing. For unlike my colleagues at major research universities that have subscriptions to all journals, I worked at a 300-person nonprofit research institute with a small library. So there I was—a scientist and a taxpayer—desperate to read the results of work that I helped pay for and work that might give me more knowledge than possessed by our doctors. And yet either I could not get the papers or I had to pay to read them without knowing if they would be helpful. After we lost our son, I vowed to never publish in non-OA journals if I was in control.

When I returned to work, we submitted our paper to PLoS Biology, and it was accepted and published in 2004. My OA conversion meant that I was no longer looking at this as an experiment. But it was still an experiment for my collaborators, as well as for colleagues who were skeptical of PLoS Biology. And contrary to the dire predictions of some, the experience was spectacular. Not only did we get the same press coverage and scientific acclaim as with other high-profile papers we had published, but we also got attention from people outside of our field, from nonscientists, and even from a neighbor or two.

In the four years since we published that paper, PLoS Biology has rapidly proven that OA and “top tier” can go hand-in-hand, thanks to the combined efforts of its staff and Academic Editors and the scientists who have chosen to publish in the journal. And as PLoS Biology has thrived, it has become the central icon of PLoS and OA, lending its prestige to PLoS's other ventures, including community-run journals and now PLoS ONE.

But that is the past. The key question now is—where does PLoS Biology go from here? It is from a desire to help answer that question that I have agreed to serve as Academic Editor-in-Chief. In this role I have three main goals.

First, I want to work to preserve and improve upon the partnership between academic and professional editors that makes PLoS Biology different from other top-tier journals (see the accompanying Editorial by the PLoS Biology Editors for more details on how PLoS Biology works). This partnership presents many difficulties in running the journal and plotting its future, as unlike society journals or other specialty journals, PLoS Biology Academic Editors are from all over the map, literally and figuratively. But what can unite the Academic Editors is OA itself, and I believe that OA provides a powerful bridge to get the Academic Editor community more involved in the journal beyond just shepherding papers.

Second, I want to work with the professional staff at PLoS Biology, the Academic Editors, and anyone else in the community who shares my desire to build new initiatives that will keep PLoS Biology as a top-tier journal. These would include ideas like producing issues dedicated to particular themes, actively recruiting excellent papers in fields where OA is not yet common, producing more outreach and educational material, and engaging bloggers and fully embracing the Web 2.0 world.

Finally, I want to leverage PLoS Biology's position as one of the best and best-known OA journals to energize the OA movement itself. The Creative Commons licenses that PLoS journals use (see http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/license.php) provide a wealth of benefits to users—who are restricted only by their creativity in how they can use PLoS Biology's contents. I am particularly interested in promoting ways for educators to take full advantage of the benefits of unrestricted, free access to scientific publications. I would like to see PLoS Biology contribute to educational initiatives not just by producing material itself but also by demonstrating innovative applications of Creative Commons material in science education—surely a boon to overburdened, under-resourced teachers everywhere. I also believe that PLoS Biology can help provide more direct benefits to those who choose to publish in OA journals by lobbying university promotion and hiring committees, funding agencies, and others to encourage OA publishing and to reward it. Given that there are various inducements for other aspects of open science (e.g., many funding agencies require open data release and encourage making software open source), why should there not be rewards for OA publishing?


In the end, I simply love PLoS Biology and OA publishing. I am looking forward to my new role at PLoS Biology, and I hope to help further its success and that of the OA movement.

Every day thousands of ordinary citizens are engaging in data collection and data processing, giving rise to the new field of citizen science. Never before has the technology enabled scientists to reach out to such vast numbers of collaborators and show their work to the public. From pattern recognition in Hubble space telescope images of distant galaxies to field observations of migration patterns of birds in the rural areas of United States, the possibilities are countless. Certainly this new trend poses important problems and challenges, but it is also obvious that wide acceptance of citizen science can lead not only to great scientific results, but to the popularization of scientific method among the public. In the paper we examine the current state of citizen science, we outline some of the most interesting and difficult challenges in leading scientific projects on such scale, and we present typologies of citizen science projects. We also provide a survey of ICT tools available for citizen science projects.",1070051832,Mikołaj Morzy

Climate change. Air pollution and top soil depletion. Water shortages and intractable conflicts. Disease, poverty, hunger, terrorism, natural disasters, and anomie ... the world is full of tough problems. What would a sustainable open infrastructure dedicated to finding solutions look like?
	For many of the toughest problems, it will have to lower financial, disciplinary, and bureaucratic boundaries to make more use of non–specialists — interested citizens who are willing to share their knowledge, expertise, connections, and commitment to confront common challenges. This implies that the investment required per citizen to get involved must be relatively low, whether measured in money, time, or technical expertise. Our goal in this paper is to demonstrate how to start building an effective open system to support such sharing today.
	Many of the tools exist already, both technical and social. Many of the requisite technical tools exist as inexpensive or free software, e.g. for information sharing, discussions, audio conferencing, small–scale video conferencing, and simultaneous editing. Social tools are often more difficult to master than technical ones. They include filtering contributions and contributors to separate the wheat from the chaff, building a sense of community and shared goals, motivating contributors to stay involved, making the link from smaller to larger efforts, and keeping the whole process fun and productive. Different “collaboration modes” can be identified, each with characteristic interaction topologies and scale of people involved.
	We look at two case studies that we have been involved with: developing strategies for dealing with peak oil scenarios, and contributing to the online magazine WorldChanging (at http://worldchanging.com/). For us and for many others who were and are involved in such open initiatives, a big part of the motivation to spend so much time and effort solving problems is enjoyment of ""productive fun"". After all, nobody has to worry about making bars or coffee shops “sustainable”. Our challenge is to make a problem–solving infrastructure so much fun that it becomes a natural, widely accepted custom — a combination of widely available software, open science, and open content that leads to open participation in building our common future.",1732840688; 2100153184,Hassan Masum; Mark Tovey

The evidence supports the broad interpretation that we call the ‘Stanford–Yale–Sussex’ synthesis. Second, such patterns yield important implications with respect to the so-called ‘European Paradox’, i.e. the conjecture that EU countries play a leading global role in terms of top-level scientific output, but lag behind in the ability of converting this strength into wealth-generating innovations. Some descriptive evidence shows that, contrary to the ‘paradox’ conjecture, Europe's weaknesses reside both in its system of scientific research and in a relatively weak industry. The final part of the paper identifies a few normative implications: much less emphasis should be put on various types of ‘networking’, and much more on policy measures aimed at strengthening both frontier research and European corporate actors.",2074039265; 2101870075; 2023816296,Giovanni Dosi; Patrick Llerena; Mauro Sylos Labini

In this paper, we investigate the impact of socio-communication strategies on innovation capacity based on experiments using a general-purpose model that aims to study dynamic processes of collective creativity in scientific communities. Experimental results indicate that low communication frequency, openness and receptivity lead to higher variety. On the contrary, variety decreases with increasing receptivity under high communication frequency. If more communication channels exist, the connectivity-driven preferential attachment strategy is beneficial in fostering innovation in terms of generated networks with low density and high centrality. Additionally, balance theory suggests higher levels of knowledge diffusion efficiency.",2160511730; 1660732377,Guangyu Zou; Levent Yilmaz

A growing emphasis on open science and reproducibility is changing how authors cite and acknowledge “research infrastructures”—entities that are used as inputs to or as underlying foundations for scholarly research, including data sets, software packages, computational models, observational platforms, and computing facilities. At the same time, stakeholder interest in quantitative understanding of impact is spurring increased collection and analysis of metrics related to use of research infrastructures. This article reviews work spanning several decades on tracing and assessing the outcomes and impacts from these kinds of research infrastructures. We discuss how research infrastructures are identified and referenced by scholars in the research literature and how those references are being collected and analyzed for the purposes of evaluating impact. Synthesizing common features of a wide range of studies, we identify notable challenges that impede the analysis of impact metrics for research infrastructures and outline key open research questions that can guide future research and applications related to such metrics.",169859894; 2121343216; 2546599597; 2129219673,Matthew S.

They have traditionally been applied to alternative institutional contexts. The strong IPR model has been associated to the business environment, while the open science model has been associated to the academic or research system. More recently, a strengthening of the IPR system has occurred in the public research system, and open science models have been adopted in private sectors like the open source software. This paper discusses these different models and their implications on the innovative activity of firms and economies, and the market dynamics. One of the main benefits deriving from a strong IPR system is that it encourages the entry of new technology-based firms and the commercialisation of technologies in markets for technologies. At the same time, an increased patent protection is also associated to potential costs, such as those arising from a excessive fragmentation of property rights, an abuse of patent protection for strategic reasons (sleeping and blocking patents), and an increase in litigation costs.",2663328576; 1221959731,Fabrizio Cesaroni; Paola Giuri

However, for the data to be preserved they must undergo digital curation process, whose main methodology is to give them structural and semantic metadata to ensure transmission of knowledge for the future. On the other hand, under the open science, there is a worldwide trend to give free access to scientific journals and this demand now extends to the free and intelligible access of data generated by scientific research.

Yet current study is hampered by the long-known problems of inadequate management of data and insufficient description of analytical procedures, especially in the field of ecology. Despite recent institutional incentives to share data and new data archiving infrastructure, many ecologists do not archive and publish their data and code. Given current rapid rates of global change, the consequences of this are extreme: because an ecological dataset collected at a certain place and time represents an irreproducible set of observations, ecologists doing local, independent research possess, in their file cabinets and spreadsheets, a wealth of information about the natural world and how it is changing. Although large-scale initiatives will increasingly enable and reward open science, we believe that change demands action and personal commitment by individuals – from students and PIs. Herein, we outline the major benefits of sharing data and analytical procedures in the context of global change ecology, and provide guidelines for overcoming common obstacles and concerns. If individual scientists and laboratories can embrace a culture of archiving and sharing we can accelerate the pace of the scientific method and redefine how local science can most robustly scale up to globally relevant questions.",2067998882; 2051044705; 2084192875,Elizabeth M.

The reality of scientific sample collections not being digitised to the essence of molecules, isotopes and electrons becomes unbelievable to the upgrowing generation of scientists.
Just like any other geological institute the Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research GEOMAR accumulated thousands of specimen. The samples, collected mainly during marine expeditions, date back as far as 1964. Today GEOMAR houses a central geological sample collection of at least 17 000 m of sediment core and more than 4 500 boxes with hard rock samples and refined sample specimen. This repository, having been dormant, missed the onset of the interconnected digital age. Physical samples without barcodes, QR codes or RFID tags need to be migrated and reconnected, urgently. 
In our use case, GEOMAR opted for the International Geo Sample Number IGSN as the persistent identifier. Consequentially, the software CurationDIS by smartcube GmbH as the central component of this project was selected. The software is designed to handle acquisition and administration of sample material and sample archiving in storage places. In addition, the software allows direct embedding of IGSN. We plan to adopt IGSN as a future asset, while for the initial inventory taking of our sample material, simple but unique QR codes act as “bridging identifiers” during the process.
Currently we compile an overview of the broad variety of sample types and their associated data. QR-coding of the boxes of rock samples and sediment cores is near completion, delineating their location in the repository and linking a particular sample to any information available about the object. Planning is in progress to streamline the flow from receiving new samples to their curation to sharing samples and information publically. Additionally, interface planning for linkage to GEOMAR databases OceanRep (publications) and OSIS (expeditions) as well as for external data retrieval are in the pipeline.
Looking ahead to implement IGSN, taking on board lessons learned from earlier generations, it will enable to comply with our institute’s open science policy. Also it will allow to register newly collected samples already during ship expeditions. They thus receive their ""birth certificate"" contemporarily in this ever faster revolving scientific world.",2530704633; 2436193236; 1993513962,Doris Maicher; Dirk Fleischer; Andreas Czerniak

I fill this gap in two ways. First, I report the results of a faculty survey on obstacles to patenting activity in Italian universities, targeted both to inventors and to those non-inventors which reported to engage in university patenting activity and to give up before any patents could be filed. Second, I investigate their effect in a regression model using universities' patent counts as the dependent variable. Results show that obstacles to university patenting activity reduce to four dimensions: lack of support mechanisms (including insufficient reward for researchers, lack of a TTO, lack of funds to cover patenting costs), commercialisation problems, too heavy teaching and administrative duties, and personal/cultural problems (related to the scarce knowledge of institutional-level patent regulations and to the ""open science"" mentality of the university). Among them, however, only the lack of support by the university administration reduces the patent counts. Publication productivity has an inverted U-shaped relation with patent counts, but the overall effect is still largely positive, given the current publication levels.",1771675270,Nicola Baldini

It also helps bridge the gap between knowledge production and its use whenever academics become involved with open source development contrary to the proprietary model where software is produced within the confines of commercial vendors R&D labs. However in higher education, open source has not broken through the bottom of the software stack where it is confined to fulfilling mostly system computing requirements. At the application and visible level, open source adoption is hampered by a number of factors chief amongst these is the lack of reliable ICT governance structures. The problem is exacerbated in developing country contexts where governance in general is subjected to the power-play between several actors of the higher education scene. The governance conundrum faced by open source adoption in developing countries is illustrated through a detailed case study of an open source project failure at GNU, an American-style university in the Gulf region. The rise and fall of GNU open source project is discussed within a general framework of ICT and open source governance in developing countries higher education sector. Lessons are drawn from the case to recommend a FOSS strategy for development.",1914609510,Sofiane Sahraoui

The aim of this white paper is to provide a framework for integrating computational proteomics into ELIXIR in the near future, and thus to broaden the portfolio of omics technologies supported by this European distributed infrastructure. This white paper is the direct result of a strategy meeting on 'The Future of Proteomics in ELIXIR' that took place in March 2017 in Tubingen (Germany), and involved representatives of eleven ELIXIR nodes. These discussions led to a list of priority areas in computational proteomics that would complement existing activities and close gaps in the portfolio of tools and services offered by ELIXIR so far. We provide some suggestions on how these activities could be integrated into ELIXIR's existing platforms, and how it could lead to a new ELIXIR use case in proteomics. We also highlight connections to the related field of metabolomics, where similar activities are ongoing. This white paper could thus serve as a starting point for the integration of computational proteomics into ELIXIR. Over the next few months we will be working closely with all stakeholders involved, and in particular with other representatives of the proteomics community, to further refine this paper.

These digital traces of behavior and cognition offer cognitive scientists and psychologists an unprecedented opportunity to test theories outside the laboratory. Despite general excitement about big data and naturally occurring datasets among researchers, three “gaps” stand in the way of their wider adoption in theory-driven research: the imagination gap, the skills gap, and the culture gap. We outline an approach to bridging these three gaps while respecting our responsibilities to the public as participants in and consumers of the resulting research. To that end, we introduce Data on the Mind (http://www.dataonthemind.org), a community-focused initiative aimed at meeting the unprecedented challenges and opportunities of theory-driven research with big data and naturally occurring datasets.

Since communication is at the heart of science, these technologies provide researchers easy mechanisms to share ideas, data and algorithms. These technologies complement formal means of sharing knowledge via conferences and published papers, where it is impossible to share all the research details, and where negative results are rarely included. Meanwhile, science software developers are converting data processing, analysis, mining and visualization algorithms into publicly available web services, allowing researchers access to large suites of algorithms for data processing and science analysis. This model of chaining services to create analysis workflows provides the research community unprecedented opportunity to collaborate, sharing their workflows, reproducing and analyzing research results, and leveraging colleagues' expertise to expedite the process of scientific knowledge discovery. In many cases, the output of one workflow can be an input to others, leading to chained workflows with components shared by two or more researchers. A crucial component to foster this unprecedented cooperation within the research community is a reusable, extensible and customizable environment for building collaborative “open science” portals to manage these shared analysis workflows. Current collaborative portals are often one- time development efforts for specific science domains that cannot be easily extended beyond their initial features or reused by other science domains. As part of a current NASA project, we are developing “Talkoot” (Finnish analogue to a barn raising): a customizable “software appliance” to build collaborative portals for Earth Science services and analysis workflows. Talkoot will allow researchers (not just information technologists) to build collaborative sites around service workflows within a few hours. Talkoot leverages Drupal, an open architecture Content Management System, as the framework for an online collaborative portal. Drupal also has a number of specialized modules developed by its user community to provide additional features. Talkoot adds Earth-science-specific modules to provide data searching, processing, analysis and mining capabilities. We will demonstrate the current prototype of Talkoot, which allows users to: create research experiments; select data sets; create data processing/analysis/mining workflows; execute these workflows on remote compute resources; and share both the results and the workflows with other users. Additional Talkoot features that are being developed or are planned will also be presented.",2212350525; 2156811270; 693572135; 1498728755; 2764165464,Christopher Lynnes; Rahul Ramachandran; Helen Conover; Sunil Movva; Brian Wilson

The analysis is based on a large dataset of over 11,500 research articles published in Italy in the period 2004-2010 in the areas of architecture, arts and humanities, history and philosophy, law, sociology and political sciences. These articles received a score by a large number of externally appointed referees in the context of the Italian research assessment exercise (VQR); similarly, journal scores were assigned in a panel-based independent assessment, which involved all academic journals in which Italian scholars have published, carried out under a different procedure. The score of an article is compared with that of the journal it is published in: more specifically, we first estimate an ordered probit model, assessing the probability for a paper of receiving a higher score, the higher the score of the journal; in a second step, we concentrate on the top papers, evaluating the probability of a paper receiving an excellent score having been published in a top-rated journal. In doing so, we control for a number of characteristics of the paper and its author, including the language of publication, the scientific field and its size, the age of the author and the academic status. We add to the literature on journal classification by providing for the first time a large scale test of the robustness of expert-based classification.",2012458041; 2010581839; 1973010581; 2603033773,Andrea Bonaccorsi; Tindaro Cicero; Antonio Ferrara; Marco Malgarini

However, little is known regarding how scientists considering jobs in industrial R&D make trade-offs between positions that allow publishing on the one hand and positions that do not allow publishing but offer higher pay on the other. Using data on over 1900 science and engineering PhD candidates about to enter the job market, we find that while some are unwilling to give up publishing at virtually any price, over one third of those most likely to seek positions in industrial research are willing to forego publishing for free. We develop a simple model of the “price” scientists assign to publishing in firms and explore potential sources of heterogeneity empirically. We find that the price of publishing increases with individuals’ preferences for various benefits from publishing such as peer recognition and contributing to society, but it decreases with their preference for money. Scientists who believe themselves to be of high ability and who train at top tier institutions have a higher price of publishing. Yet, they are more expensive to hire (not less) even if publishing is allowed. We discuss implications for research on the economics of science and on compensating differentials, for managers seeking to attract and retain academically trained personnel, and for firms considering their participation in open science.",1968859041; 2168976755,Henry Sauermann; Michael Roach

However, who is that explanation for, and how is this explanation communicated once it has been deduced?
Scientific research is typically communicated via papers in journals, with an abstract presented as a summary of that explanation. However, in many instances they may be written in a manner which is non-communicatory to a lay reader. This study begins to investigate if poetry could be used as an alternative form of communication, by first assessing if poetic verse is an effective form of communication to other scientists. In order to assess this suitability, a survey was conducted in which two different groups of participants were asked questions based on a scientific abstract. One group of participants was given the original scientific abstract, whilst the second group was instead given a poem written about the scientific study. Quantitative analysis found that whilst a scientific audience found a poetic interpretation of a scientific abstract to be no less interesting or inspiring than the original prose, they did find it to be less accessible. However, further qualitative analysis suggested that the poem did a good job in conveying a similar meaning to that presented in the original abstract. The results of this study indicate that whilst for a scientific audience poetry should not replace the prose abstract, it could be used alongside the original format to inspire the reader to find out more about the topic. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of this approach for a general audience.",1901784002,Samuel Illingworth

These three strategic priorities put a particular emphasis on the construction of students’ scientific identity. The guiding research question is as follows: What is the relationship between students’ scientific identity and English for Academic Purposes? Therefore, the aim of the present research is to analyse the scientific literature on the relationship between students’ scientific identity and English for Academic Purposes underpinning elaboration of a new research question for further studies. The theoretical framing herein will discuss the construction of scientific identity via academic language. The meaning of such key concepts as scientific identity and role models is studied. Moreover, the study demonstrates how the key concepts are related to the idea of English for Academic Purposes. The study demonstrates a logical chain: scientific identity → English for Academic Purposes → role models → an empirical study within a multicultural environment → conclusions. Research methods include theoretical and empirical methods. Theoretical methods comprise analysis of theoretical sources and theoretical modelling. In the empirical study, explorative study was employed. Interpretative research paradigm was used. The empirical study carried out in August 2015 involved 22 engineering students at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia. The results of the empirical study show that engineering students’ self-evaluation is of the low level. The findings of the research allow drawing the conclusion that use of role models in English for Academic Purposes is an opportunity for the construction of students’ scientific identity. The novel contribution of the paper is revealed in the newly formulated research question. Directions of further research are proposed.",2200242182; 2341379691; 1241786896; 2142513490,Jeļena Zaščerinska; Natalia Andreeva; Mihails Zaščerinskis; Ludmila Aļeksejeva

The reviews were done by two independent teams using the same data. They both found that recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein 2 (rhBMP-2), an orthobiological agent used in some surgeries to promote bone growth, shows little benefit in spinal fusion compared with iliac crest bone graft or other bone grafts, and that it may cause more harms.

The findings are published in the Annals of Internal Medicine and are based on patient level data from clinical trials conducted by Medtronic, which were shared with researchers through the Yale University open data access (YODA) project.1 2

We explored the assumption that the ecosystem services-(ES) concept has the potential to support communication and collaboration between actors in land use planning. If true, the concept could facilitate collaborative planning processes. We analyse how to evolve a planning context in which governance networks at the local landscape level gain importance in decision making, while the central government delegates power. From case studies presented during the symposium we learned that the ES-concept has been explored for application in local land use planning around the world. However, whether ES are recognized as a useful planning concept depends on individual actor preferences and cultural and contextual factors, such as the actual nature-human relationship and gender differences. Also, successful application requires the support of novel assessment, design and visualization tools, which are designed to foster collaboration and social learning. The potential of the concept to contribute to collaborative relationships needs further investigation.",1983529069; 2108498667; 2096198353; 2151099755; 141108112; 2247872523; 2111992750; 2171330058; 2572181393; 2670487002,Paul Opdam; Ariane Walz; Christian Albert; Christine Fürst; Adrienne Grêt-Regamey; Janina Kleemann; Dawn C.

As data publication venues proliferate, significant debate continues over formats, processes, and terminology. Here, we present an overview of data publication initiatives underway and the current conversation, highlighting points of consensus and issues still in contention. Data publication implementations differ in a variety of factors, including the kind of documentation, the location of the documentation relative to the data, and how the data is validated. Publishers may present data as supplemental material to a journal article, with a descriptive “data paper,” or independently. Complicating the situation, different initiatives and communities use the same terms to refer to distinct but overlapping concepts. For instance, the term published means that the data is publicly available and citable to virtually everyone, but it may or may not imply that the data has been peer-reviewed. In turn, what is meant by data peer review is far from defined; standards and processes encompass the full range employed in reviewing the literature, plus some novel variations. Basic data citation is a point of consensus, but the general agreement on the core elements of a dataset citation frays if the data is dynamic or part of a larger set. Even as data publication is being defined, some are looking past publication to other metaphors, notably “data as software,” for solutions to the more stubborn problems.",2043766733; 1436605125,John Ernest Kratz; Carly Strasser

Driven by the impetus of the Open Science movement, some researchers have put their laboratory notebook online, providing access to this occluded and largely unexplored research genre. Drawing on the notion of the adaptability of language, this paper proposes a case-study of an online genomics notebook from two perspectives, inter-generic and intra-generic. We first investigate the considerable adaptation that takes place when the record of experimental work in the notebook is shaped into a public research claim in the downstream research article genre, focusing on utterer-interpreter relations and the immediacy of the notebook vs the decontextualized reconstruction of the article. We then investigate how migration to the web also results in adaptation by comparing the online notebook with the traditional paper notebooks used in science labs. The comparison shows that the online version places more emphasis on emotive elements and that its language and presentational features are more informal. We conclude with some comments on the metapragmatic awareness of the author of the online notebook as he navigates between these different genres and media.",197734558; 2568296765,Shirley Carter-Thomas; Elizabeth Rowley-Jolivet

This need is met by rapid developments in the theory and measurement of health psychology constructs as evidenced by recent publications and conference contributions (e.g. Dima et al., 2014). However, these enhanced methods have been slow to disseminate into research practice. One reason may be that the new perspectives afforded by these developments and the related tools were not part of the curricula of most researchers currently active in health psychology. This lack of familiarity may manifest itself as an obstacle that appears difficult to overcome, thereby obstructing wide-spread use of these methods in research. The goal of the sixth Methods in Health Psychology symposium, held at the annual EHPS conference in Aberdeen in 2016, was to address this by increasing attendees’ familiarity with several new developments in this field. The symposium brought together five contributions, combining theory and methods from qualitative and quantitative traditions to provide a broad overview of the state of the art, limitations of current practices, and options for improvement. Moreover, the symposium aimed to give its attendants practical suggestions to apply these insights, as well as facilitate access to their corresponding tools. The symposium started with the presentation from Gjalt-Jorn Peters of a novel perspective on the nature and inter-relations of psychological variables and implications for their measurement. This perspective facilitates a flexible and theoretically promiscuous approach to operationalization and measurement, affording researchers more flexibility in the development and assessment of measurement instruments. This was followed by the presentation of Anne Marie Plass introducing tools to explore and improve operationalization in questionnaire development or adaptation using Cognitive Interviewing. Several problems with common assumptions about validity were pointed out and solutions provided for addressing these. Rik Crutzen provided an overview of the current practices regarding assessment of the quality of measurement instruments. Although these practices are strongly rooted in classical testing theory, important assumptions of the statistical models used were routinely violated. An accessible, freely-available procedure for improvement was introduced and explained. Alexandra Dima demonstrated stepwise procedures that leverage psychometric techniques to improve the understanding and operationalization of psychological constructs. Chris Gibbons introduced computer adaptive testing using Concerto, an open source system based on the flexible R and mySQL platforms, and discussed its benefits for health psychology research. At the end of the symposium, Frank Doyle summarized the five previous contributions and proposed several directions regarding how these insights can be implemented in practice to improve the standard of measurement in health psychology.

Science and the Modern World: 1925 Lowell Lectures .... Alfred North Whitehead The profession of research administration, like many others, is rapidly evolving. The characteristics that define the profession--such as what professionals need to do, and what they need to know--are much different now than they were just a few years ago. For better or worse, the die will be cast for the profession by those who have a strong interest and stake in what it will look like. Those who hold leadership positions in research administration and management are probably best positioned to envision what the profession will look like in the future. Because of this, I have asked several of the ""old hands"" in research administration to predict the future, and to tell us what they see for the coming years in research administration. To guide this, I initially asked them to think about: 1. Developments in the economics, structure, and operational practices of research administration organizations; 2. Changes in the ""curriculum"" and educational path for new and mid-level research administrators; 3. The pressures on research administrators and managers seeking to find balance between their professional and personal lives; and, 4. The implications of technology on the profession. Given the inherent difficulty in predicting the future with certainty, I asked my respondents to identify any particularly important current trends that are driving change. Understanding these trends may provide insights into the probable future in various areas of the profession and enable us to manage change as it unfolds. I also asked them to frame their reflections for us in light of the following three factors. Economic Situation Almost all institutions are seeking more efficient services, predictable costs, and increased responsiveness to the needs of principal investigators, sponsors, and the public. They are often willing to make dramatic changes in a research administration office or activity if they are not satisfied with the services they receive. The economic downturn of the past few years has produced considerable economic fallout, including lower revenue, reduced hiring, more downsizing, and greater internal reorganization. As the economy recovers, it is apparent that the profession, and research in general, will not return to business as usual; and that to be successful in the post-recession era, research managers may well need to engage in long-term restructuring to maintain sustainability and meet increasingly complex demands. Research executives and managers also will need to rethink the model and methodology of educating and training members of the profession to deliver services in the evolving research environment. Research institutions that do not understand and address these changes will have difficulty surviving in a world of ""translational"" research, rapid movement from basic science to commercialization, and a constant tension between open science and profit-driven innovation. Research institutions and their management will need to think more strategically, manage more effectively, and strive to be more results-centered than they have been in the past. Technological Acceleration Technology is a driving force for many of the changes in research and research administration. Technology is a double-edged sword that helps professionals to work faster and more efficiently, yet enables them to work constantly.

An increasing number of university students use Wikipedia for ""pre-research"", as part of their course assignments or research projects. Yet many among academics, scientists and experts turn their noses up at the thought of contributing to Wikipedia, despite a growing number of calls from the expert community to join the project. The Association for Psychological Science launched an initiative to get the scientific psychology community involved in improving the coverage and quality of articles in their field; biomedical experts recently called upon their peers to help make public health information in Wikipedia rigorous and complete; historians have recently started to contribute references to Wikipedia in an effort to make their scholarly work more easily accessible to a broad readership; chemists are curating Wikipedia to include structured metadata in articles on chemical compounds. The Wikimedia Foundation itself is exploring strategies to engage with the expert community and with higher education at large, as part of initiatives such as USPP or the expert review proposal.

These calls for participation, however, remain sporadic and most experts-- despite goodwill to contribute--still perceive major barriers to participation, which typically include issues of a technical, social and cultural nature, from the lack of incentives from the perspective of a professional career, to the poor recognition of one’s expertise within Wikipedia to issues of social interaction. In combination with the apparent anomaly of collaborative--and often anonymous--authorship and the resulting fluidity of Wikipedia articles, these factors create an environment that significantly differs from the ones experts are accustomed to.

There has been so far only anecdotal evidence on what keeps experts (defined in the broadest possible sense to include academics, but also expert professionals in industry and in the public sector, as well as research students) from contributing to Wikipedia. The Wikimedia Research Committee ran a survey on expert participation between February and April 2011 with over 3K respondents to try and turn anecdotes about expert participation into data. The aim of this talk is to present the results of the survey and tackle questions such as: the different perception of participation in Wikipedia across academic fields; the effects of expertise, gender, discipline, wiki literacy on participation; the gap between shared attitudes and individual drivers of participation; the relation between participation in Wikipedia and attitudes towards open access and open science.",2585285290; 2238988539; 1998347312; 2583673491,Dario Taraborelli; Daniel Mietchen; Panagiota Alevizou; Alastair Gill

TeraGrid operates a unified user support infrastructure and software environment across its eight resource partner sites, which together provide more than 40 teraflops of computing capability and mass storage capability in the petabytes, linked by networks operating at tens of Gigabit/sec. This unified environment allows TeraGrid users to access storage and information resources as well as over a dozen major computing systems via a single allocation, either as stand-alone resources or as components of a distributed application using Grid software capabilities. Many lessons can be drawn from the dual pursuit of high performance and close integration.

The next phase will be even more exciting, with the roll out of a wide range of science gateways and additional advanced applications. Science gateway projects are aimed at supporting access to TeraGrid via web portals, desktop applications or via other grids. An initial set of 10 gateways will address new scientific opportunities in fields from bioinformatics to nanotechnology as well as interoperation between TeraGrid and other Grid infrastructures.

TeraGrid is also enabling an impressive array of large scale science applications, where researchers can perform complex simulations and manipulate enormous data sets in novel ways to gain new insights into research questions and societal problems, for example, finding the most efficient and least expensive ways to clean up groundwater pollution.

Effort in these and other related areas will allow more researchers and educators access to TeraGrid capabilities and advance compatibility between TeraGrid and other major Grid deployments such as Open Science Grid, Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), and major European and Asian Grid deployments.",2046722123,Raymond A.

First, the title is too long, even in acronym form (WWTBTEOAMJ). Second, television viewers prefer shows on which competitors sing or dance, and academic physicians aren’t known for their pipes or mambo skills. The main reason WWTBTEOAMJ is a bad idea, though, is that worthy contestants would be too hard to find.

Editing a major general medical journal is no easy task. To succeed, a person must be open-minded and innovative, intelligent and media savvy, patient and thick-skinned. Finding someone with the requisite skills and knowledge can be challenging, as a search team at CMAJ will soon discover, having been assigned to find a replacement for the journal’s current editor-in-chief, Dr. Paul Hebert, who will be leaving his position sometime this year (www.cmaj.ca/cgi/doi/10.1503/cmaj.109-3769).

“An editor is a leader,” says Dr. Richard Smith, former BMJ editor-in-chief. “There are two things that a leader needs. The first is vision. What is it that we are trying to do here? Leaders don’t have to set the agenda entirely by themselves but are responsible for making sure there is some kind of vision — more than just getting the journal out every week and just ticking along. Secondly, they need an ability to inspire people with that vision and get them pointed in the same direction.”

Successful editors implement their visions and give their journals unique voices, while maintaining a sense of impartiality. Former New England Journal of Medicine editor-in-chief Dr. Jerome Kassirer once wrote that striking this balance is difficult (N Engl J Med 1999;340:1671–2): “Medical journal editors walk a fine line. They must aspire to impartiality, open-mindedness, and intellectual honesty. They must try to select material for its merit, interest to readers, and originality alone. They also want their journals to have a voice and a personality. If they are doing their jobs well, they should give no favors, and they should have no friends.”







Finding someone with all of the qualities necessary to be an editor-in-chief-cum-super-hero can be tricky.

The editor of a medical journal must also be experienced in critically appraising scientific articles, a skill that requires constant honing, says Smith, whose 13-year term as editor of BMJ ended in 2004. Good writing and public speaking skills are also essential, as are creativity and boldness. “A sense of boldness and a thick skin are important,” says Smith, now CEO of the European arm of UnitedHealth Group, a private US health care organization. “A journal sometimes has to speak truth to power and that’s going to be uncomfortable.”

One of an editor’s most critical skills, if a medical journal is to be successful, is the ability to identify and nurture talent. “Any journal that can’t be better than its editor is doomed,” says Smith. “The way to make a good journal is to find good people and give them space to do interesting things.”

In the United Kingdom, medical journals tend to pick editors from within their ranks, or people who at least have experience working for a scientific journal. By contrast, journals in the United States have a tradition of awarding the top job to distinguished academics, says Smith. One European medical journal, Smith recalls, had a joint editorship model: one editor with a journal background to handle day-to-day operations, another with impressive academic credentials to set strategic directions. The model has also been successfully adopted by several specialty journals.

This is similar to the co-CEO model in the business world, which has been used by companies such as financial giants Charles Schwab and Citigroup, and also technology leaders Motorola and Research In Motion. “The co-CEO model can work in a culture where cooperation and consensus are highly valued, and where command and control is not,” Joshua Greenbaum, an industry analyst and head of California-based Enterprise Applications Consulting, writes in an email.

Still, corporate co-leadership remains somewhat of an enigma, working well under some circumstances and not so well under others, says Steven Dennis, Aarestad Chair of Banking in the College of Business & Public Administration at the University of North Dakota.

“Co-CEOs that arise from co-founders seem to work very well and sometimes last for decades. Research in Motion, a Canadian company, has performed very well with co-CEOs,” Dennis, the lead author of a paper exploring the co-CEO model (J Bus Econ Stud 2009;15:1–25), writes in an email. “Other co-CEO arrangements arise from mergers and acquisitions, and those tend not to last very long. Still other co-CEO arrangements arise from ‘passing the torch’ to two siblings, and the success of those relationships is sketchy at best.”

Wherever hopeful editor-in-chief candidates spend the majority of their careers, it is important that they have a traceable — and successful — track record, says Dr. George Lundberg, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association from 1982 to 1999. “The person should have name recognition in the medical community. It shouldn’t be some dark horse who shows up unknown.”

There are many other critically important characteristics that a person should possess to be considered for a position running a major international medical journal, says Lundberg, now editor-in-chief of Cancer Commons, which promotes using open science to help cancer patients tailor care to their needs (http://cancercommons.org). These characteristics include high intellect, broad medical knowledge, high ethical standards, sensitivity of the needs of journal staff, strategic planning skills, comfort with technology, a gift for public relations and a commitment to improving public health.

“Once an editor is chosen who has all these characteristics, this person must be willing to learn how to be an editor. They must be cautious and modest about their capacity to be successful on day one, and be willing to learn on the job,” says Lundberg.

“It’s a very complicated job, encompassing the whole field of medicine, as well as public health, ethics and also business, because money has to come from somewhere,” adds Lundberg. “It is almost impossible to find someone who excels in all these areas. You find someone who has these qualities and excels in as many areas as possible.”",2143031192,Roger Collier

Das gemeinsame Prafix ""offen"" beinhaltet dabei zwei unterschiedliche Facetten: Zum einen die Offenheit des Zugangs zu Daten, Code oder Ergebnissen, zum anderen das Gebot der Transparenz, also der Offenlegung von Verfahren, Methoden und Zielen. Neben der Offenheit von Wissenschaft ist als ein weiteres Paradigma, das sich immer starker bemerkbar macht und zur Geltung gelangt, die zunehmende Vernetzung von online betriebener Wissenschaft und Forschung zu konstatieren. Etwa anderthalb bis zwei Jahrzehnte, nachdem das Internet bzw. das Digitale allgemein in der Wissenschaft bzw. der Wissenschaftskommunikation Einzug gehalten haben, wird die Vernetzung von Wissenschaft als ein dramatischer und grundlegender Wandel begriffen und beschrieben. Das Internet, Online-Kommunikation und Online-Verfahren revolutionieren nicht nur wirtschaftliche Prozesse, den (sozialen) Alltag der Menschen und weitere Lebensbereiche, sondern zunehmend auch Wissenschaft und Forschung. Einige der immer wieder in diesem Zusammenhang genannten Begrifflichkeiten sind Virtuelle Forschungsumgebungen, Forschungsdaten, Grid, Clouds usw.

For many governmental public health agencies, funding and staffing resources remain below their prerecession levels and show little sign of a bounce-back, indicating a new normal of seeking efficiencies in public health protections. At the same time, health insurance coverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act are prompting many public health agencies to renegotiate their roles and responsibilities with medical care providers and payers.1 Some agencies are scaling back their safety-net roles in the direct delivery of personal health services while expanding roles in supporting policy, system, and environmental changes that promote health and safety on a community-wide basis. Others are learning how to bill third-party payers for their services, and forging relationships with new delivery models such as accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes. Still others are forging new alliances with schools, worksites, retailers, farmers, housing authorities, and many other sectors to address the health issues embedded within other public and private sector decisions. Amid these changes, modern public health delivery systems are emerging as far more heterogeneous and multiorganizational than ever before.2

The complexity and diversity of these delivery systems create challenges for ensuring that everyone in the United States can benefit from the expanding array of research-tested programs, policies, and interventions that prevent disease and injury and promote health and safety on a population-wide basis. Knowledge about how best to organize, finance, and deliver these public health strategies in complex and constrained delivery systems is too often in short supply. The science surrounding the efficacy of individual public health interventions currently far outpaces the science surrounding the delivery system features and capabilities that support these interventions collectively in real-world settings.3 Consequently, implementation strategies that prove successful in one community may face political, economic, or logistical barriers in other settings. The growing heterogeneity of public health delivery systems demands a highly nuanced evidence base concerning which combination of public health strategies work best, in which organizational and community contexts, for which population segments, with what supporting infrastructure, and at what cost.4

The field of public health services and systems research (PHSSR) has become a leading source for this type of delivery system evidence in public health.5,6 In recent years, national research agendas have been established for the field in key areas of scholarship that include organization and structure, financing and economics, workforce, and information and communication technology.7–11 Dedicated research funding mechanisms have been created by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A constellation of public health practice-based research networks has formed across the United States to support researcher–practitioner collaboration in the production and application of this type of research.12 And a national coordinating center devoted to PHSSR has formed to stimulate scientific innovation, strengthen analytic rigor, promote methodological consistency and comparability, and ensure real-world relevance in this work.

If PHSSR is to realize its full potential in guiding the transformation of the US public health system, it will require “open science” mechanisms for accelerating the production and distribution of highly nuanced research findings about public health delivery.13 Currently, public health delivery systems are changing at a rate that far outpaces traditional research production and distribution cycles, resulting in many missed opportunities for studying and learning from these natural experiments. Mechanisms are needed for rapidly sharing research methodologies and data with other scholars in the field, and for rapidly communicating research results to decision-makers within public health delivery systems. An obvious model is the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), which widely and freely transmits brief summaries of findings from epidemiological studies to public health and medical professionals across the globe.

The PHSSR field now has its analog to MMWR in the form of a rapid-cycle, peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Public Health Services and Systems Research.14 Like MMWR, Frontiers publishes short summaries of preliminary results and top-line findings from new PHSSR studies. These summaries focus on how new findings advance the science of PHSSR and inform the transformation of real-world public health delivery systems. Also like MMWR, Frontiers is freely available to both producers and users of the research, with the aim of achieving the broadest possible reach even in low-resource settings. Commentaries are published with some of these articles to help place the new research in context. Frontiers does not replace the need for fully developed empirical research articles, but rather it offers a mechanism for rapidly disseminating early findings and emerging methods, thereby accelerating the progress of PHSSR.

Beginning with this issue, the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) will extend the reach of PHSSR studies by regularly publishing the abstracts of Frontiers articles along with full-text links. This partnership will allow both journals to play active roles in accelerating PHSSR production and application. AJPH’s wide reach to and credibility with the public health profession, combined with Frontier’s nimbleness in disseminating early and preliminary PHSSR evidence, makes this arrangement a high-value collaboration. The fruits of this collaboration, we believe, will help to transform the US public health system into a rapid-learning system in which research continually informs practice and practice continually motivates research.15 The result will be a continuously improving US public health system that seeks ever-better ways of deploying its resources for a healthier, safer, and more equitable nation.",1893785065; 2243711978,Glen P.

However it is also true that some of the modern methodologies do not reduce or prevent school failure. Perhaps the real limitation is the inability to identify the true reasons that may explain it or ignore/undervalue the problem. In our opinion, one of the current constraints of the teaching/learning process is the excess of and inadequate bibliography recommended by the teacher, which results in continuous student difficulties and waste of time in searching and selecting useful information. The need to change the paradigm of the teaching/learning process comes also from employers. They claim forensic experts armed with useful knowledge to face professional life. It is therefore mandatory to identify the new needs and opportunities regarding pedagogical methodologies. This article reflects on the recent importance of peer review in teaching/learning forensic sciences based on the last 10 years of pedagogical experience inseparably from the scientific activity.",1911722221; 1964210497,Ricardo Jorge Dinis-Oliveira; Teresa Magalhães

One of the project goals was to follow an Open Science approach in all stages. This turned out to be a challenging task as the project involved huge amounts of software, acoustical measurements, and data from listening tests. On the other hand, it was obvious from the positive experience with the Auditory Modelling Toolbox that an Open Science approach would have a positive impact and foster progression afterwards. As there existed no ready solution to achieve this goal at the beginning of the project, different paths for data management were tested. It was especially challenging to provide a solution for data storage. Here, the goal was not only the long term accessibility of the data, but also the revision control of public and private data for the development inside the project.

Based on a survey of life science researchers in Denmark, we found that a substantial proportion of scientists were skeptical about the impact of university patenting. The most skeptical respondents were scientists oriented towards basic research (particularly the less productive ones), recipients of research council grants, scientists with close relations to industry, and full professors. Highly productive scientists were less concerned. Our results have implications for understanding the ultimate success or failure of academic patenting policies, including how increased university patenting may be affecting how scientists conduct academic research.",2159263438; 2329115644; 2099728887,Lee Davis; Maria Theresa Larsen; Peter Lotz

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have also demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos. We discuss the FCP and INDI in the context of these challenges, highlighting the promise of current initiatives and suggesting solutions for possible pitfalls.",2106008186; 875992246; 2166837580; 2686101690,Maarten Mennes; Bharat B.

Efforts at present are focused on the usability of the data in education. The data will be accompanied by example applications tailored for different levels of access, including ready-to-use web-based applications for histogramming or visualising individual collision events and a virtual machine image of the CMS software environment that is compatible with these data. The virtual machine image will contain instructions for using the data with the online applications as well as examples of simple analyses. The novelty of this initiative is two-fold: in terms of open science, it lies in releasing the data in a format that is good for analysis; from an outreach perspective, it is to provide the possibility for people outside CMS to build educational applications using our public data.

The rationale for preprint servers is fundamentally simple: to make the results of research available to the scientific community as soon as possible, instead of waiting until the peer-review process is fully completed. Sharing manuscripts using preprint servers has numerous advantages, including: 1) rapid dissemination of work-in-progress to a wider audience; 2) immediate visibility of the research output for early-career scientists; 3) improved peer review by encouraging feedback from the entire research community; and 4) a fair and straightforward way to establish precedence.

Open preprint servers offer a great opportunity for open science, especially if the community embraces the idea of discussing preprints. Initiatives like Haldane's Sieve (http://haldanessieve.org/), a new blog discussing arXiv papers in population genetics, can help make arXiv attractive for scientists looking to promote their work [1]. These initiatives are important to fully exploit the potential of open preprint servers. Posting preprints online increases the community of available informal peer reviewers, and uses the internet for its original community-building purposes.

Preprints began to gain popularity 20 years ago with the advent of arXiv, an open preprint server widely used in physics and mathematics [2]. Preprints are also integral to the culture of other scientific fields. Paul Krugman noted that, in economics, the “traditional model of submit, get refereed, publish, and then people will read your work broke down a long time ago. In fact, it had more or less fallen apart by the early 80 s” [3]. In addition to a section on arXiv, economists have the RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) initiative, which aims to create an archive of working papers, manuscripts, and book chapters.

Despite the success of this approach in other fields, most manuscripts in biology are not posted to preprint servers and are therefore not seen by more than a handful of other scientists prior to publication. In this article, we highlight the advantages of open preprint servers for both scientists and publishers, discuss the preprint policies of major publishers in biology, and describe the main options to publish preprints (Box 1, Table 1).

An application profile, based on the Dublin Core standard, has been developed by the eBank-UK project for the initial construction of a federation of crystallography data repositories. Building on this initial deployment the eCrystals Federation will then work closely with the OAI-ORE team, as part of a wider international consortium funded by Microsoft to support the whole lifecycle of chemistry research data, to develop a more effective protocol for interoperability between data repositories and the construction of tools and third party services based on the data federation. The groundwork to establish a repository network will be described together with the evolving advocacy program, links with third party services such as data centres, publishers, learned societies, and preservation/sustainability activity.

Although the emerging interest of developing countries in these topics is evident, much work has to be done to promote the national scientific production and the availability of scientific contents without restrictions. As a vehicle for knowledge sharing, National Research and Education Networks (NRENs) play a key role in science growth and Open Access (OA) deployment. In addition, the Current Research Information System (CRIS) has emerged as an embracing paradigm for managing the multitude of science components and players. Instantiating these concepts and directives in the science ecosystems of developing countries will allow to save years of progress, bringing these countries directly into a high-level regarding science management. In this context, taking Mozambique as a case study, this work discusses the problematic of science growth in developing countries and identifies hurdles and strategies for building OA repositories supported by the Mozambican NREN MoRENet, and for implementing technological platforms for managing science. The evaluative open science service model here proposed, aiming at empowering the evolution of knowledge in Mozambique, is sustained by the study of international directives regarding NRENs and OA, CRIS trends, and the Mozambican science and education ecosystem.",207549156; 2154089976; 2056149527,Marangaze Munhepe Mulhanga; Solange Rito Lima; Venancio Massingue

Responsible conduct of research is often defined in terms of a set of abstract, normative principles, professional standards, and ethics in doing research. In order to accommodate the normative principles of scientific research, the professional standards, and a researcher’s moral principles, transparent research practices can serve as a framework for responsible conduct of research. We suggest a “prune-and-add” project structure to enhance transparency and, by extension, responsible conduct of research. Questionable research practices are defined as practices that are detrimental to the research process. The prevalence of questionable research practices remains largely unknown, and reproducibility of findings has been shown to be problematic. Questionable practices are discouraged by transparent practices because practices that arise from them will become more apparent to scientific peers. Most effective might be preregistrations of research design, hypotheses, and analyses, which reduce particularism of results by providing an a priori research scheme. Research misconduct has been defined as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP), which is clearly the worst type of research practice. Despite it being clearly wrong, it can be approached from a scientific and legal perspective. The legal perspective sees research misconduct as a form of white-collar crime. The scientific perspective seeks to answer the following question: “Were results invalidated because of the misconduct?” We review how misconduct is typically detected, how its detection can be improved, and how prevalent it might be. Institutions could facilitate detection of data fabrication and falsification by implementing data auditing. Nonetheless, the effect of misconduct is pervasive: many retracted articles are still cited after the retraction has been issued. Main points Researchers systematically evaluate their own conduct as more responsible than colleagues, but not as responsible as they would like. Transparent practices, facilitated by the Open Science Framework, help embody scientific norms that promote responsible conduct. Questionable research practices harm the research process and work counter to the generally accepted scientific norms, but are hard to detect. Research misconduct requires active scrutiny of the research community because editors and peer-reviewers do not pay adequate attention to detecting this. Tips are given on how to improve your detection of potential problems.",2019250667; 2715086926,C.H.J. Hartgerink; Jelte

Experimental integrity can be compromised inadvertently when researchers overlook some important component of their experimental procedure, or intentionally by researchers or malicious third-parties who are biased towards ensuring a specific outcome of an experiment. The scientific community has pushed for ""open science"" to add transparency to the experimental process, asking researchers to publicly register their data sets and experimental procedures. We argue that the software engineering community can leverage its expertise in tracking traceability and provenance of source code and its related artifacts to simplify data management for scientists. Moreover, by leveraging smart contract and blockchain technologies, we believe that it is possible for such a system to guarantee end-to-end integrity of scientific data and results while supporting collaborative research.",2731697239; 168727994; 2728879292; 2251358113,Jonathan Bell; Thomas D.

The former topic drives attention on academics’ new practices in digital, open and networked contexts; the second is focused on the requirements and strategies to promote academics’ professional learning and career advancement. The research question addressing this study is: are faculty development strategies hindered by the lack of a cohesive view in the research on digital scholarship? The main assumption guiding this research question is that clear conceptual frameworks and models of professional practice lead to effective faculty development strategies. Through a wide overview of the evolution of both digital scholarship and faculty development, followed by a conceptual analysis of the intersections between fields, the paper attempts to show the extent on which the situation in one area (digital scholarship) might encompass criticalities for the other (faculty development) in terms of research and practices. Furthermore, three scenarios based on the several perspectives of digital scholarship are built in order to explore the research question in depth. We conclude that at the current state of art the relationship between these two topics is weak. Moreover, the dialogue between digital scholarship and faculty development could put the basis to forge effective professional learning contexts and instruments, with the ultimate goal of supporting academics to become digital scholars towards a more open and democratic vision of scholarship.",1923990537,Juliana Elisa Raffaghelli

More than two decades after the Brundtland report and UNCED Earth summit, the world has now adopted Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Rather than a cause for celebration, this delay should encourage reflection on the role of research in society. Why is it so difficult to realize sustainability in practice? The answer lies in the fact that universities and research centres persist with 19th century methods of data gathering, scholarly analysis, and journal articles. Today’s world needs science in real-time, whether to detect drought, confront Ebola, or assist refugees. Research needs to work faster and embrace 21st century practices including data science, open access, and infographics. A silent revolution is occurring in the ways of organizing and conducting research, enabled by new technology and encouraging work that tackles the key challenges facing society. A variety of new arrangements have come into existence that promote international collaboration, including Horizon 2020 with its emphasis on societal challenges, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation which has inspired a family of grand challenges funds on health and development, and the Future Earth joint program of research for global sustainability. These arrangements not only control billions of dollars in research funding, they also influence the strategies of national research councils and international organizations. The result is no less than a transformation in the incentives that reward how researchers invest their time and effort. Why is a revolution needed? Within research, substantial growth in knowledge production coincided with fragmentation among disciplines. One can easily find expertise and publications in soil science or agronomy, yet integrated efforts on food security and climate adaptation remain scarce. Beyond research, society remains largely uninformed, as academics avoid engaging in public debate or policy advice. Research often fails to raise public awareness or inform practitioners regarding the issues facing society and the options for responding to them. For example, research on food security can and must go beyond quantifying how many people are hungry or undernourished. Society needs solutions that connect changes in farm-level production, to how the market mediates access to food, and the ultimate health outcomes among citizens. The emerging vision is one where research helps society understand and respond to global problems. Research that is ‘fit-for-purpose’ demonstrates an ability to bridge ingenuity gaps, address grand challenges, and foster social resilience. Ingenuity gaps concern the knowledge needed to address rising complexity and new vulnerabilities introduced by globalization and technological change. Grand challenges describe a shift in the scale, scope, and ambition of research objectives. Social resilience refer to society's ability to cope with stress and reinvent itself in response to shocks and pressures. In short, together these attributes describe an expectation that research helps society to 'mind the gap', 'think big', and 'bounce'. Research needs to speak back to society. While the journal article and scholarly publications remain important determinants of a research career, they are increasingly supplemented by attention to data visualization, social media, and research impact. Research still needs rigour: deep knowledge of theory and data, and how to uncover patterns and establish explanation. Scientists have a long history of using pie charts, line graphs, and network diagrams to communicate among themselves. Yet research also needs a keen sense of design: an appreciation for how to convey relationships, categories, and magnitude through the creative use of lines, colours, symbols, position and size. Evidence-based illustrations, or infographics, convey complex issues in greater depth than long reports or TV commentaries. Research tells a story: starting with a compelling problem or question, and using data to provide perspective. Rather than offer society potential solutions or policy recommendations, newer techniques allow anyone to interact with data to create their own visualizations and test hypotheses “on demand”. In summary, there is a silent revolution in research for sustainability. Research is expected to help understand and address the problems facing society. The opportunities to engage in research are shifting, rewarding those who are embrace the practices of open science and data, those who are connected to international scientific networks, and those that help society to better understand and solve global problems.

Detailed data on the decisions of 1,694 bio-scientists allow to detect similarities and differences between academia-based and industry-based scientists. Arguments from social capital theory are applied to explain why individuals share information even at (temporary) personal cost. In both realms, the results suggest that the likelihood of sharing decreases with the competitive value of the requested information. Factors related to social capital, i.e., expected reciprocity and the extent to which a scientist’s community conforms to the norm of open science, either directly affect information-sharing or moderate competitive interest considerations on information-sharing. The effect depends on the system to which a scientist belongs.",2062945787,Carolin Haeussler

An e-survey was designed to provide insight into respondent’s current and future engagement with science communication activities. Respondents provided a wide range of ideas and concerns as to the ‘common practice’ of academic science communication, and whilst they support some of these popular approaches (such as open-door events and science festivals), there are alternatives that may enable wider engagement. Suggestions of internet-based approaches and digital media were strongly encouraged, and although respondents found merits in methods such as science festivals, limitations such as geography, time and topic of interest were a barrier to engagement for some. Academics and scientists need to think carefully about how they plan their science communication activities and carry out evaluations, including considering the point of view of the public, as although defaulting to hands-on open door events at their university may seem like the expected standard, it may not be the best way to reach the intended audience.",2154643821; 1901784002; 1711980007,James Redfern; Samuel Illingworth; Joanna Verran

An example is the Open Science Grid (OSG) project, which currently experiences a roughly 15% job failure rate. This can be an issue not only for Grid computing but for anyone performing large-scale data transfers to remote machines because of the large number of interconnected components and services. As part of the Center for Enabling Distributed Petascale Science (CEDPS) project we have been building an infrastructure to work with current middleware and existing system tools to more easily track failures and discover anomalous behavior. This consists of a common logging format, the extension of syslog-ng for centralized collection of data, a data summarizer to more easily manage the volume of logging, and an anomaly detection system that can connect to a warning system when unexpected behaviors occur. We are currently working with OSG to deploy a prototype of the full system. The initial logs gathered will be used to extend the analysis tools and to increase the reliability of the services for the SciDAC end user community.",2033317035; 2169563905; 2157603748,Brian Tierney; Dan Gunter; Jennifer M.

His claim has been widely cited. It also seems consistent with the findings of the Open Science Collaboration Project that a majority of psychological studies could not be replicated. In this article, I argue (1) that Ioannidis' claim has limited relevance for social psychology and (2) that mass replication does not allow general conclusions about the validity of social psychological research. Ioannidis´ claim is valid only for one-shot studies without replication and with a low a priori probability that the tested hypothesis is true. Mass replication provides limited information about the validity of social psychological research, because failures to replicate do not prove that the original finding is invalid. More conclusive information is provided by meta-analytic tests of social psychological theories. Implications for research in social psychology are discussed.",1668114552,Wolfgang Stroebe

A deep reflection on the current needs of the agents involved that takes into account key issues such as the inclusion of citizens in the creation and consumption of the cultural resources offered, the volume and complexity of datasets, available infrastructures, etcetera, is necessary. Present technologies make it possible to achieve projects that were impossible until recently, but the field is currently facing the challenge of proposing frameworks and systems to generalize and reproduce these proposals in other knowledge domains with similar but heterogeneous data sets. The track ""New trends in digital humanities"" of the Fourth International Conference on Technological Ecosystems for Enhancing Multiculturality (TEEM 2016), tries to set the basis of good practice in digital humanities by reflecting on models, technologies and methods to carry the transformation out.",1916366858; 2297208394,Roberto Therón; Eveline Wandl-Vogt

Many scientific workflows have intensive resource requirements. Therefore, different distributed platforms, including campus clusters, grids and clouds are used for efficient execution of these workflows. In this paper we examine the performance and the cost of running the Pegasus Workflow Management System (Pegasus WMS) implementation of blast2cap3, the protein-guided assembly approach, on three different execution platforms: Sandhills, the University of Nebraska Campus Cluster, the academic grid Open Science Gird (OSG), and the commercial cloud Amazon EC2. Furthermore, the behavior of the blast2cap3 workflow was tested with different number of tasks. For the used workflows and execution platforms, we perform multiple runs in order to compare the total workflow running time, as well as the different resource availability over time. Additionally, for the most interesting runs, the number of running versus the number of idle jobs over time was analyzed for each platform. The performed experiments show that using the Pegasus WMS implementation of blast2cap3 with more than 100 tasks significantly reduces the running time for all execution platforms. In general, for our workflow, better performance and resource usage were achieved when Amazon EC2 was used as an execution platform. However, due to the Amazon EC2 cost, the academic distributed systems can sometimes be a good alternative and have excellent performance, especially when there are plenty of resources available.",322676148; 7791215; 2147107919; 2144498669; 2071234966; 335256981,Natasha Pavlovikj; Kevin Begcy; Sairam Behera; Malachy T.

Using a exploratory approach, the study tested whether a consensus exists among advocates of these initiatives about the key concepts, exploring the meanings that scientists attach to the various mechanisms for sharing their work, and the social context in which this takes place. The study used a purposive sampling strategy to target scientists who have been active participants in these advocacy efforts, and an open-ended questionnaire to collect detailed opinions on the topics of reproducibility, credibility, scooping, data sharing, results sharing, and the effectiveness of the peer review process. We found evidence of a lack of agreement on the meaning of key terminology, and a lack of consensus on some of the broader goals of these advocacy efforts. These results can be explained through a closer examination of the divergent goals and approaches adopted by different advocacy efforts. We suggest that the scientific community could benefit from a broader discussion of what it means to make scientific research more accessible and how this might best be achieved.",2135122503; 329574911,Alicia M.

OA’s main function is to be found somewhere else, namely in the ability to subvert the power to control science’s governance and its future directions (Open Science), a power that is more often found within the academic institutions rather than outside. By decentralising and opening-up not just the way in which scholarship is published but also the way in which it is assessed, OA removes the barriers that helped turn science into an intellectual oligopoly even before an economic one. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate that Open Access is a key enabler of Open Science, which in turn will lead to a more Open Society. Furthermore, the paper argues that while legislative interventions play an important role in the top-down regulation of Open Access, legislators currently lack an informed and systematic vision on the role of Open Access in science and society. In this historical phase, other complementary forms of intervention (bottom-up) appear much more “informed” and effective. This paper, which intends to set the stage for future research, identifies a few pieces of the puzzle: the relationship between formal and informal norms in the field of Open Science and how these impact on intellectual property rights, the protection of personal data, the assessment of science and the technology employed for the communication of science.",1892964517; 2111890350; 1998237228; 1350358231; 101859111,Thomas Margoni; Roberto Caso; Rossana Ducato; Paolo Guarda; Valentina Moscon

But what lies beyond IP? A new literature on “intellectual production without IP” (or “IP without IP”) has emerged to explore this question, but its examples and explanations have yet to convince skeptics. This Article reorients this new literature via a study of a hard case: a global influenza virus-sharing network that has for decades produced critically important information goods, at significant expense, and in a loose-knit group — all without recourse to IP. I analyze the Network as an example of “open science,” a mode of information production that differs strikingly from conventional IP, and yet that successfully produces important scientific goods in response to social need. The theory and example developed here refute the most powerful criticisms of the emerging “IP without IP” literature, and provide a stronger foundation for this important new field. Even where capital costs are high, creation without IP can be reasonably effective in social terms, if it can link sources of funding to reputational and evaluative feedback loops like those that characterize open science. It can also be sustained over time, even by loose-knit groups and where the stakes are high, because organizations and other forms of law can help to stabilize cooperation. I also show that contract law is well suited to modes of information production that rely upon a “supply side” rather than “demand side” model. In its most important instances, “order without IP” is not order without governance, nor order without law. Recognizing this can help us better ground this new field, and better study and support forms of knowledge production that deserve our attention, and that sometimes sustain our very lives.",1984339762,Amy Kapczynski

Approximately 400 researchers submit an abstract each conference, half of which are accepted.

The purpose of this thesis is to investigate which variables increase or decrease an abstract’s probability of getting accepted. The Focus here lies on whether the author’s origin, that is if he or she is from a developed or developing country, has any effect on the level of acceptance. Also studied is if reviewers grade abstracts differently depending on whether the author is of the same origin as the reviewer or not, and in turn if the reviewing process suffers from a geographical-political bias. We conclude that there is no evidence for such a bias; however the chance of getting accepted is significantly lower if the author is from a developing country.

Several other variables are investigated in this report, only some of which are significant. A final model is also received from a binary logistic regression, describing the best way to write an abstract in order to be accepted.",2105690860; 2167168508,Emmy Westerdahl; Sanna Håkansson

In this case study I have examined openness strategies, practices and attitudes in two open collaboration research projects created by Finnish researchers, in order to understand what made them resistant to the fear of scooping. The radically open approach of the projects includes open by default funding proposals, co-authorship and community membership. Primary sources used are interviews of the projects’ founding members. The analysis indicates that openness requires trust in close peers, but not necessarily in research community or society at large. Based on the case study evidence, focusing on intrinsic goals, like new knowledge and bringing about ethical reform, instead of external goals such as publications, supports openness. Understanding fundaments of science, philosophy of science and research ethics, can also have a beneficial effect on willingness to share. Whether there are aspects in open sharing that makes it seem riskier from the point of view of certain demographical groups within research community, such as women, could be worth closer inspection.",1918640562,Heidi Laine

The debate over biotechnology intellectual property policy seems intractable. Instrumentalists dicker about how to tweak incentives in order to produce the best mix of innovation and disclosure, without stepping back to ask whether the consequentialist approach is best on a broad scale. Hegelians seem to have little to say about biotechnology, given that researchers seem to bear little resemblance to the artists and poets who most obviously pour their personalities into their work. Postmodern critics offer some trenchant critiques of the current system, but suggest few alternatives that could be realized in contemporary biotechnology. Perhaps the biotechnology ""thicket"" has as much to do with these conflicting underlying philosophies of intellectual property as it does with individual patent rights that must be cleared to conduct research in this field. Virtue ethics may illuminate a path forward. By situating biotechnology as a community dedicated to human flourishing, and focusing on the practices that move that community ever towards its goal, the assumptions and language we use to describe biotechnology intellectual property policy may begin to change. As these assumptions begin to change, perhaps a move towards a more open community of biotechnological science will also become more tractable.",2343924790,David W. Opderbeck

In the UK and the Netherlands, national OA mandates require the scientific community to seriously consider publishing research outputs in OA forms. At the same time, other elements of Open Science are becoming also part of the debate, thus including not only publishing research outputs but also other related aspects of the chain of scientific knowledge production such as open peer review and open data. From a research management point of view, it is important to keep track of the progress made in the OA publishing debate. Until now, this has been quite problematic, given the fact that OA as a topic is hard to grasp by bibliometric methods, as most databases supporting bibliometric data lack exhaustive and accurate open access labelling of scientific publications. In this study, we present a methodology that systematically creates OA labels for large sets of publications processed in the Web of Science database.

This challenge is particularly acute at the moment with ‘Open Science’ one of the hottest topics around with organisations and funders from the G81 downwards stressing the importance of open data in driving everything from global innovation through to more accountable governance; not to mention the more direct possibility that non-compliance could result in research grant income drying up. There is a need to work with those researchers that need support to develop research data management processes and infrastructures that complement their ways of working and not just impose box-ticking exercises. We will explain the strategies, systems developed, and concerns arising to date at our two Universities to help support researchers and managers in this (r)evolution.",2003496240; 2343092965,Anna Clements; Valerie McCutcheon

These challenging calculations include complicated geometries and require significant computational resources to complete. As a result, a question arises as to the level of convergence of the calculations with Monte Carlo simulation particle count. In the Trinity Open Science calculations, one main focus was to investigate convergence of the relevant simulation quantities with Monte Carlo particle count to assess the current simulation methodology. Both for this application space but also of more general applicability, we also investigated the impact of code algorithms on parallel scaling on the Trinity machine as well as the utilization of the Trinity DataWarp burst buffer technology in Mercury via the LLNL Scalable Checkpoint/Restart (SCR) library.",2638370033; 2497076019; 2707853457; 2638458963; 2646344220; 2501145765; 2640724958; 2089235527; 2158044129,Patrick S.

The general idea of establishing an open source community dedicated to software for scientific applications was understood and appreciated by most people. However, the lack of a precise definition of goals and scope is a limiting factor that has also made many people sceptical of the initiative. In order to understand more precisely what such an open source initiative should do and how, EMI has started a more formal feasibility study around a concept called ScienceSoft — Open Software for Open Science. A group of people from interested parties was created in December 2011 to be the ScienceSoft Steering Committee with the short-term mandate to formalize the discussions about the initiative and produce a document with an initial high-level description of the motivations, issues and possible solutions and a general plan to make it happen. The conclusions of the initial investigation were presented at CERN in February 2012 at a ScienceSoft Workshop organized by EMI. Since then, presentations of ScienceSoft have been made in various occasions, in Amsterdam in January 2012 at the EGI Workshop on Sustainability, in Taipei in February at the ISGC 2012 conference, in Munich in March at the EGI/EMI Conference and at OGF 34 in March.

We describe here recent developments in this field starting with the revelation that the popular Job plot method is inappropriate for most problems in host–guest chemistry and that the focus should instead be on systematically fitting data and testing all reasonable binding models. We then discuss approaches for estimating uncertainties in binding studies using case studies and simulations to highlight key issues. Related to this is the need for ready access to data and transparency in the methodology or software used, and we demonstrate an example a webportal (supramolecular.org) that aims to address this issue. We conclude with a list of best-practice protocols for data analysis in supramolecular chemistry that could easily be translated to other related problems in chemistry including measuring rate constants or drug IC50 values.",2151019866; 1968593202,D.

In particular, we analyse the micro-level interactions to point out the different network structures shaped by university-owned and university-invented patents. We detected three subnetwork typologies (labelled type A, B, and C) that exemplify different qualitative relational structures as well as different attributions to propriety rights. Type A (open science) exemplifies the typical owned patent; type B (multiple ties) represents the hybrid structure with multiple ties and involvement of academics as individuals and of universities as organisation; type C (disconnected subnetworks) represents the typical invented patent with no role of universities as organisation. The whole network seems to show a breaking point in terms of connectivity around 2005, a year that marks a change in policy rule and strategic orientation of Italian universities towards patenting. After 2005, the number of actors grew disproportionally and the network appears disconnected in several comparable components. Also, the composition in terms of subnetwork types changed. The overall picture seems to underline a big structural change dominated by the important increase of academic patenting both direct (university ownership) and indirect (increasing academic patenting).",1958583172; 2127156440,Saveria Capellari; Domenico De Stefano

This work presents an algorithm that dynamically schedules tasks of workflows to Grid sites based on the performance of these sites when running previous jobs from the same workflow. The algorithm captures the dynamic characteristics of Grid environments without the need to probe the remote sites. We evaluated the algorithm running a workflow in the Open Science Grid using twelve sites. The results showed improvements up to 150% relative to other four usual scheduling strategies.,2121925308; 2671088666; 2307871414; 2242263115; 2126999322; 2017222965,Luiz A. V. C.

It is primarily, although not exclusively, funded by government and nonprofit sources. Much of it is produced at academic research centers, although some academic science is proprietary and some privately funded R&D enters the science commons. Science in general aspires to Mertonian norms of openness, universality, objectivity, and critical inquiry. The science commons diverges from proprietary science primarily in being open and being very broadly available. These features make the science commons particularly valuable for advancing knowledge, for training innovators who will ultimately work in both public and private sectors, and in providing a common stock of knowledge upon which all players—both public and private—can draw readily. Open science plays two important roles that proprietary R&D cannot: it enables practical benefits even in the absence of profitable markets for goods and services, and its lays a shared foundation for subsequent private R&D. The history of genomics in the period 1992–2004, covering two periods when genomic startup firms attracted significant private R&D investment, illustrates these features of how a science commons contributes value. Commercial interest in genomics was intense during this period. Fierce competition between private sector and public sector genomics programs was highly visible. Seemingly anomalous behavior, such as private firms funding “open science,” can be explained by unusual business dynamics between established firms wanting to preserve a robust science commons to prevent startup firms from limiting established firms’ freedom to operate. Deliberate policies to create and protect a large science commons were pursued by nonprofit and government funders of genomics research, such as the Wellcome Trust and National Institutes of Health. These policies were crucial to keeping genomic data and research tools widely available at low cost.",2027467733,Robert Cook-Deegan

The scale, investment and organization of it are being compared to the Human Genome Project (HGP), which has exemplified ‘big science’ for biology. In line with the trend towards Big Data in genomic research, the promise of the BRAIN Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project, rests on the possibility to amass vast quantities of data to model the complex interactions between the brain and behaviour and inform the diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. Advocates of this ‘data driven’ paradigm in neuroscience argue that harnessing the large quantities of data generated across laboratories worldwide has numerous methodological, ethical and economic advantages, but it requires the neuroscience community to adopt a culture of data sharing and open access to benefit from them. In this article, we examine the rationale for data sharing among advocates and briefly exemplify these in terms of new ‘open neuroscience’ projects. Then, drawing on the frequently invoked model of data sharing in genomics, we go on to demonstrate the complexities of data sharing, shedding light on the sociological and ethical challenges within the realms of institutions, researchers and participants, namely dilemmas around public/private interests in data, (lack of) motivation to share in the academic community, and potential loss of participant anonymity. Our paper serves to highlight some foreseeable tensions around data sharing relevant to the emergent ‘open neuroscience’ movement.",2291153131; 2118505491; 2140400975; 2302370543,Suparna Choudhury; Jennifer R.

This paper aims to describe the evolution of scientific communication, largely represented by the publication process. It notes the disappearance of the traditional publication on paper and its progressive replacement by electronic publishing, a new paradigm implying radical changes in the whole mechanism. It aims also at warning the scientific community about the dangers of some new avenues and why, rather than subcontracting an essential part of its work, it must take back full control of its production.




Design/methodology/approach




The paper reviews the emerging concepts in scholarly publication and aims to answer frequently asked questions concerning free access to scientific literature as well as to data, science and knowledge in general.




Findings




The paper provides new observations concerning the level of compliance to institutional open access mandates and the poor relevance of journal prestige for quality evaluation of research and researchers. The results of introducing an open access policy at the University of Liege are noted.




Social implications




Open access is, for the first time in human history, an opportunity to provide free access to knowledge universally, regardless of either the wealth or the social status of the potentially interested readers. It is an essential breakthrough for developing countries.




Originality/value




Open access and Open Science in general must be considered as common values that should be shared freely. Free access to publicly generated knowledge should be explicitly included in universal human rights. There are still a number of obstacles hampering this goal, mostly the greed of intermediaries who persuade researchers to give their work for free, in exchange for prestige. The worldwide cause of Open Knowledge is thus a major universal issue for the twenty-first century.",2010833505,Bernard Rentier

ReSS integrates standard Grid tools such as Condor, as a brokering service and the gLite CEMon, for gathering and publishing resource information in GLUE Schema format. ReSS is used in OSG by Virtual Organizations (VO) such as Dark Energy Survey (DES), DZero and Engagement VO. ReSS is also used as a Resource Selection Service for Campus Grids, such as FermiGrid. VOs use ReSS to automate the resource selection in their workload management system to run jobs over the grid. In the past year, the system has been enhanced to enable publication and selection of storage resources and of any special software or software libraries (like MPI libraries) installed at computing resources.

A core work of many postgraduate certificate in teaching and learning (PGCert) courses for new lecturers, it is studied, in the main, as a means to understand how to support and encourage students to achieve more effective learning. Communities of practice can also be applied to academics. In the context of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) and its predecessors, the gulf between research-focused and teaching-Focused academics in life sciences has widened, so that in many institutions, these two groups have evolved into two distinct communities of practice; one whose priority is disciplinary research, the other’s learning and teaching. However, in 2015, the UK government announced that a Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) would be introduced into higher education in England, as early as 2017. While the exact details of TEF remain unclear, it is certain that “excellence” and “student satisfaction” will be high on the agenda. It is vital, therefore, that the two communities of practice, research-focused and teaching-focused, find ways to come together in order to ensure high quality teaching and learning. Wenger proposes that this can be done through the process of “brokering”, which allows expertise from both communities of practice to cross from one to the other, strengthening both. This should be encouraged at departmental and institutional level, but another vital origin of brokering can be forged at a(n) (inter)national level at meetings such as the SEB Annual Conference, where teaching-focused academics have the opportunity to mix with research-active colleagues. While this paper is informed by recent and current events in the UK Higher Education sector, it is of interest to academics who work in an environment where research and teaching have become separate to any extent.",2123653210,Anne Tierney

By aggregating resources and expertise at the institutional level it will be possible to create distributed technical and support operations that provide faculty and students with methods to leverage a much larger and robust set of resources. Partnering with Internet2, the consortium will use the Innovation Platform to connect campuses and allow high performance interconnections through Science DMZs that can be built and broken down in ad-hoc ways using SDN. The ability to develop these network connections, coupled with the project's community building characteristics, will be a model for ""team science"" that can be extended and replicated nationally. By leveraging existing local and national computing resources (XSEDE and Open Science Grid), we will enable science and education deployments that are not possible today, making complex collaborations with computational needs routine. This project will be transformative for campus IT and will create a community of practitioners that shares resources, experience, and expertise to facilitate new knowledge and discovery.",2228036545; 2224254961; 1990426443; 2159657741; 377639615,James B.

As anyone who has written an article collaboratively knows, there are numerous ways a manuscript can be written to convey the same general ideas. To aid with this, many scientific writing books and editorials provide advice, often anecdotal, on how to make articles more memorable. Here I ground these suggestions with empirical support from memory research. Specifically, I suggest that researchers consider how to emphasize their work’s novelty, strive to describe their work using concrete, easy-to-understand terms, and use caution when attempting to evoke an emotional response in the reader. I also discuss considerations in title selections and conference presentations.",2107683368,Christopher R. Madan

Our study adds to the limited evidence on this topic with an empirical investigation based on a panel data set for a broad sample of university researchers. Results suggest that publication and patenting are complementary, not substitute, activities for faculty members. This is not consistent with recent concerns regarding deleterious effects of patenting on the research output of faculty members. Average citations to publications, however, appear to decline for repeat patenters, suggesting either a decrease in quality or restrictions on use associated in patent protection.",2069852282; 2142552712,Kira R.

While knowledgebases play an increasingly important role in the scientific community, the question of their sustainability is raised due to the growth of biomedical literature. By using UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot as a case study, we address this question by using different literature triage approaches. With the assistance of the PubTator text-mining tool, we tagged more than 10,000 articles to assess the ratio of papers relevant for curation. We first show that curators read and evaluate many more papers than they curate, and that measuring the number of curated publications is insufficient to provide a complete picture. We show that a large fraction of published papers found in PubMed is not relevant for curation in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot and demonstrate that, despite appearances, expert curation is sustainable.",1970781481; 1972682459; 2692381839; 2086987877; 2120643991; 2711168698; 2272133122; 1957213110; 2727909943; 1971852440,Sylvain Poux; Bernd Roechert; Cecilia N.

DTL is a new national organisation in scientific research that facilitates life scientists with technologies and technological expertise in an era where new projects often are data-intensive, multi-disciplinary, and multi-site. It is run as a lean not-for-profit organisation with research organisations (both academic and industrial) as paying members. The small staff of the organisation undertakes a variety of tasks that are necessary to perform or support modern academic research, but that are not easily undertaken in a purely academic setting. DTL Data takes care of such tasks related to data stewardship, facilitating exchange of knowledge and expertise, and brokering access to e-infrastructure. DTL also represents the Netherlands in ELIXIR, the European infrastructure for life science data. The organisation is still being fine-tuned and this will continue over time, as it is crucial for this kind of organisation to adapt to a constantly changing environment.

Disciplinary knowledge is accumulated in the form of a growing tree-like web of research areas. Knowledge production is sequential since the problems addressed generate new problems that may in turn be handled. This model allows us to study how the reward system in science influences the scientific community in stochastically selecting problems at each period. Long term evolution and generic features of the emerging disciplines as well as relative efficiency of problem selection are analyzed.,1682540667; 2034495586,Nicolas Carayol; Jean-Michel Dalle

At its most complete, the philosophy of ‘open science’ commits researchers to revealing and sharing the entirety of their practice: questions, data, methodologies, results, models, speculations, wrong turns and all (Nielsen, 2009). Open practice has the power to reveal formerly closed and silent parts of the scientific process, so that anyone, from professional colleagues to interested members of the public (at least, those with internet access), can have direct, unmediated access to research: can indeed ‘have it all’.

Open Science is not new, it was the bedrock on which the scientific revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries were built. Its open publication of scientific concepts and the evidence (the data) on which they were based allowed scrutiny of the logic of an argument and replication of observations or experiments or their refutation. It has been the basis of so-called “scientific self-correction”. But the technological revolution of recent decades has produced an unprecedented explosion in the human capacity to acquire, store and manipulate data and information and to instantaneously communicate them globally, irrespective of location. It has produced fundamental changes in human, social and economic behaviour and has implications for research and learning that are far more profound and pervasive than those that followed Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press, including the way that science engages with the wider community. But the explosion of data is also undermining self-correction through the difficulty of making large volumes of supporting data concurrently available in a scrutinisable form, risking both the method of science and its credibility. This poses a major challenge for modern science to stimulate open release and sharing of data in ways that also facilitate new modes of collaboration and that increase creativity through interaction of many brains and many communities unbounded by institutional walls. We need to challenge and re-define many of the habits and norms of researchers and their institutions if the research community if it is to exploit technological opportunities, maintain self-correction and maximize the contribution of research to human understanding and welfare. Fortunately the response to these imperatives is growing, through the enunciation of principles for open science, the development of procedures and tools and the engagement of researchers, universities, funders, publishers, learned societies and governments.",2019286018,Geoffrey Boulton

Bibliometric evaluation versus informed peer review in the Italian research assessment exercise"". Our paper analyzed results of the experiment conducted by the Italian governmental agency ANVUR during the research assessment exercise about the agreement between informed peer review (IR) and bibliometrics. We argued that according to available statistical guidelines, results of the experiment are indicative of a poor agreement in all research fields with only one exception, results reached in the so called Area 13 (economics and statistics). We argued that this difference was due to the changes introduced in Area 13 with respect to the protocol adopted in all the other areas. Bertocchi et al.'s comment dismiss our explanation and suggest that the difference was due to ""differences in the evaluation processes between Area 13 and other areas"". In addition, they state that all our five claims about Area 13 experiment protocol ""are either incorrect or not based on any evidence"". Based on textual evidence drawn from ANVUR official reports, we show that: (1) none of the four differences listed by Bertocchi et al. is peculiar of Area 13; (2) their five arguments contesting our claims about the experiment protocol are all contradicted by official records of the experiment itself.",2012065263; 111302929,Alberto Baccini; Giuseppe De Nicolao

The study analyzed the articles that addressed this triangle, in order to identify the contexts and challenges that arise in open innovation and the cocreation of knowledge to promote open science. The method was a systematic literature review (SLR) of 168 articles published in open access format, from January 2014 to May 2017 in the Web of Science and Scopus databases. In the validation process, the York University criteria were used: inclusion and exclusion, relevance of the pertinent studies, evaluation of the quality / validity of included studies and description of data / basic studies. The findings showed that the mostwidely publicized contexts were in the United States and Brazil, in the business and academic sectors (closely followed by the social sector), and the challenges were open to innovation, opening and research.

Space probes have visited most parts of that environment providing a wealth of in situ and remote-sensing measurements. Equally important in contributing to the advances made over the last 50 years have been the many instruments, which have been distributed on the surface of the Earth. In particular, the development of networks for the specific purpose of studying the dynamics of geospace, energy redistribution within geospace, and fundamental physical processes in plasmas has been hugely successful. Ground-based instruments remotely sense processes and phenomena in geospace and since this volume is large, networks of such instruments are the best way of measuring the global state of geospace and its dynamics. In this paper, I describe ways in which the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) has contributed to the success of ground-based networks, concentrating on science results, which have required the network approach so well demonstrated by SuperDARN. Such science includes the remote sensing of the reconnection electric field and its dynamics, the study of processes where asymmetries in the geospace system are induced by the external driving forces, and MHD waves, which play an important role in the transfer of energy and momentum within geospace. In addition, I discuss open science questions, which can be addressed by SuperDARN in the future, in particular in conjunction with current and future space missions as well as other ground-based networks.",2109827153,M.

Geoscience is one of the first domains that take lead in initiatives such as open data, open code, open access, and open collections, which comprise key topics of Open Science in academia. The meaning of being open can be understood at two levels. The lower level is to make data, code, sample collections and publications, etc. freely accessible online and allow reuse, modification and sharing. The higher level is the annotation and connection between those resources to establish a network for collaborative scientific research. In the data science component of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), we have leveraged state-of-the-art information technologies and existing online resources to deploy a web portal for the over 1000 researchers in the DCO community. An initial aim of the portal is to keep track of all research and outputs related to the DCO community. Further, we intend for the portal to establish a knowledge network, which supports various stages of an open scientific process within and beyond the DCO community. Annotation and linking are the key characteristics of the knowledge network. Not only are key assets, including DCO data and methods, published in an open and inter-linked fashion, but the people, organizations, groups, grants, projects, samples, field sites, instruments, software programs, activities, meetings, etc. are recorded and connected to each other through relationships based on well-defined, formal conceptual models. The network promotes collaboration among DCO participants, improves the openness and reproducibility of carbon-related research, facilitates accreditation to resource contributors, and eventually stimulates new ideas and findings in deep carbon-related studies.",2153882111; 2144523891; 2046785095; 2124564687; 2534745285; 2654916200; 2698945690; 2689738070; 2102575901,Xiaogang Ma; Patrick West; Stephan Zednik; John S.

Before the deployment of an automated resource selection system, users had to submit jobs directly to these resources. They would manually select a resource and specify all relevant attributes in the job description prior to submitting the job. The necessity of a human intervention in resource selection and attribute specification hinders automated job management components from accessing OSG resources and it is inconvenient for the users. The Resource Selection Service (ReSS) project addresses these shortcomings. The system integrates condor technology, for the core match making service, with the gLite CEMon component, for gathering and publishing resource information in the Glue Schema format. Each one of these components communicates over secure protocols via web services interfaces. The system is currently used in production on OSG by the DZero Experiment, the Engagement Virtual Organization, and the Dark Energy. It is also the resource selection service for the Fermilab Campus Grid, FermiGrid. ReSS is considered a lightweight solution to push-based workload management.

It became a seminal technology for studying the structure of DNA. The story of the creation and dissemination of this technology, which was not patented and was freely distributed throughout the scientific community, stands as a case study in open science. The Southern blot was developed at a time when attitudes about commercial intrusion into health research were beginning to change and the practical value of molecular genetics was becoming apparent to industry. Interest from industry in fundamental molecular biological techniques meant that scientists began to think about commercial uses of their work even in otherwise ""basic"" research. The unpatented Southern blot is contrasted with later patented technologies, particularly microarray methods, which were created in the same environment by many of the same people, but which followed significant changes to UK policies encouraging commercialization of academic research and a norm shift friendlier to such commercialization within academic molecular biology. Professor Southern's personal experience illuminates how the technologies evolved, and his views provide insight into how scientists' attitudes about commercialization have changed.",2430567905; 3883764; 2027467733,Daidree Tofano; Ilse R.

This study, however, focused on less explored themes, namely on alternative funding mechanisms for scientific research and on emerging reputation mechanisms for scholars resulting from Web 2.0 platforms and applications. It has been demonstrated that both are providing significant new opportunities for researchers to disseminate, share, explore and collaborate with other researchers, but it remains to be seen whether they will be able to bring about more disruptive change in how science and research systems function in the future.

The study combines data on scientific co-authorship with data on patent co-invention, at the level of individual researchers, for three science-intensive technology fields, i.e. lasers, semiconductors and biotechnology, in order to assess the extent of the overlap between the two communities and to identify the role of key individuals in the process of knowledge transfer. Our findings reveal that the extent of the connectedness among scientists and inventors is rather large, and that particular individuals, i.e. authors-inventors, who act as gatekeepers and bridge the boundaries between the two domains, are fundamental to ensuring this connectivity. These individuals tend to occupy prominent positions in the scientific and the technological networks. However, our results also show maintaining a very central position in the scientific network may come at the expense of being able to fill a similarly central position in a technological network (and vice versa). Finally, preliminary analysis of the institutional origins of authors-inventors shows that one characteristic, distinctive of Europe compared to the United States, is associated with the relatively lower involvement of corporate scientists at the intersection between the two worlds of science and technology.",205378489; 2599556698,Stefano Breschi; Christian Catalini

A new online site ([PsychFileDrawer.org][1]) lets psychologists post results of replications of experiments—whether they succeed or fail—that would ordinarily never leave their file drawer because most journals decline to publish straightforward replication studies. And a group of more than 50 academic psychologists, which calls itself the Open Science Collaboration, has begun an unprecedented, large-scale project to systematically replicate psychological experiments recently published in leading journals. Some researchers are optimistic that many published findings will be replicated. But others are concerned that if the project confirms few studies, it could unfairly indict psychology. Indeed, the prospect of exposing psychology's foibles has upset some scientists.

The latter are becoming increasingly important (one of the ten ideas changing the world, according to Time magazine) since they allow to collect, store and distribute in a secure and professional way a critical mass of human biological samples for research purposes. Tissues and related data are fundamental for the development of the biomedical research and the emerging field of translational medicine: they represent the “raw material” for every kind of biomedical study. For this reason, it is crucial to understand the boundaries of Intellectual Property (IP) in this prickly context. In fact, both data sharing and collaborative research have become an imperative in contemporary open science, whose development depends inextricably on: the opportunities to access and use data, the possibility of sharing practices between communities, the cross-checking of information and results and, chiefly, interactions with experts in different fields of knowledge. Data sharing allows both to spread the costs of analytical results that researchers cannot achieve working individually and, if properly managed, to avoid the duplication of research. These advantages are crucial: access to a common pool of pre-competitive data and the possibility to endorse follow-on research projects are fundamental for the progress of biomedicine. This is why the ""open movement"" is also spreading in the biobank's field. After an overview of the complex interactions among the different stakeholders involved in the process of information and data production, as well as of the main obstacles to the promotion of data sharing (i.e., the appropriability of biological samples and information, the privacy of participants, the lack of interoperability), we will firstly clarify some blurring in language, in particular concerning concepts often mixed up, such as “open source” and “open access”. The aim is to understand whether and to what extent we can apply these concepts to the biomedical field. Afterwards, adopting a comparative perspective, we will analyze the main features of the open models - in particular, the Open Research Data model - which have been proposed in literature for the promotion of data sharing in the field of research biobanks. After such an analysis, we will suggest some recommendations in order to rebalance the clash between exclusivity - the paradigm characterizing the evolution of intellectual property over the last three centuries - and the actual needs for access to knowledge. We argue that the key factor in this balance may come from the right interaction between IP, social norms and contracts. In particular, we need to combine the incentives and the reward mechanisms characterizing scientific communities with data sharing imperative. ",2111890350; 1998237228,Roberto Caso; Rossana Ducato

The expectation is that most statistically significant findings can be replicated in new data and in new laboratories, but in practice many findings have replicated less often than expected, leading to claims of a replication crisis. We review recent methodological literature on questionable research practices, meta-analysis, and power analysis to explain the apparently high rates of failure to replicate. Psychologists can improve research practices to advance knowledge in ways that improve replicability. We recommend that researchers adopt open science conventions of preregi-stration and full disclosure and that replication efforts be based on multiple studies rather than on a single replication attempt. We call for more sophisticated power analyses, careful consideration of the various influences on effect sizes, and more complete disclosure of nonsignificant as well as statistically significant findings.",106487893; 2578431857,Patrick E.

Our discussion clarifies the conceptual differences between e-science and open science, and reports findings from a preliminary look at practices in U.K. e-science projects. Both parts serve to emphasize that it is unwarranted to presume that the development of e-science necessarily promotes global open science collaboration. Since there is evident need for further empirical research to establish where, when, and to what extent “openness” in scientific and engineering research may be expected to advance hand-in-hand, we outline a framework within which such a program of studies might be undertaken.",2584665884; 2200075610; 2115686201,Paul A.

However the non-publication of trials is often not due to a deliberate decision to cover up results.  Commonly in academia it is due to more understandable reasons such as researchers having busy clinical posts, moving onto other more demanding projects, changing research areas or starting a family.  This is called the “file drawer” problem.

Whereas some put their faith in science, others routinely reject and dismiss scientific evidence. This chapter provides an integration of recent research on how people evaluate science. We organize our chapter along three research topics that are most relevant to this goal: ideology, motivation, and morality. We review the relations of political and religious ideologies to science attitudes, discuss the psychological functions and motivational underpinnings of belief in science, and describe work looking at the role of morality when evaluating science and scientists. In the final part of the chapter, we apply what we know about science evaluations to the current crisis of faith in science and the open science movement. Here, we also take into account the increased accessibility and popularization of science and the (perceived) relations between science and industry.",2060326139; 2109302632; 2017318294; 139872033,Bastiaan T.

Research in SB and Gx depends on the use of collections of tissue and data, commonly known as bioresources. Substantial amounts of time and money are being spent on creating these bioresources and it is likely that significant scientific breakthroughs and development of end-products may be missed or delayed if the tissue and data in these resources are not shared. Accordingly, the ‘openness’ of these bioresources — in other words, the ability for other researchers to access, use, and share these resources (which is typically recorded in a bioresource’s IP and access policy) — is a key issue for the success of bioresource initiatives and the progress of SB and Gx. There are, however, many different approaches to openness, and the development and dissemination of new knowledge are not necessarily advanced by distributing material at low cost or without any restrictions; time-limited rights of control (e.g. IP rights) may provide a useful incentive. It is a significant challenge to develop a fit-for-purpose openness policy that balances the advantages (and disadvantages) of different approaches to openness. The Workshop addressed this challenge by: reviewing openness policies adopted by large bioresources; eliciting ideas about access and intellectual property; debating the applicability of different openness policies; and identifying relevant areas for future research.",2100512133; 2133381808,Johnathon E Liddicoat; Kathleen Liddell

Many of these jobs are compute-intensive runs that benefit from submission to clusters at Purdue, TeraGrid, and Open Science Grid (OSG). Most of the nanoHUB users are not computational experts but end-users who expect complete and uninterrupted service. Within the ecology of grid computing resources, we need to manage the grid submissions of these users transparently with the highest possible degree of user satisfaction. In order to best utilize grid computing resources, we have developed a grid probe protocol to test the job submission system from end to end. Beginning in January 2009, we have collected a total of 1.2 million probe results from job submissions to TeraGrid, OSG, Purdue, and nanoHUB compute clusters. We then utilized these results to intelligently submit jobs to various grid sites using a model for probability of success based in part on probe test history. In this paper we present details of our grid probe model, results from the grid probe runs, and a discussion of data from production runs over the same time period. These results have allowed us to begin assessing our utilization of grid resources while providing our users with satisfactory outcomes.",1993054865; 2167728529; 2431370193; 308895637; 2061456158; 1625055017,Lynn K.

This article introduces scientific newsletters as a ‘model organism’ on which to study the moral economy of science. As an exemplary case, the article explores issues of property and propriety in the Drosophila Information Service and explains how newsletters constitute a closed community at the same time that they demand the unrestricted sharing of organisms, techniques, results and other information within the community.

Enforcement of open-data policies, however, largely relies on manual efforts, which invariably lag behind the increasingly automated generation of biological data. To address this problem, we developed a general approach to automatically identify datasets overdue for public release by applying text mining to identify dataset references in published articles and parse query results from repositories to determine if the datasets remain private. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on 2 popular National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repositories: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA). Our Wide-Open system identified a large number of overdue datasets, which spurred administrators to respond directly by releasing 400 datasets in one week.",1648407520; 2032387740; 2095906382,Maxim Grechkin; Hoifung Poon; Bill Howe

While she endorses the dynamic-object model for science, she endorses the static-object model for philosophy of science. I suggest that by modeling her methodology for philosophy on her methodology for science her philosophy would better serve her feminist goals. Feminist theorists have played major roles in contemporary discourses on power and dominance. Understanding how power and dominance are constructed and eventually deconstructed, is a central concern for feminists. The notion that power has one unified source has been called into question by both feminists (eg., Hartsock, Balbus, Cixous, Spivak) and nonfeminists (eg., Foucault, Delueze). This model of power has been seen as part of a patriarchal or logocentric discourse on power. Many theorists are exploring new ways in which to conceive of power altogether. In this context of controversies, Evelyn Fox Keller has not adequately challenged traditional notions of power and dominance. Although Keller describes a new model for conceiving of power relations within scientific research, I will maintain that she adopts a traditional model of power in her philosophy of science. In Evelyn Fox Keller's recent work, she has tried to reconcile feminism and science. Her goal has been to open science to feminist charges of male bias without risking scientific knowledge altogether. In ""The Gender/Science System,"" she gracefully walks the balance beam on the fundamental dilemma: if we open science to feminist scrutiny, which discloses biases in what we have heretofore held as scientific truth, how can we be sure that there is any truth in science? And, if there is truth in science, how can we distinguish it from bias or parochialism?'",2039868925,Kelly Oliver

First, the motivation behind questionable research practices is examined (the desire to get ahead or, at least, not fall behind). Next, behavior modification strategies are discussed, pointing out that reward works better than punishment. Humans are utility seekers and the implementation of current change initiatives is hindered by high initial buy-in costs and insufficient expected utility. Open science tools interested in improving science should team up, to increase utility while lowering the cost and risk associated with engagement. The best way to realign individual and group motives will probably be to create one, centralized, easy to use, platform, with a profile, a feed of targeted science stories based upon previous system interaction, a sophisticated (public) discussion section, and impact metrics which use the associated data. These measures encourage high quality review and other prosocial activities while inhibiting self-serving behavior. Some advantages of centrally digitizing communications are outlined, including ways the data could be used to improve the peer review process. Most generally, it seems that decisions about change design and implementation should be theory and data driven.",1982619012,Brett Thomas Buttliere

However, it is widely believed that current systems are expensive, conservative and prone to various forms of bias. One form of bias identified in the literature is “social bias” linked to the personal attributes of authors and reviewers. To quantify the importance of this form of bias in modern peer review, we analyze three datasets providing information on the attributes of authors and reviewers and review outcomes: one from Frontiers - an open access publishing house with a novel interactive review process, and two from Spanish and international computer science conferences, which use traditional peer review. We use a random intercept model in which review outcome is the dependent variable, author and reviewer attributes are the independent variables and bias is defined by the interaction between author and reviewer attributes. We find no evidence of bias in terms of gender, or the language or prestige of author and reviewer institutions in any of the three datasets, but some weak evidence of regional bias in all three. Reviewer gender and the language and prestige of reviewer institutions appear to have little effect on review outcomes, but author gender, and the characteristics of author institutions have moderate to large effects. The methodology used cannot determine whether these are due to objective differences in scientific merit or entrenched biases shared by all reviewers.",2477666820; 2778335035; 2119546222; 2105412626; 178457257,Richard Walker; Beatriz Barros; Ricardo Conejo; Konrad Neumann; Martin Telefont

Throughout a project’s lifecycle curators organize newly generated data while cleaning and integrating legacy data when it exists, and deciding what data will be preserved for the long term. Although these actions should be part of a well-oiled data management workflow, there are practical challenges in doing so if the collection is very large and heterogeneous, or is accessed by several researchers contemporaneously. There is a need for data management solutions that can help curators with efficient and on-demand analyses of their collection so that they remain well-informed about its evolving characteristics. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards developing a workflow to leverage open science High Performance Computing (HPC) resources for routinely and efficiently conducting data management tasks on large collections. We demonstrate that HPC resources and techniques can significantly reduce the time for accomplishing critical data management tasks, and enable a dynamic archiving throughout the research process. We use a large archaeological data collection with a long and complex formation history as our test case. We share our experiences in adopting open science HPC resources for large-scale data management, which entails understanding usage of the open source HPC environment and training users. These experiences can be generalized to meet the needs of other data curators working with large collections.",2175741774; 2250897821; 1994852333,Ritu Arora; Maria Esteva; Jessica Trelogan

The World Health Organization has identified diabetes to be globally “epidemic”, and points out the need to increase awareness of this status [1]. The chronic nature of these diseases, their long term impact on both patients and their families, and the fact that a definitive “cure” is still missing justifies the involvement of a large number of researchers and clinicians in these areas. This in turn results in numerous publications as a mean of spreading the gathered experiences and obtained knowledge and ultimately aiming to improve the patients’ well-being. The Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders (JDMD) is launched with the hope of contributing to the efforts made to reach this goal.

JDMD is the continuation of our previous publication, the Iranian Journal of Diabetes and Lipid Disorders, an electronic-only journal that published a total of 63 articles between 2008 and 2011. JDMD is owned by the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute (EMRI), a center of excellence and a World Health Organization (WHO) collaborator in the prevention, diagnosis and management of Diabetes and Osteoporosis. EMRI is affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences which is the first and most outstanding academic medical center at national level. The journal will cover a broad range of subjects related to endocrinology such as clinical and epidemiological studies on metabolic diseases and their complications, as well as novel and emerging therapeutics and related basic sciences studies, to name a few specific subjects. Two particular topics, namely “Aging” and “Interdisciplinary Research” are intended to be the subjects of special issues. Like its predecessor, JDMD is a peer-reviewed journal and, after acceptance, articles will be immediately published online, and soon after indexed in PubMed. All articles submitted to JDMD will be peer reviewed by our Editorial Board (http://www.jdmdonline.com/about/edboard) and, after acceptance, will be immediately published online, and soon after indexed in PubMed.

The aim of the changes made to the journal is to move to a more dynamic scheme of publication, which will be more in line with the current modes of scientific communication and spread of health-related information. With the wide dissemination of new communication technologies, and the trend toward “open science”, methods are debated to make the best from new models of data publishing [2]. As an open access journal, JDMD articles will be freely available to all potential readers, leading to a broader audience and higher visibility of articles [3]. Presently, although JDMD is an open-access journal, all publishing costs are covered by the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

A multidisciplinary approach to endocrinology problems has been a central paradigm in the research activities of EMRI during the past seventeen years; the same spirit is intended to be present in the journal, which will propose a variety of themes. We rely on the distinguished scientists that form the Editorial Board to ensure the quality of published articles in these diverse subjects.

Finally, a journal’s success and impact depends directly on the publication of the hard work of researchers in the field. As such, we would welcome you to submit your research to Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders in order to promote it towards becoming one of the top journals in its field.",1993055715,Bagher Larijani

This paper begins with an introduction that contextualises the discussion. Section II of this paper examines in detail the current crisis in science. Section III introduces how open science emerged as a movement to counter this crisis. It also discusses the diverse benefits and challenges of practising open science. Section IV analyses the implications of open science for the global south. In this section, we also map the evolution of the open movements in India.

In the Open Science Grid (OSG), privileges are granted on the basis of the user's membership to a Virtual Organization (VO). However, Grid sites are solely responsible to determine and control access privileges to resources using users identity and personal attributes, which are available through Grid credentials. While this guarantees full control on access rights to the sites, it makes VO privileges heterogeneous throughout the Grid and hardly fits with the Grid paradigm of uniform access to resources. To address these challenges, we are developing the Scalable Virtual Organization Privileges Management Environment (SVOPME), which provides tools for VOs to define and publish desired privileges and assists sites to provide the appropriate access policies. Moreover, SVOPME provides tools for Grid sites to analyze site access policies for various resources, verify compliance with preferred VO policies, and generate directives for site administrators on how the local access policies can be amended to achieve such compliance without taking control of local configurations away from site administrators. This paper discusses what access policies are of interest to the OSG community and how SVOPME implements privilege management for OSG.",25894833; 2568145609; 2719624678; 2701036788; 2714839988; 2091181715,Gabriele Garzoglio; Balamurali Anathan; Nanbor Wang; Boulder Tech-X; I.

We then discuss the role faculty play in commercialization through the licensing process. Concerns have been voiced in recent years over the possibility that the recent growth in university licensing suggests that the traditional role of faculty in the generation of “basic” research results – as well, possibly, as their role in “open science” – has been compromised. We discuss the available evidence for this downside to faculty licensing. Finally, we consider several impediments to the licensing process.",1966567966; 2311598555,Jerry G. Thursby; Marie C. Thursby

Although it is well known that research cooperation activities are an important channel of knowledge transfer, the knowledge about factors driving research cooperation is limited. This paper explicitly focuses on scientist perspective and investigates the relevance of academic values and perceived costs and benefits of cooperation for a scientist's decision to cooperate with private firms. Our analysis is based on two survey waves performed with scientists in the Max Planck Society in Germany which is a publicly funded research organization focusing on basic research. Our empirical results suggest that open science identity is an important determinant of scientist fundamental decision to cooperate with private firms at all. The decision to keep on cooperating with private firms is directly influenced by cost sharing incentives and by firms' confidentiality requirements. Besides these direct effects, our results suggest that perceived reputational reward, monetary benefits, and time costs associated with cooperation influence cooperation behavior indirectly through their impact on the attractiveness of cooperation. The latter is a strong and robust predictor of cooperation behavior.",1972021510; 2309078059; 142741,David B. Audretsch; Werner Bönte; Stefan Krabel

Ensuring that students fully appreciate the four-dimensional nature of embryonic development and morphogenesis is a particular issue, and one that I argue can only be properly learned via direct exposure to embryos via laboratory practicals.",2048163161,John F.

Scholars have thus more critically examined ways in which these two institutional regimes intersect. Large open source software projects have also attracted commercial collaborators and now struggle to develop code in an open public environment that still protects their communal boundaries. This research applies a dynamic social network approach to understand how one community-managed software project, Debian, developed a membership process. We examine the project's face-to-face social network over a five-year period (1997-2001) to see how changes in the social structure affected the evolution of membership mechanisms and the determination of gatekeepers. While the amount and importance of a contributor's work increased the probability that a contributor would become a gatekeeper, those more central in the social network were more likely to become gatekeepers and influence the membership process. A greater understanding of the mechanisms open projects use to manage their boundaries has critical implications for research and knowledge-producing communities operating in pluralistic, open and distributed environments.",2106408547; 2185555086,Siobhan Clare O'Mahony; Fabrizio Ferraro

The collaboration rules that typically govern large science experiments as well as social networks of scientists span across the institutional security boundaries. A common concern is that the increased openness may allow malicious attackers to spread more readily around the grid. We consider how to optimally respond to attacks in open grid environments. To show how and why attacks spread more readily around the grid, we first discuss how collaborations manifest themselves in the grids and form the collaboration network graph, and how this collaboration network graph affects the security threat levels of grid participants. We present two mixed-integer program (MIP) models to find the optimal response to attacks in open grid environments, and also calculate the threat level associated with each grid participant. Given an attack scenario, our optimal response model aims to minimize the threat levels at unaffected participants while maximizing the uninterrupted scientific production (continuing collaborations). By adopting some of the collaboration rules (e.g., suspending a collaboration or shutting down a site), the model finds optimal response to subvert an attack scenario.",1870418297; 228621391; 559142080; 2617045311,Mine Altunay; Sven Leyffer; Jeff Linderoth; Zhen Xie

Evidence shows that IP protection has become a norm for universities and GRIs throughout the world. The increased patenting and commercialization activity, however, brings with it concerns over limitation of the right for follow-up research, changes the norms of open-science and constrains open innovation in industry. The ensuing question is: will the increase in patenting activities by GRIs affect the patterns of knowledge transfer from the institute to the upstream, middle-stream and downstream industries? How do the GRIs decide which agricultural innovations are to be made available in the public domain and which are to be patented and made accessible for a fee? This paper first examines the central concerns surrounding open science in GRIs in relation to the output of R &D funded by the Malaysian government. The paper then explores the patent practice of the Malaysian Research Board (MRB) as a case study. MRB is chosen specifically as it is one of the oldest GRIs and the pioneer in patenting in Malaysia. Among the issues that are dealt with in this paper are: how does the Board balance its role in conducting research for the good of the society as opposed to claiming proprietary rights? How does the Board diffuse the R & D results to the small-scale farmers? What are the modes of commercialization adopted by them? The paper ends by suggesting that a balance between open science and patents must be maintained by the MRB in order to move the economy up the value chain.",1575656952; 2133726883,Ida Madieha Abdul Ghani Azmi; Rokiah Alavi

Article publication delay, which occurs in part due to constraints associated with peer review, can prevent the timely dissemination of critical and actionable data associated with new information on rare diseases or developing health concerns such as Zika virus. Preprint servers are open access online repositories housing preprint research articles that enable authors (1) to make their research immediately and freely available and (2) to receive commentary and peer review prior to journal submission. There is a growing movement of preprint advocates aiming to change the current journal publication and peer review system, proposing that preprints catalyze biomedical discovery, support career advancement, and improve scientific communication. While the number of articles submitted to and hosted by preprint servers are gradually increasing, there has been no simple way to identify biomedical research published in a preprint format, as they are not typically indexed and are only discoverable by directly searching the specific preprint server websites. To address this issue, we created a search engine that quickly compiles preprints from disparate host repositories and provides a one-stop search solution. Additionally, we developed a web application that bolsters the discovery of preprints by enabling each and every word or phrase appearing on any web site to be integrated with articles from preprint servers.

Novel diagnostics and analysis methods are being utilized in order to explore the skill of particular processes, the degree to which models have improved since CMIP3, and particular features of the hindcasts, decadal and centennial projections. These assessments strongly benefit from the increasing availability of state-of-the-art data sets and model output processing techniques. Also paleo-climate analysis proves to be useful for demonstrating the ability of models to simulate climate conditions that are different from present day. The existence of an increasingly wide ensemble of model simulations re-emphasizes the need to carefully consider the implications of model spread. Disparity between projected results does imply that model uncertainty exists, but not necessarily reflects a true estimate of this uncertainty. Projections generated by models with a similar origin or utilizing parameter perturbation techniques generally show more mutual agreement than models with different development histories. Weighting results from different models is a potentially useful technique to improve projections, if the purpose of the weighting is clearly identified. However, there is yet no consensus in the community on how to best achieve this.
 
These findings, discussed at the session “Assessing the reliability of climate models: CMIP5” of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) Open Science Conference (OSC), illustrate the need for comprehensive and coordinated model evaluation and data collection.

Data were based on pupils' responses on an attitude survey questionnaire, interviews, video tapes of pupils performing the investigations and field notes. The majority of the pupils liked conducting such investigations. Reasons for positive responses were that the pupils had the freedom to explore and devise their own procedures to find out things that they wanted to know about, they could work together and discuss with friends, the investigations were interesting and it was a valuable learning experience. Reasons for negative responses included the difficulty of coming up with good ideas to design the investigations, and group conflicts.

Now that we are in the so-called 'century of biology', we must ensure that the newly transformed and increasingly relied on biosciences not only respond to the needs of the elderly but also reflect the reality of the elderly. While many arguments can be made in support of increased data-sharing in biomedical research (and indeed within and across healthcare systems more generally), there are some persuasive age-based arguments that might serve to encourage science regulators, through both funding structures and the law, to fundamentally reshape the research environment so as to enhance its potential to achieve public goods such as improved health and more effective healthcare systems. In this paper, after noting the new research model arising from population genomics, with its intense data needs, we advance three age-based arguments, in favour of increased and improved data-sharing, and we conclude with some brief observations about how increased data- sharing might be achieved.",2004880120; 2244148951,Shawn Harmon; Kuan-Hsun Chen

The third annual Virtual Symposium on Information & Technology in the Arts & Humanities, held on April 18 and 19, 2017, centered on a theme of open science in the humanities. Presentations at the Symposium have included topics such as data visualization, historical images, interactive exhibits and linked data. The 2017 theme of open humanities was a starting point for the speakers to consider how open science has and can impact the world of humanities in various ways. Speakers at the symposium discussed analyzing writing practices on the internet using web scrapers, data management in the humanities, visual literacy skills of graduate and undergraduate students and the challenge researchers face in trying to keep up with publications in their field.",2109014312,Jeremy L.

Built upon findings from an e-survey and a high-level workshop involving a wide range of stakeholders, this paper makes an early contribution to understanding the significant factors enabling or hindering the uptake of open science practice in the immediate research areas involving research professionals and research organisations. We found that key drivers to the uptake of open science practices include the usefulness of publicly available research outcomes in developing personal lines of research; nonetheless, the propensity of research professionals to openly share their contributions is not high. Operational barriers such as difficulties in assessing the quality and rigour of research contributions, lack of skills and or time to contribute to the open science movement are slowing the uptake of open science. More importantly, there are institutional barriers linked to systemic issues such as the inadequacy of the current funding schemes. In particular, we found that institutional inertia plays a significant role in inhibiting the further opening of the scientific process.

Universities developed novel breeding techniques, and small grow out mom-and-pop farms implemented them. Eyed eggs were generic and standardized products, and traded at the lowest possible cost. As an eyed egg, the fry and in particular the eyes are visible through the membrane. The interplay between the regimes of open science and proprietary science has changed significantly in salmon aquaculture over the last two decades. One aspect of this change is that husbandry breeding has become more industrialized and subsequently more controlled by large, specialized and capital intensive breeding corporations. This paper explores this development from the perspectives of process-oriented institutional theory. We identify critical junctures in the coevolution of the breeding and grow-out sectors, and analyze how these junctures structure and change the direction of industrial and economic development. Ultimately, the generic, standardized and undervalued eyed eggs were subject to revaluation by the novel dominant international actors in the Atlantic salmon industry.

The hypothesis that open science therefore has the potential to support public engagement with science has been investigated through the research outlined in this thesis. The research has also sought to address the related issues of how, or if, the science thus made available therefore needs to be translated and narrated for public consumption and how, or if, open science can or should develop as a deep and bidirectional mode of engagement between members of the public and researchers.
The research employed two methods of qualitative enquiry (interviews and case studies) and one method of quantitative enquiry (a web-based questionnaire survey) to enable appropriate validation through methodological triangulation. The interview participants, recruited through purposive sampling, took part in semi-structured interviews, which were analysed using a grounded theory approach. Three exploratory case studies were selected using a descriptive decision matrix. The case studies were conducted using a mixture of ethnographic observations of events, meetings and other situations involving personal contact, documentary studies of project websites, available materials and so on, and interviews with project members. Finally, a web-based survey was carried out to establish baseline data on the scientific and cultural background, motivations and opinions of visitors to open science project websites.
The results suggest that although the principle of openness is widely accepted, there are a number of issues to be addressed as research is opened up to a wider public. These include the development of shared praxis between researchers and members of the public, for example understanding of data analysis techniques and how to support judgements of validity and trustworthiness of information. Problems of data ownership are also foreseen, both in terms of proprietary and intellectual property rights, the maintenance of reputation, precedence and priority and in how to value non-professional and non-traditional contributions to research.
The results also indicate that open science has the credentials to claim a place in the ranks of public engagement strategies. This research indicates that open science is not yet a tightly-defined practice; as a flexible, innovative methodology, it offers a variety of routes for engagement for both scientists and members of the public. For scientists, it could be a mode for communication in which the communicative activities are part of daily scientific work. For members of the public, it could enable them to follow a project in which they are interested, offering direct access to data, publications and other research outputs. For both communities, it could support the development and sustaining of public participation in research, and enable dialogue and collaboration throughout the scientific process, from defining the research question, to research design, to experiment, to analysis.",2114433508,Ann Grand

The research identifies that this innovation is not an incremental improvement, but a new “literary technology” that fosters a new way of producing and communicating science. It dialogues with the liquid publications notion and it is a strategic element of a complex, open collaborative ecosystem that aims to move from a “science based on trust” to a science based on transparency and data provenance. Embedded within new material and social technologies, it fosters a epistemic culture that we name matter of proof because it values, above all, the ability of scientists to adequately document the experiments that subsidize their claims.",2037939590; 1985335732,Anne Clinio; Sarita Albagli

First part of the speech concerns a global transformation of the process of scientific communication, occurring due to the digital revolution. As a result, we observe growing openness of all forms of scientific content: publications, educational materials, data or scientific software. This leads to a redefinition of the rules of conducting science towards greater openness and transparency, and a concurrent transformation of institutions and mechanisms responsible for scientific communication. On one hand, new tools are created – technical, such as software for creating databases and repositories, and legal solutions, such as open licenses that allow free availability of content. Secondly, international organizations, grant-giving institutions, universities and research institutes ever more often adopt institutional mandates that recommend or require openness of scientific content. In particular, open mandates of this sort require results of research conducted with the help of public funds to be publicly available. Second part concerns the development of the open science models in Poland. This model allows digital exclusion to be eliminated, increases visibility and reuse of research results, and changes mechanisms for evaluation of publications and research results. Until today, open models of scientific communication remain relatively little known and not sufficiently developed or supported, in particular by state regulation. Nevertheless they are being developed today by a range of different institutions. One of them is the Interdisciplinary Center for Mathematical and Computational Modeling at the University of Warsaw, which has been developing in the last dozen years the Virtual Library of Science project. The goal of this project is the creation in Poland of an infrastructure for open science, in the shape of a unified system of content with a hybrid structure. Bibliographical and full-text databases based on the Yadda platform: BazTech, BazHum and Agro, are an important part of this infrastructure. The third part of the speech will present the current state of development of the Virtual Library of Science, as well as possible future actions, tied to the development and promotion of open science in Poland.",2343667451,Marek Niezgódka

We first formulate a number of necessary conditions that should be met by any design dedicated to perform open scientific evaluation. To introduce our framework, we provide a basic data standard and communication protocol. We argue for the superiority of a provider-independent framework, over a few isolated implementations, which allows the collection and analysis of open evaluation content across a wide range of diverse providers like scientific journals, research institutions, social networks, publishers websites, and more. Furthermore, we describe how its technical implementation can be achieved by using existing web standards and technology.

The field of neuroscience, however, has yet to adopt the preprint model. A reason for this reluctance might partly be the lack of central preprint services for the field of neuroscience. To address this issue, we announce the launch of Preprints of the R-fMRI Network (PRN), a community funded preprint hosting service. PRN provides free-submission and free hosting of manuscripts for resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and neuroscience related studies. Submitted articles are openly discussed and receive feedback from readers and a panel of invited consultants from the R-fMRI Network. All manuscripts and feedback are freely accessible online with citable permanent URL for open-access. The goal of PRN is to supplement the peer reviewed journal publication system – by more rapidly communicating the latest research achievements throughout the world. We hope PRN would help the field to embrace the preprint model and thus further accelerate R-fMRI and neuroscience related studies, eventually enhancing human mental health.",2169327217; 2106870013; 2659867049,Chao-Gan Yan; Qingyang Li; Lei Gao

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided bioinformatics developers with a forum for communicating the results of their latest efforts to the wider research community, and a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about standards, software development practices and practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems. BOSC includes a 2 day ‘CodeFest’ preceding the formal conference, which provides a venue for developers to meet in person to work on or plan joint projects (Moller et al., 2013).

The session topics at BOSC 2013 included Cloud and Parallel Computing, Visualization, Software Interoperability, Genome-scale Data Management, a session for updates on ongoing Open Source projects and two new sessions: Open Science and Reproducible Research and Translational Bioinformatics, recognizing the growing use of computational biology in medical applications. Slides from all of the presentations are available on the BOSC Web site, along with some of the posters and video recordings for selected talks, including the keynotes and panel discussion.

Open Science is a movement dedicated to making all aspects of scientific knowledge production freely available for reuse and extension, including scientific data, methods and analyses. In response to the increasing traction that this movement has gained, BOSC 2013 featured a new session devoted explicitly to Open Science. One of the objectives of Open Science is the wider issue of making published research reproducible. Aside from openness in software licensing, this also includes openness of data and unhindered access to scientific papers themselves (Open Access). When researchers can freely access publications and the source code and data that support them, it becomes possible for them to recreate the steps that the authors went through to reach their conclusions and to then go beyond them. In this way, Open Science not only stands to provide the value of validating published results by recreating them but also to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, by enabling researchers to more effectively build on the results of previous work, rather than having to reinvent tools and reassemble datasets.

Each day of BOSC traditionally starts off with a keynote talk by a person of influence in Open Source bioinformatics. BOSC 2013’s first keynote speaker was Cameron Neylon, the Advocacy Director for the Public Library of Science, who is a prominent advocate for open science. Neylon discussed the cultural issues that are hindering open science, and spoke about the potential of openness in scientific collaborations for generating impact. Our second keynote speaker was Sean Eddy, a group leader at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm, who is perhaps best known as the author of the HMMER software suite (Eddy, 2011). He discussed how his own experience and practices show that dedicating effort to thorough engineering in tool development—which is often shunned as uninteresting and unpublishable—can be a key to creating a lasting impact.

To stimulate discussion on controversial or multifaceted topics, BOSC includes a panel, in which panelists representing a range of viewpoints, answer questions from the audience. This year’s panel was on Strategies for Funding and Maintaining Open Source Software. To secure continued funding for a software project, researchers must be able to demonstrate its impact. The panelists explored ways to quantify usage of one’s software as a measure of impact. They agreed that traditional publications, and tracking their citations, still play an important role in publicizing and demonstrating the use of one’s software, but they are not the only metric.

With the increasing reliance of more and more fields of biology on computational tools to manage and analyze their data, BOSC seems assured to stay relevant to life science, and thus to life scientists.

Data sharing has been encouraged to facilitate open science within the clinical research enterprise, improve the development of drugs and devices, and benefit public health. To date, the subject has received considerable attention in the media and scientific literature, however focused mainly on philosophical arguments. Of the empirical research that exists, much of it has focused on data sharing among academic investigators in the field of life science, including biomedical research, medicine, and genetics. A number of commentaries and editorials have dealt with the ethical repercussions when researchers choose not to share data; others have discussed real or perceived legal barriers to data sharing. These barriers include (1) compromised intellectual property rights and unfair advantages to competitors, (2) risk of increased product liability, (3) issues of collusion under antitrust laws, and (4) risks to research participant privacy. This report examines the legal issues that may pose barriers to data sharing. The report provides a helpful guide to those in the biomedical community who wish to engage in data sharing. In each section, the authors provide an overview of the legal issue, including the statutes and other background, and suggest approaches for surmounting legal issues. ",2016055603; 1974172714; 1927636742; 2644772221,Aliza Y.

In particular, our motivation was to aid the development of cyberinfrastructure for Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs) for marine ecosystems. The IEA process involves analysis of natural and socio-economic information based on diverse and disparate sources of data, requiring collaboration among scientists of many disciplines and communication with other stakeholders. Here we describe our bottom-up approach to developing cyberinfrastructure through a collaborative process engaging a small group of domain and computer scientists and software engineers. We report on a use case evaluated for an Ecosystem Status Report, a multi-disciplinary report inclusive of Earth, life, and social sciences, for the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Ultimately, we focused on sharing workflows as a component of the cyberinfrastructure to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. We developed and deployed a software environment to generate a portion of the Report, retaining traceability of derived datasets including indicators of climate forcing, physical pressures, and ecosystem states. Our solution for sharing workflows and delivering reproducible documents includes IPython (now Jupyter) Notebooks. We describe technical and social challenges that we encountered in the use case and the importance of training to aid the adoption of best practices and new technologies by domain scientists. We consider the larger challenges for developing end-to-end cyberinfrastructure that engages other participants and stakeholders in the IEA process.",2148141300; 2102575901; 2753975348; 2066681386; 2144523891; 2129389793; 2302420930,Stace E.

Being capable of analysing and interpreting raw data is increasingly important and can be seen as key to the development of transversal skills, which are defined by UNESCO as “critical and innovative thinking, inter-personal skills; intra-personal skills, and global citizenship”.

If one of our goals as educators is to develop these transversal skills in students, towards enabling them to function as citizens, to actively participate in the discourse and debates of society, then we propose that Open Data can play a key role. Open Data is produced and used at various levels in research, governance, policy making and civil society. In educational and academic contexts, Open Data can be understood and used as an Open Educational Resource (OER) to help support the engagement of students and researchers in analysing and collaborating towards finding solutions for contemporary real-world problems, chiefly by embedding Open Data and Open Science principles in research-based, scenario-led activities. In this way, students can experience working with the same raw materials scientists and policy-makers use.

We will report on a series of case studies of the use of Open Data as OER with a particular focus on good practices identified by these educators. We can suggest educators embracing Open Data in the classroom must consider the following elements:
•	Focus: define the research problem and its relation to the environment students.
•	Practicality: match technical applications and practices to expected solutions.
•	Expectations: set realistic expectations for data analysis.
•	Directions: support in finding data portals which contain appropriate information.
•	Training: provide training materials for the software students will need to analyse the data.
•	Location: use global, local and scientific data which is as granular as possible.
•	Modelling: develop model solutions to guide students on the challenges and activities.
•	Collaboration: support students to work collaboratively and at multidisciplinary level.
•	Communication: support students in communicating their findings to local or wider communities.

While there is already a degree of consensus in the academic and political levels on the value of Open Data for researchers, it is necessary to establish educational models and good practice in the use of Open Data as OER, and therefore enable students to become critical and engaged citizens.",1912349084; 2029699963,Javiera Atenas; Leo Havemann

Inquiry and problem solving are promoted in contemporary science and mathematics education reforms as a critical attribute of the nature of disciplines, teaching methods, and learning outcomes involving understandings, attitudes, and processes. The investigative and quantitative processes involved in scientific inquiry include seeking problems, identifying researchable questions, proposing hypotheses, designing fair tests, collecting and interpreting data as evidence for claims, constructing evidence-based arguments, and communicating knowledge claims. Within this empirical context, science and mathematics come together to solve problems with evidence, construct knowledge claims, communicate claims, and persuade others that the claims are valid and useful. This study examined the intersection of inquiry and problem solving and the use of mathematics in 26 extracurricular open science inquiries. The category and the appropriateness of the mathematical procedures revealed these students used measurement, numeracy skills of counting and calculation, and tables and graphs in their science inquiries. It was found that most measurements in the science inquiries were used appropriately, but there is room for improvement with other mathematical procedures that involve higher-level thinking skills, such as analyzing and calculating numerical data and interpreting graphs and tables. The findings imply that mathematics and science are connected in inquiry and should be extended to solve real-life problems and that instruction should emphasize comprehending and interpreting data.",2113785202,Winnie Wing-mui So

The facilities offer communal living, supported independence and choice to participate in activities. Existing studies have shown that gardens can offer older people physiological, psychological and social benefits (Alves and Sugiyama 2006). Yet there is limited research into how the design of gardens in sheltered housing developments is considered. Methods Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Brighton's School Research Ethics and Governance Panel. A qualitative approach was used to help investigate and understand the planning process using an interpretivist epistemology and a constructivist ontology. Results Three semi-structured interviews were then conducted with the managers of sheltered housing developments. The five key themes of the findings were: considerations when planning a garden how residents use the gardens well-being identity and social interaction the managers' involvement Seven sub-themes were also found: variety of plants the elements accessibility space gardeners and contractors security finances Conclusions The findings discuss the individual needs and choices of residents, as well as exploring the role managers can play in providing opportunities for residents to utilise their gardens However, they also reveal potential barriers to planning a garden. Participation in the research enabled the housing managers to reflect on how they enhance the gardens for their residents. The findings inform occupational therapists involved in planning o safe, therapeutic outside environments.

After controlling for founders' prior work experience and other organizational and environmental factors, I find that firms with proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs on the founding team have a higher probability of adopting open science. In addition, founders' educational background can mitigate the constraint of organizational environments on strategy. A crowded technological niche provides a more challenging environment for firms to implement open science, due to higher scooping risks. The deterrent effect, however, of such a high-risk environment is smaller among firms founded by proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs. There is also some evidence of a stronger effect of founders' educational background on open science in an institutional environment in which open science has yet to become the industry norm. This finding is consistent with and complements the growing body of research that emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurial background in developing knowledge about new-venture strategy and structure.

There is growing concern that current technical and ethical safeguards to protect the identities of donors could be insufficient. In the context of human embryonic stem cell research, there are no studies focusing on the probability that an hESC line donor could be identified by analyzing published SNP profiles and associated genotypic and phenotypic information. We present the International Stem Cell Forum (ISCF) Ethics Working Party’s Policy Statement on “Publishing SNP Genotypes of Human Embryonic Stem Cell Lines (hESC)”. The Statement prospectively addresses issues surrounding the publication of genotypic data and associated annotations of hESC lines in open access databases. It proposes a balanced approach between the goals of open science and data sharing with the respect for fundamental bioethical principles (autonomy, privacy, beneficence, justice and research merit and integrity).",2068298254; 2375481012; 2437938534; 2688617307; 2011659102; 2174862489; 2649939361; 2089053084; 116448358; 2297987337; 2159249280; 2129173883; 2776901916; 2514389923; 2654013567,Bartha Maria Knoppers; Genevra Richardson; Douglas Sipp; Klaus Tanner; Jan Wahlström; Guido de Wert; Fanyi Zeng; Rosario Isasi; Nissim Benvenisty; Ock-Joo Kim; Geoffrey Lomax; Clive Morris; Thomas H.

However, the effective and efficient use of biobank resources depends on their accessibility. In fact, making bio-resources promptly accessible to everybody may increase the benefits for society. Furthermore, optimizing their use and ensuring their quality will promote scientific creativity and, in general, contribute to the progress of bio-medical research. Although this has become a rather common belief, several laboratories are still secretive and continue to withhold samples and data. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey in order to investigate sample and data accessibility in research biobanks operating all over the world. The survey involved a total of 46 biobanks. Most of them gave permission to access their samples (95.7%) and data (85.4%), but free and unconditioned accessibility seemed not to be common practice. The analysis of the guidelines regarding the accessibility to resources of the biobanks that responded to the survey highlights three issues: (i) the request for applicants to explain what they would like to do with the resources requested; (ii) the role of funding, public or private, in the establishment of fruitful collaborations between biobanks and research labs; (iii) the request of co-authorship in order to give access to their data. These results suggest that economic and academic aspects are involved in determining the extent of sample and data sharing stored in biobanks. As a second step of this study, we investigated the reasons behind the high diversity of requirements to access biobank resources. The analysis of informative answers suggested that the different modalities of resource accessibility seem to be largely influenced by both social context and legislation of the countries where the biobanks operate.",2066956233; 1973107688; 1507262415; 2153605174; 700325191; 1978554192; 1767582760,Marco Capocasa; Paolo Anagnostou; Flavio D'Abramo; Giulia Matteucci; Valentina Dominici; Giovanni Destro Bisol; Fabrizio Rufo

In particular, the ideal of hacking as developed through studies of free and open source (F/OS) has highlighted the value of processes of participation, including participatory governance, in relation to the value of expanded accessibility of knowledge, including knowledge commons. Yet, these means and ends are often conflated. This article employs three examples of projects where hacker-inspired perspectives on scientific knowledge conflict with institutional perspectives. Each example develops differently the relationships between means and ends in relation to authority and legitimacy.

A number of websites make available spectral data for download (typically as JCAMP-DX text files) and one (ChemSpider) that also allows users to contribute spectral files. As a result, searching and retrieving such spectral data can be time consuming, and difficult to reuse if the data is compressed in the JCAMP-DX file. What is needed is a single resource that allows submission of JCAMP-DX files, export of the raw data in multiple formats, searching based on multiple chemical identifiers, and is open in terms of license and access. To address these issues a new online resource called the Open Spectral Database (OSDB) http://osdb.info/ has been developed and is now available. Built using open source tools, using open code (hosted on GitHub), providing open data, and open to community input about design and functionality, the OSDB is available for anyone to submit spectral data, making it searchable and available to the scientific community. This paper details the concept and coding, internal architecture, export formats, Representational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface and options for submission of data.",2462224357,Stuart J.

It promises in particular to be a source of cheaper and simpler solutions for environmental monitoring, personal diagnostic and the use of biomaterials. The successful growth of a global community of DIYbio practitioners will depend largely on enabling safe access to state-of-the-art molecular biology tools and resources. In this paper we analyze the rise of DIYbio, its community, its material resources and its applications. We look at the current projects developed for the international genetically engineered machine competition in order to get a sense of what amateur biologists can potentially create in their community laboratories over the coming years. We also show why and how the DIYbio community, in the context of a global governance development, is putting in place a safety/ethical framework for guarantying the pursuit of its activity. And finally we argue that the global spread of DIY biology potentially reconfigures and opens up access to biological information and laboratory equipment and that, therefore, it can foster new practices and transversal collaborations between professional scientists and amateurs.",1410698772; 2139694004; 2562486372; 2654099323,Thomas E.

The text has come down to us in  an unusually large number of manuscripts, most of which transmit a mainstream version of the text. Methods: In the present article, three versions deriving from the mainstream text are being examined. For this, these versions are being compared to the mainstream text, in order to understand the aim behind the alterations and additions they were subjected to. The overarching goal is to understand, why these changes were made, and how skilled the editors were. It is a rather unusual approach, as divergent versions are usually not examined in research literature, since they are secondary to the original text. Results and conclusions: The results clearly show that the text was redacted several times, but not by highly sophisticated editors. The general aims of the redactions were to make the text easier to understand.",2223722009,Barbara Zipser

However, with the deployment of multiple disconnected Grid environments, we are now faced with the problem of interoperable access to resources from multiple environments to meet the requirements of scientific applications. Within the U. S. cyberinfrastructure environments, two key elements: both the National Science Foundation TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid (OSG) provide varied but important capabilities and resources needed by diverse computational communities. Hence, it is critical to understand how these communities can benefit from bridging these different environments and utilize them when needed. In this paper we present a novel approach to interoperable access to both OSG and TeraGrid to users through the CyberGIS Gateway -- an online geographic information system. In particular, five key interoperability themes are addressed: authentication and authorization, information services, data management, and computation management and auditing. We take a scientific application use-case (viewshed analysis) on the CyberGIS Gateway to demonstrate how to exploit resources on both OSG and TeraGrid.",2208809082; 2286208985; 2592412438,Anand Padmanabhan; Shaowen Wang; John Paul Navarro

But e-science network development is already encountering difficulty over the intellectual property rights associated with data and networked collaborative activity. Intellectual property regimes are often problematic in the practice of science, as scientific research typically assumes practices of openness that may be hampered or obstructed by intellectual property rights. A considerable literature has developed documenting and analyzing the impact of patents on research in the biomedical area, and the history of recent major scientific initiatives, such as the Human Genome Project, have been punctuated by clashes over the propriety and provision of patent rights in the accumulated data. These difficulties are likely to be exacerbated in the context of e-science collaboration, where the development and use of intellectual resources will likely be distributed among many researchers in a variety of physical locations, often spanning national boundaries. The institutions that sponsor e-science collaborators may have differing intellectual property policies. Additionally, intellectual property is largely territorial, and the rights conferred under patent or copyright laws are relegated to a single nation. Although international treaties have to some extent harmonized the basic features of intellectual property across many jurisdictions, the subject matter, scope, and requirements for patents and copyrights vary from country to country. A potential solution to this problem has been developed in the context of ""open source"" coding projects, where work on software projects is distributed and collaborative, occurring via the Internet or other computer-mediated communications networks. Such projects have employed ""copyleft"" licenses that attach automatically when the work product of the project is modified. Such licenses are particularly intended to hold the work product ""open"" to the community by preventing modifications or uses that would allow proprietary claims to the work product of the community.The value of ""openness"" and access in the open source community parallels the expressed concerns of scientific researchers over openness and access to collaborative data and discoveries. Consequently, the open source ""copyleft"" model might seem an attractive mechanism for preserving similar values in e-science. However, such ""copyleft"" instruments are highly specific to the norms and behavioral expectations of the community in which they were developed. The organizational structure of scientific research may not map cleanly onto the ""copyleft"" model, and the patent rights implicated by e-science differ from the copyright issues contemplated under ""copyleft"" licenses. Consequently, a firm understanding of not only the technical structure, but of the social and communicative structure of e-science will be necessary in order to adapt licensing solutions to the practice of e-science.",2169840793,Dan L.

A more formalized citizen-science enterprise, complete with networked organizations, associations, journals, and cyberinfrastructure, will advance scientific research, including ecology, and further public education.",2128066226; 2146414479; 2345521748; 2101880619; 2549476584; 1971183707,Greg Newman; Andrea Wiggins; Alycia W.

In turn, genomics is underpinned by a reference sequence and ancillary information created by so-called “genome projects”. The most reliable genome projects are the ones created as part of an active research program and designed to address specific questions but their life extends past publication. In this opinion paper I outline four key insights that have facilitated maintaining genomic communities: the key role of computational capability, the iterative process of building genomic resources, the value of community participation and the importance of manual curation. Taken together, these ideas can and do ensure the longevity of genome projects and the growing non-model species community can use them to focus a discussion with regards to its future genomic infrastructure.",2122056275,Alexie Papanicolaou

Our research points out that open notebook science is not an incremental improvement, but it is a new “literary technology” (Shapin, Shaffer, 1985) and main element of a complex open collaboration ecosystem that fosters a new epistemic culture (Knorr-Cetina, 1999). This innovation aimed to move from a “science based on trust” to a science based on transparency and data provenance - a shift that recognizes the ability of scientists in performing experiments, but mostly, values their capacity of documenting properly what they say they have done. The theoretical framework was built with the notion of epistemic culture (Knorr-Cetina, 1999) and the “three technologies” perspective used by Shapin and Shaffer (1985) to describe the construction by natural philosophers of “matter of fact” as “variety of knowledge” so powerful that became synonymous of science itself. Empirically, we entered the “open lab” through a netnography that led us to understand that the epistemic culture being engendered by its practitioners is based on a “matter of proof”.",2037939590; 1985335732,Anne Clinio; Sarita Albagli

This is an incredibly useful community resource that complements existing efforts like the Genome in a Bottle project by providing a set of validated, difficult regions to evaluate variant detection tools. I appreciate the efforts to make these test sets public; instead of having validation sets like these developed internally at clinical laboratories, we can collaborate and improve them publicly.


In collaboration with Oliver Hofmann at the Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Center ( https://twitter.com/fiamh) we obtained access to the data and were able to run a validation using bcbio variant calling ( http://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io). In doing this, we tried to address a couple of challenges for other users wanting to make immediate use of this data in their own in hour validation work: 


The truth sets are not easy to plug into existing validation frameworks. Most validation tools like rtg vcfeval and hap.py work from VCF format files, while this truth set is in a custom spreadsheet format with a mixture of methods for describing changes. You can use Platypus positions for many but need to use CSN descriptions or evaluated position for the remainder.


The truth sets don't appear to describe if we expect calls to be homozygous or heterozygous calls at each position.


Many existing validation approaches expect a single (or few) samples so coordinating checking and validation for all these samples can be a challenge.


As part of this review, we generated a set of configuration files and scripts to help make running validations with ICR142 easier ( https://github.com/bcbio/icr142-validation).



This comparison work also includes a set of comparisons with common callers (GATK HaplotypeCaller, FreeBayes and VarDict). Several of the Sanger validated regions without variants are false positives in at least 2 of the callers tested, so this dataset exposes some common issues with calling and filtering. It would be useful to hear the author's experience with validating callers using this benchmark set and if they have additional filters used to avoid these problems. Knowing a baseline expectation for results would help ensure that the users understand how correctly they've setup the validation resources.

The movement toward a clinical research culture that supports data sharing has important implications for the design, conduct, and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. While data sharing is likely to enhance the science of evidence synthesis, facilitating the identification and inclusion of all relevant research, it will also pose key challenges, such as requiring broader search strategies and more thorough scrutiny of identified research. Furthermore, the adoption of data sharing initiatives by the clinical research community should challenge the community of researchers involved in evidence synthesis to follow suit, including the widespread adoption of systematic review registration, results reporting, and data sharing, to promote transparency and enhance the integrity of the research process.",2142156483,Joseph S.

We investigated the use of these practices in empirical articles published by Psychological Science and, for comparison, by the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, during the period of January 2013 to December 2015. The use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) was extremely high at all times and in both journals. In Psychological Science, the use of confidence intervals increased markedly overall, from 28% of articles in 2013 to 70% in 2015, as did the availability of open data (3 to 39%) and open materials (7 to 31%). The other journal showed smaller or much smaller changes. Our findings suggest that journal-specific submission guidelines may encourage desirable changes in authors’ practices.",1163426945; 2103613314; 2529228439; 2746901221; 2344830518,David Giofrè; Geoff Cumming; Luca Fresc; Ingrid Boedker; Patrizio E.

Results indicate that high levels of academic entrepreneurship in a scientific field are associated with less reliance on the gift-giving form of sharing (i.e., generalized exchange) traditionally recommended by scientific communities, and with a greater emphasis on direct benefits for givers (i.e., direct exchange), as well as a lower overall frequency of sharing. We observe these shifts in sharing behavior even among individual scientists who are not themselves entrepreneurially active; this suggests a general shift in scientific norms contingent on institutional contexts. These findings reflect contradictions inherent in current science policies that simultaneously encourage open science as well as commercial application of research results, and they suggest that the increasing emphasis on commercial activity may fundamentally change the normative structure of science.

A multi-disciplinary, cross-organisational approach was taken in developing a platform of collaboration to support the understanding of climate change impact and the formulation of adaptation strategies.The platform comprises a number of components including: (i) a metadata discovery tool to support modelling, (ii) a workflow framework for connecting climate change models, (iii) geographical visualisation tools for communicating landscape and farm impacts, (iv) a landscape object library for storing and sharing digital objects, (v) a landscape constructor tool to support participatory decision-making, and (vi) an online collaboration space for supporting multi-disciplinary research and cross-organisational collaboration.In this paper we present the platform as it has been developed to support collaborative research and to inform stakeholders of the likely impacts of climate change in southwest Victoria, Australia. We discuss some of the drivers for research in developing the ecoinformatics platform and its components. We conclude by identifying some future research directions in better connecting researchers and communicating scientific outcomes in the context of climate change impact and adaptation. Highlights?

Over-fencing of the information commons has led to unaffordable medicine, for want of which millions of Americans and people around the world go without lifesaving treatments. Eliminating patent distribution exclusivity altogether, however, is not feasible, given the entrenched nature of the health-care industry. This paper proposes a program of voluntary Open Science Prizes that would draw large numbers of new players, who would in turn produce much new medical innovation, provide academic priority recognition, and develop a growing body of patent-beating prior art that would serve as public domain firewalls on a new supranational Hyper-Commons.",2317850599,Paul Hynek

By applying an integrative mixed-methods approach drawing on trace ethnography, we place these alleged cases of bot-bot conflict into context and arrive at a better understanding of these interactions. We found that overwhelmingly, the interactions previously characterized as problematic instances of conflict are typically better characterized as routine, productive, even collaborative work. These results challenge past work and show the importance of qualitative/quantitative collaboration. In our paper, we present quantitative metrics and qualitative heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia. We have also released our data collection, processing, and analysis pipeline, to facilitate computational reproducibility of our findings and to help other researchers interested in conducting similar mixed-method scholarship in other platforms and contexts.",2248465365; 1965735689,R.

Furthermore, computer-based tests have often strict copyright licenses or are simple paper-pencil adaptions. To bridge this gap, we introduce COMPROSO—an Open Source web-based software framework for behavioral assessments providing additional benefits over currently available solutions. Web-based testing should provide scholars with the opportunity to share and reintegrate whole tests or single scales in their projects, as well as sharing testing data with others. In addition, it requires—besides privacy, transparency, and versatility—an accessible, scalable, and extensible tool. Hence, a software achieving this, should require an Open Source license, strong modularization and enough versatility for even future tests. Therefore, we designed COMPROSO as a web-based software framework with low system requirements for the server. Tests are optionally included as single (extension) packages. More usual tests can be easily implemented with templates provided. Concurrently, COMPROSO stays flexible enough to include innovative and more complicated or even future features. Currently, several test authors provided their tests within the COMPROSO framework, including performance and personality test scales in English and German. Not all of them are Open Source (or the like) licensed. But we ensured them to be free of charge for scientific purposes. We will demonstrate the operationality of COMPROSO by presenting implementation, administration, management of performance and personality tests. COMPROSO is a proof of concept that psychological assessment, more specifically web-based assessment can be conducted with a consideration of the Open Science idea creating a fruitful synergy for the field of assessment. Furthermore, transparent data collection and management is feasible. As COMPROSO is modularized, its extensibility is only limited to programmable web-based features. We would like to invite the scientific community to participate in the project.",2284062444; 2148230794; 2103701623; 1810518080,Thiemo Kunze; Christoph Kemper; Nicolas Becker; Samuel Greiff

Sadly, result reproducibility is often an overlooked feature accompanying original research publications, competitions and benchmark evaluations. The main reasons behind such a gap arise from natural complications in research and development in this area: the distribution of data may be a sensitive issue; software frameworks are difficult to install and maintain; Test protocols may involve a potentially large set of intricate steps which are difficult to handle. Given the raising complexity of research challenges and the constant increase in data volume, the conditions for achieving reproducible research in the domain are also increasingly difficult to meet. To bridge this gap, we built an open platform for research in computational sciences related to pattern recognition and machine learning, to help on the development, reproducibility and certification of results obtained in the field. By making use of such a system, academic, governmental or industrial organizations enable users to easily and socially develop processing toolchains, re-use data, algorithms, workflows and compare results from distinct algorithms and/or parameterizations with minimal effort. This article presents such a platform and discusses some of its key features, uses and limitations.

Although there are several high quality frameworks for Big Data, additional capabilities are needed for Open Science Big Data. These include data provenance, citable reusable data, data sources providing links to research literature, relationships to other data and theories, transparent analysis/reproducibility, data privacy, new optimizations/advanced algorithms, data curation, data storage and transfer. An important part of science is explanation of results, ideally leading to theory formation. In this paper, we examine means for supporting the use of theory in big data analytics as well as using big data to assist in theory formation. One approach is to fit data in a way that is compatible with some theory, existing or new. Functional Data Analysis allows precise fitting of data as well as penalties for lack of smoothness or even departure from theoretical expectations. This paper discusses principal differential analysis and related techniques for fitting data where, for example, a time-based process is governed by an ordinary differential equation.

Commonly policies requiring open access are framed as expanding access to information and hence as being part of a democratization of society and knowledge production processes. However, there are also other aspects that are part of the way in which open access is commonly imagined in the various policy documents, declarations, and institutional demands that often go unnoticed. This essay wants to foreground some of these issues by asking the overarching question: “What is the problem that open access is seen to solve represented to be?” The paper will discuss how demands to open up access to research align also with an administrative enclosure and managerial processes of control and evaluation. It will show that while demands for free and open access to research publications - created or compiled in research processes funded by public money - are seen as contributing to the knowledge base for advancing society for a common good and in that sense framed as part of a liberating discourse, these demands are also expression of a shift of control of the science community to invisible research infrastructures and to an apparatus of administration as well as subscribing to an ideal of entrepreneurialism as well as continuing a problematic and much criticized understanding of Western science as universal.

As I often tell my students, “If scientific psychology was easy, everyone would do it.” We can take some comfort in knowing that other sciences, too, face similar challenges (e.g., Begley & Ellis, 2012). But our business is with psychology. In August of this year, Science published a fascinating article by Brian Nosek and 269 coauthors (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). They reported direct replication attempts of 100 experiments published in prestigious psychology journals in 2008, including experiments reported in 39 articles in Psychological Science. Although I expect there is room to critique some of the replications, the article strikes me as a terrific piece of work, and I recommend reading it (and giving it to students). For each experiment, researchers prespecified a benchmark finding. On average, the replications had statistical power of .90+ to detect effects of the sizes obtained in the original studies, but fewer than half of them yielded a statistically significant effect. As Nosek and his coauthors made clear, even ideal replications of ideal studies are expected to fail some of the time (Francis, 2012), and failure to replicate a previously observed effect can arise from differences between the original and replication studies and hence do not necessarily indicate flaws in the original study (Maxwell, Lau, & Howard, 2015; Stroebe & Strack, 2014). Still, it seems likely that psychology journals have too often reported spurious effects arising from Type I errors (e.g., Francis, 2014).... Language: en",2164033826,D. Stephen Lindsay

This is characteristic of science-based support for environmental policy at European scale, and key aspects have also long been investigated by European Commission transnational research. Approaches (either of computational science or of policy-making) suitable at a given domain-specific scale may not be appropriate for wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling for environment (WSTMe) and corresponding policy-making. In WSTMe, the characteristic heterogeneity of available spatial information and complexity of the required data-transformation modelling (D-TM) appeal for a paradigm shift in how computational science supports such peculiarly extensive integration processes. In particular, emerging wide-scale integration requirements of typical currently available domain-specific modelling strategies may include increased robustness and scalability along with enhanced transparency and reproducibility. This challenging shift toward open data and reproducible research (open science) is also strongly suggested by the potential - sometimes neglected - huge impact of cascading effects of errors within the impressively growing interconnection among domain-specific computational models and frameworks. Concise array-based mathematical formulation and implementation (with array programming tools) have proved helpful in supporting and mitigating the complexity of WSTMe when complemented with generalized modularization and terse array-oriented semantic constraints. This defines the paradigm of Semantic Array Programming (SemAP) where semantic transparency also implies free software use (although black-boxes - e.g. legacy code - might easily be semantically interfaced). A new approach for WSTMe has emerged by formalizing unorganized best practices and experience-driven informal patterns. The approach introduces a lightweight (non-intrusive) integration of SemAP and geospatial tools - called Geospatial Semantic Array Programming (GeoSemAP). GeoSemAP exploits the joint semantics provided by SemAP and geospatial tools to split a complex D-TM into logical blocks which are easier to check by means of mathematical array-based and geospatial constraints. Those constraints take the form of precondition, invariant and postcondition semantic checks. This way, even complex WSTMe may be described as the composition of simpler GeoSemAP blocks. GeoSemAP allows intermediate data and information layers to be more easily and formally semantically described so as to increase fault-tolerance, transparency and reproducibility of WSTMe. This might also help to better communicate part of the policy-relevant knowledge, often diffcult to transfer from technical WSTMe to the science-policy interface.

The use of agricultural trial and evaluation data has enormous potential to improve crops and management practices. However, for a number of reasons, this potential has yet to be realized. This paper reports on the experience of the AgTrials initiative, an effort to build an online database of agricultural trials applying principles of interoperability and open access. Methods: Our analysis evaluates what worked and what did not work in the development of the AgTrials information resource. We analyzed data on our users and their interaction with the platform. We also surveyed our users to gauge their perceptions of the utility of the online database. Results: The study revealed barriers to participation and impediments to interaction, opportunities for improving agricultural knowledge management and a large potential for the use of trial and evaluation data. Conclusions: Technical and logistical mechanisms for developing interoperable online databases are well advanced.

Adopting an Open Science approach means the audience for the research can extend beyond the researchers involved to other researchers and to members of the public. Thus, Open Science has implications for engineering research, practice, publishing and public engagement with engineering. This paper reviews the history and evolution of the Open Science movement, includes some reflections on the related areas of Open Access, peer-review and public engagement with science and engineering and discusses data gathered from interviews. The analysis suggests that interviewees have concerns about issues such as precedence and protection of original work and the time needed to integrate open science practices into daily work. Successfully working in such collaborations is likely to require not only common practical tools but also the development of shared language and understanding between researchers and members of the public. Interviewees recognise the value of Open Science in collaborative research and its innovative facility to sustain direct public access to research outputs.

However, novel image processing tools to analyze these new rich datasets are lacking. In this article, we introduce the Open Science CBS Neuroimaging Repository: a unique repository of high-resolution and quantitative images acquired at 7 T. The motivation for this project is to increase interest for high-resolution and quantitative imaging and stimulate the development of image processing tools developed specifically for high-field data. Our growing repository currently includes datasets from MP2RAGE and multi-echo FLASH sequences from 28 and 20 healthy subjects respectively. These datasets represent the current state-of-the-art in in-vivo relaxometry at 7 T, and are now fully available to the entire neuroimaging community.",1986241574; 2623593667; 2077070727; 164040429; 2121314384; 1967767072,Christine Tardif; Andreas Schäfer; Robert Trampel; Arno Villringer; Robert Turner; Pierre-Louis Bazin

“Scientists should communicate the data they collect and the models they create, to allow free and open access, and in ways that are intelligible, assessable and usable for other specialists . . . Where data justify it, scientists should make them available in an appropriate data repository.” So said the Royal Society last week, in its report Science as an Open Enterprise: Open Data for Open Science. 1 The report calls for more openness among scientists and with the public and media; greater recognition of the value of data gathering, analysis, and communication; common standards for sharing information to make it widely usable; mandatory publishing of data in a reusable form to support findings; more expertise in managing and supporting the use of digital data; and new software tools to analyse data. It is time for a big shift, says the report, from the status quo where “many scientists still pursue their research through the measured and predictable steps in which they communicate their thinking within relatively closed groups of colleagues; publish their findings, usually in peer reviewed journals; file their data and then move on.”

Scientific research is not exempt from these changes: the free and rapid flow of information, ideas and documents will both require and foster new habits of collaboration among researchers, stimulate economic activities and even improve public dialogue on science (http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/). “A growing body of evidence suggests that public visibility and constructive conversation on social media networks can be beneficial for scientists, impacting research in a number of key ways,” wrote computational biologist Holly Bik and marine biologist Miriam Goldstein [1]. The digital revolution could herald a new era of “open science” where scientists freely and easily share published work, experimental data, ideas and opinions and mutually benefit from the open and collaborative realm that is emerging in the digital age. Yet, not all is brave in the new digital world and scientists seem to be rather reluctant to engage in what the web 2.0 has to offer in terms of exchanging ideas.

Most scientists use social media for two main reasons: networking with other researchers and for public visibility (Fig 1). “Scientists need to be engaged in new media platforms because everyone else is already talking about their thoughts and feelings, having discussions about things they care about, and generally—as the name implies—being social,” commented marine biologist and blogger Christie Wilcox [2]. Beyond making research more visible to funders or policymakers, social media may also help to build dialogue and constructive conversation with the general public, in particularly about sensitive topics, such as stem cell research or genetically modified food. “[W]e have to make a concentrated effort to get involved in the public discussion about science. We have to be approachable and available to talk …",2115273340,Andrea C. Rinaldi

In the years since, the OSG has broadened its focus to also address the needs of other US researchers and increased delivery of Distributed High Through-put Computing (DHTC) to users from a wide variety of disciplines via the OSG Open Facility. Presently, the Open Facility delivers about 100 million computing wall hours per year to researchers who are not already associated with the owners of the computing sites, this is primarily accomplished by harvesting and organizing the temporarily unused capacity (i.e. opportunistic cycles) from the sites in the OSG. Using these methods, OSG resource providers and scientists share computing hours with researchers in many other fields to enable their science, striving to make sure that these computing power used with maximal efficiency. Furthermore, we believe that expanded access to DHTC is an essential tool for scientific innovation and work continues in expanding this service.",2688258855; 2091181715; 2776314591; 2125772623; 2681418265,B Jayatilaka; Tanya Levshina; M Rynge; Chander Sehgal; M Slyz

In particular, publication moratoria and data retention policies have been enacted to ‘reward’ data producers and ensure data quality control. Given the novelty of these policies, this article seeks to identify and analyse the main features of data retention and publication moratoria policies of major genomics institutes and projects around the world. We find that as more collaborative genomics projects are created, and further genomic research discoveries are announced, the need for more sophisticated yet practical and effective policies will increase. Reward systems should be implemented that recognize contributions from data producers and acknowledge the need to remain dedicated to the goals of open data sharing.

Calculation of the cost function for this optimization problem, which can be non-differentiable, necessitates significant computational power and resources. In addition, because of the redundant nature of the human musculoskeletal system, the problem is highly prone to getting stuck in local minima. We have developed a routine using Open Science Grid (OSG), an open source high-throughput computing (HTC) resource, to solve this optimization problem effectively. The developed routine utilizes the computation power of the high-throughput computational resources provided by the OSG to have a powerful optimizer, which reduces the problem of getting stuck in local minima.",2238485631; 2345402638; 2161050935,Mohammadhossein Saadatzi; Anne K.

Three main branches of studies have developed: i) The analysis of the trade-off between open science and the use of IP rights by academic researchers; ii) the Triple Helix model focused on the interactions among University, Industry and Government; iii) the study of the growth of the academic entrepreneurship. A clear disagreement appears regarding the setting of the boundary between public research and market needs. The degree of importance to assign to commercial knowledge splits the academic community. In the knowledge-based economy R&D comes out from the narrow industry boundaries. Once, in order to develop a product it was necessary to gather from knowledge coming from separated fields. In this sense, the knowledge built up in our Universities represents a still unexpressed and highly innovative potential, that, if well organised and structured, could relaunch national firms competitiveness.",2103622918; 2251923588,Poma Lucio; Ramaciotti Laura

The ongoing EU research project OpenScienceLink aims to address these needs, as well as offer a wide range of opportunities for better collaboration between researchers, by introducing a web-based Platform which offers efficient and intelligent applications and services for exploiting open access scientific information in the biomedical domain. The Platform is empowered by the semantic and social networking capabilities of three leading edge background infrastructures, which have been adapted and integrated for the scope of the project. In this paper, we present the five pilot services that are provided by the OpenScienceLink project. All five services are integrated into the web-based OpenScienceLink platform that is publicly accessible at http://www.opensciencelink.org.",2114303091; 2429336616; 2102679180; 2067113401; 2034258830; 278137911,Daniel Eisinger; George Tsatsaronis; Alina Petrova; Efstathios Karanastasis; Vassiliki Andronikou; Efthymios Chondrogiannis

 Design - Observational study.

 Setting - The BMJ research archive.

 Participants - 160 randomly sampled BMJ research articles from 2009 to 2015, excluding meta-analysis and systematic reviews.

 Main outcome measures - Percentages of research articles that indicated the availability of their raw data sets in their data sharing statements, and those that easily made their data sets available on request.

 Results - 3 articles contained the data in the article. 50 out of 157 (32%) remaining articles indicated the availability of their data sets. 12 used publicly available data and the remaining 38 were sent email requests to access their data sets. Only 1 publicly available data set could be accessed and only 6 out of 38 shared their data via email. So only 7/157 research articles shared their data sets, 4.5% (95% CI 1.8% to 9%). For 21 clinical trials bound by the BMJ data sharing policy, the per cent shared was 24% (8% to 47%).

 Conclusions - Despite the BMJ 's strong data sharing policy, sharing rates are low. Possible explanations for low data sharing rates could be: the wording of the BMJ data sharing policy, which leaves room for individual interpretation and possible loopholes; that our email requests ended up in researchers spam folders; and that researchers are not rewarded for sharing their data. It might be time for a more effective data sharing policy and better incentives for health and medical researchers to share their data.",2553280966; 2163373106,Anisa Rowhani-Farid; Adrian G. Barnett

The economics literature addressed specifically to science and its interdependences with technological progress has been quite narrowly focused and has lacked an overarching conceptual framework to guide empirical studies and public policy discussions in this area. The emerging ‘new economics of science’, described by this paper, offers a way to remedy these deficiencies. It makes use of insights from the theory of games of incomplete information to synthesize the classic approach of Arrow and Nelson in examining the implications of the characteristics of information for allocative efficiency in research activities, on the one hand, with the functionalist analysis of institutional structures, reward systems and behavioral norms of ‘open science’ communities-associated with the sociology of science in the tradition of Merton-on the other. An analysis is presented of the gross features of the institutions and norms distinguishing open science from other modes of organizing scientific research, which shows that the collegiate reputation-based reward system functions rather well in satisfying the requirement of social efficiency in increasing the stock of reliable knowledge. At a more fine-grain level of examination, however, the detailed workings of the system based on the pursuit of priority are found to cause numerous inefficiencies in the allocation of basic and applied science resources, both within given fields and programs and across time. Another major conclusion, arrived at in the context of examining policy measures and institutional reforms proposed to promote knowledge transfers between university-based open science and commercial R&D, is that there are no economic forces that operate automatically to maintain dynamic efficiency in the interactions of these two (organizational) spheres. Ill-considered institutional experiments, which destroy their distinctive features if undertaken on a sufficient scale, may turn out to be very costly in terms of long-term economic performance.",2021679104; 2584665884,Dasgupta Partha; Paul A.

Universities are increasingly becoming commercial actors, particularly in terms of performing licensing activities and investing in ventures. As universities take on new roles and develop new practices for commodifying new knowledge into licenses or new ventures, questions arise about the future role and idea of universities as such, as well as around the actual practical and managerial consequences. However, if universities are to walk down paths of commodification at all  and strong defacto arguments for this can be made today  there is reason to search for a new intellectual infrastructure of universities, in which the commercial roles and practices of universities can converge and make sense in the knowledge economy. While providing two significantly different case illustrations  Columbia University in New York and Chalmers in Sweden  with some converging trends, the paper conceptualizes elements of a new university infrastructure both in terms of the role played and norms applied, as well as in terms of an object-oriented process for commodifying inventions into intellectual property (IP).",2082866085; 2342988677,Mats Lundqvist; Karen Williams

The predictability norms for the Provo Corpus differ from those of other corpora. In addition to traditional cloze scores that estimate the predictability of the full orthographic form of each word, the Provo Corpus also includes measures of the predictability of the morpho-syntactic and semantic information for each word. This makes the Provo Corpus ideal for studying predictive processes in reading. Some analyses using these data have previously been reported elsewhere (Luke & Christianson, 2016).

The papers proposed a surprisingly simple new method called stimulus-triggered acquisition of pluripotency (STAP) to generate pluripotent stem cells for research purposes in a fast and inexpensive way. To the dismay of many, both papers were retracted within six months of their release due to data fabrication and falsification. The rise and fall of the STAP research illustrates the impacts of open science practices of quality control and validation on new scientific claims. In the STAP case, collective action generated through two online forums—the Knoepfler Lab Stem Cell Blog and PubPeer—exposed not only data manipulation in the two papers but also the irreproducibility of the purported new cellular reprogramming method. The case brings to the fore the tentative possibilities as well as potential pitfalls of ‘accelerated virtual witnessing’ through crowdsourced post...",1302567992; 2115843170; 2611865220,Mianna Meskus; Luca Marelli; Giuseppe D'Agostino

It exists to facilitate interdisciplinary teamwork and to relieve the user from data overload, delivering access to information that is highly relevant and focused on their topic areas of interest. Research topics include areas of chemistry and adjacent molecule-oriented biomedical sciences, with an emphasis on those which are most amenable to open research at present. These include rare and neglected diseases, and precompetitive and public-good initiatives such as green chemistry. The ODDT project uses a free mobile app as user entry point. The app has a magazine-like interface, and server-side infrastructure for hosting chemistry-related data as well as value added services. The project is open to participation from anyone and provides the ability for users to make annotations and assertions, thereby contributing to the collective value of the data to the engaged community. Much of the content is derived from public sources, but the platform is also amenable to commercial data input. The technology could also be readily used in-house by organizations as a research aggregator that could integrate internal and external science and discussion. The infrastructure for the app is currently based upon the Twitter API as a useful proof of concept for a real time source of publicly generated content. This could be extended further by accessing other APIs providing news and data feeds of relevance to a particular area of interest. As the project evolves, social networking features will be developed for organizing participants into teams, with various forms of communication and content management possible.",211892740; 2116819027; 2120589406,Sean Ekins; Alex M.

Open Science, e- Science , Open Data and Big Data as new concepts that have been describing in recent years affecting science and the way in which it takes place. Current events often involves a broad conceptual framework or diffuse , depending on the discipline and the vision itself. Are we facing a disruptive innovation or new methodological ways to in the scientific method? We can therefore ask whether there are two parallel processes. Does scientific collaboration involved in these emerging scientific disciplines and to what extent ? How science more open , more collaborative , or do other things to consider?

A priori , it can be considered that the concept of Open Science overlaps properly with scientific collaboration , since broad vision and relationship between academia himself and the professional world, but it is considered the scientific literature and the authors collected this vision. Do not be looking at all Open Science project supports and maintains scientific collaboration ? Is the generation of new knowledge prepared for these new forms ?

The communication will be presented , with the intent to answer the above research questions , the coincident conceptual framework between these new concepts and their differences are discussed , including the implications of the new processes , as often overlap displayed their meanings also marked by the different areas in which to generate these trends. The contribution of these different views must end coinciding creative alternative models of knowledge creation .

Also, some results of bibliometric studies will be presented as a proposal display which of the more traditional disciplines use these new ways of generating scientific knowledge. I mean, what disciplines are betting more on these new ways of generating science (and collaboration ) and to what extent ?

It promotes open access to the artefacts of research, the software, data, results and the scientific articles in which they appear, so that others can validate, use and collaborate. Open Science is also being mandated by many funding bodies. The concept of Open Science is new to many Modelling & Simulation (M&S) researchers. To introduce Open Science to our field, this paper unpacks Open Science to understand some of its approaches and benefits. Good practice in the reporting of simulation studies is discussed and the Strengthening the Reporting of Empirical Simulation Studies (STRESS) standardized checklist approach is presented. A case study shows how Digital Object Identifiers, Researcher Registries, Open Access Data Repositories and Scientific Gateways can support Open Science practices for M&S research. The article concludes with a set of guidelines for adopting Open Science for M&S.",2117970220; 1963988368; 2422416332; 2045396177; 2093889978; 2614142825; 2170994414,Simon J. E.

The evidence continues to support the broad interpretation which we call the ”Stanford-Yale-Sussex” synthesis. Second, such patterns bear important implications with respect to the so-called ”European Paradox”, i.e. the conjecture that EU countries play a leading global role in terms of top-level scientific output, but lag behind in the ability of converting this strength into wealth-generating innovations. Some descriptive evidence shows that, contrary to the ”paradox” conjecture, European weaknesses reside both in its system of scientific research and in a relatively weak industry. The final part of the work suggests a few normative implications: much less emphasis should be put on various types of ”networking” and much more on policy measures aimed to both strengthen ”frontier” research and strengthen European corporate actors.",2074039265; 2101870075; 2209664278,Giovanni Dosi; Patrick Llerena; Mauro Sylos-Labini

Seeking to accelerate research advances and reimagine its role in the community, the Montreal Neurological Institute (Neuro) announced in the spring of 2016 that it is launching a five-year experiment during which it will adopt Open Science—open data, open materials, and no patenting—across the institution. The experiment seeks to examine two hypotheses. The first is whether the Neuro’s Open Science initiative will attract new private partners. The second hypothesis is that the Neuro’s institution-based approach will draw companies to the Montreal region, where the Neuro is based, leading to the creation of a local knowledge hub. This article explores why these hypotheses are likely to be true and describes the Neuro’s approach to exploring them.",2133191819,E. Richard Gold

Data were obtained for 153 HEIs’ expenditure with ten publishers over a five-year period. The majority of institutions have provided figures but some are still outstanding.

At the hospital, the West of Scotland medical and industrial communities came together to mend broken bodies with prosthetic technology, as well as physical and mental rehabilitation to prepare the limbless to re-enter the job market. This paper explores the establishment of manual therapy workshops at Erskine and how such programmes of vocational rehabilitation were culturally informed by the concerns and anxieties of both the military and civilian populations of the First World War-era.",2105247126,Jennifer Novotny

The Research Data Alliance (RDA), which is developing an open Internet platform structured much like the World Wide Web, aims to enable greater collaboration among scientists of all disciplines and from all parts of the globe through the use and reuse of data. Its mission, say the founders, is to unlock the innovation potential of research data by encouraging and enabling scientists to publish the data underlying their research results. The move comes amid growing demands in the research community for tools that allow researchers not only to share their data, but also to manage and make use of the huge volumes of data being generated through literally billions of computers, sensors, and other connected devices--a development known as Big Data. The aim, said John Wood, the European Union cochairman of the RDA, speaking in a recent webinar, is to ensure that when scientists seek access to the data of their peers, ""this data is available to them in a format they can use."" RDA, which was supported in its earlier stages by Europe, the United States, and Australia, faces no shortage of challenges, experts agree. The technical challenges begin with the need for a common framework to assure interoperability. For instance, the various elements of this new scientists' web--the various codes, policies, standards, and practices--need to be harmonized to allow data sharing. And that infrastructure, says Francine Berman, who chairs the RDA in the United States, needs to span not only countries and continents, but also scientific disciplines and industrial sectors--""anywhere there is interest in data-driven innovation, which is practically everywhere."" Then there are the various responses to the idea of sharing. Scientists, commercial research interests, and governments are at odds on the issue. A growing number of governments in industrialized nations are demanding open access to research outputs from publicly funded research and development projects. In 2012, for instance, the European Commission committed to the Open Data movement, arguing that information already paid for by taxpayers ""should not be paid for again each time it is accessed or used"" and should benefit European businesses and citizens ""to the full."" In February, the U.S. government announced a new open-access policy requiring publications from taxpayer-funded research to be made free to read after a year's delay. That policy expands the National Institutes of Health (NIH) approach, which, until now, has applied only to work in the biomedical sciences. The White House move came just a week after FASTR (Fair Access to Science and Technology Research), a bill that would speed release of publicly funded research to just six months and expand the reach of the policy, was introduced in the U.S Congress. Within the EU, the United Kingdom has led the way, declaring that all research funded through the nation's research councils must be made freely and openly available to anyone around the world; the policy went into effect on April 1, 2013. Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda, spoke about the era of open science at a recent forum. ""Only when results and evidence are shared can the community examine and compare, discard, and learn,"" she said. ""There can be no modern science without sharing. We are putting openness at the heart of EU research and innovation funding."" Farnam Jahanian, director of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering directorate at the U.S. government's National Science Foundation (NSF), shares a similar view. ""We need policies for data sharing and open access,"" he said in March at the RDA launch. …",2147515083,John Blau

In particular, as Paul David has often argued, the “open science” community has evolved a rather different approach to rewards for and spillovers from the production of information goods than that suggested by a conventional economic property rights analysis, one based on rapid publication and dissemination in order to achieve a prior claim as the inventor. Because this kind of system for securing rewards to investments in research is so different from that to which most industrial firms operate, it is not surprising that tensions arise in settings where the conventions of one world (private industry) come up against the conventions of another (public R&D and university science). The paper reviews the evidence that this is the case and then discusses the case of cumulative innovation, where the IP problem is particularly salient.",2152434761,Bronwyn H. Hall

The emerging questions have resulted in a number of studies, yielding rich but mixed findings. The purpose of this paper is to systematically review this body of investigative work, with a particular emphasis on life sciences. Based on the systematic analysis and synthesis of 135 articles published between 1980 and 2014, we discuss the most interesting findings for each of the six identified principal academic-industry research topics: involvement predictors and motivators, role of incentives, institutional performance determinants, knowledge transfer institutionalization, relationship with scientific output and impact on open science. Whereas many studies reach consensus regarding the particular personal and contextual predictors of researchers’ knowledge transfer involvement, we also find substantial evidence that depending on empirical setting, variables such as scientific productivity and institutional technology transfer support policies can act both as enablers and inhibitors in the process. We find no straightforward evidence regarding the role of the size, age and structure of technology transfer offices in the knowledge transfer performance of academic institutions. We also show that most studies agree that engagement in knowledge transfer activities does not negatively affect the researchers’ scientific output. Yet, it is less clear to what extent university-industry interactions can be detrimental for the norms of open science. We draw several policy implications for academic settings and emphasize interesting avenues for further research in this field.",2484669607; 2127737094,Ani Gerbin; Mateja Drnovsek

They are the defining features of tic disorders including Tourette syndrome, but many people have them for shorter durations at some point in childhood. This editorial marks the beginning of the F1000Research: Tics specialty section, an effort to provide a single portal to modern research on tics and tic disorders. Publications in F1000Research: Tics benefit from F1000Research’s novel approach to publishing, in which articles can be published within days of submission. Peer review happens after publication and is fully open. When the submitted article or a revision is approved, it is promptly submitted to repositories including NIH’s PubMed Central. In addition to research articles and reviews, F1000Research: Tics will publish study protocols, clinical practice articles, case reports, and data notes. The home page will also provide links to expert recommendations of articles that have appeared elsewhere, and to relevant posters from scientific meetings (http://f1000.com/posters/). F1000Research’s approach is enabled by the capabilities of internet publication, including space to publish the full results of a study rather than just a few graphs selected from the data. Publishing methodologically sound studies without requiring subjective editorial judgments of novelty or broad appeal brings numerous advantages, including minimizing publication bias and shining the light of openness on peer review. To celebrate the launch of the Tics section, F1000Research is offering discounted article processing charges for manuscripts submitted by March 1st 2015. I have had good experiences publishing in F1000Research, and look forward to seeing a wide range of tic-related manuscripts submitted.",2134091528,Kevin J. Black

Increasingly, scientific communities are making information tools accessible as services that clients can access over the network, without knowledge of their internal workings. In this way, tools formerly accessible only to the specialist can be made available to all. Equally importantly, new value-added services can be constructed that integrate other services to automate useful tasks. The value of such service-oriented science has been demonstrated in disciplines as diverse as astronomy, biology, and fusion science. The mechanisms required to achieve these goals are provided, in part, by grid infrastructure. I review the mechanisms that have been developed to date for grid infrastructure and experience gained implementing these mechanisms, for example within the open source Globus Toolkit version 4. I present a range of dynamic service deployment scenarios, in which for example the TeraGrid and Open Science Grid are used to host services for science communities. I discuss how these scenarios demonstrate the potential for scaling service-oriented science",2017222965,Ian T. Foster

These resources have the potential to support technology-enhanced science education by enabling science teachers to improve their day-to-day science teaching. Nevertheless, it has been identified that science teachers could benefit from their participation in communities of best science teaching practices by sharing, not only digital educational resources, but also learning designs that represent their pedagogical practice. This hasled to efforts on moving beyond web-based repositories of digital educational resources towards the development of web-based repositories of learning designs. Within this framework, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of three (3) European initiatives, which aim to support and facilitate open access to Educational Resources and Learning Designs in the field of Science Education, namely, the Open Science Resources Repository, the COSMOS Repository and the PATHWAY Coordination and Support Action.",2137498179; 2086626606; 2055071946,Demetrios G.

Based on scientific interest, these new virtual research collaborations can cut across traditional boundaries such as institutions and organizations. Advances in technology allow for software tools that can be used by different research groups and institutions to build and support virtual collaborations and infuse open science. This paper describes Talkoot, a software toolkit designed and developed by the authors to provide Earth Science researchers a ready-to-use knowledge management environment and an online platform for collaboration. Talkoot allows Earth Science researchers a means to systematically gather, tag and share their data, analysis workflows and research notes. These Talkoot features are designed to foster rapid knowledge sharing within a virtual community. Talkoot can be utilized by small to medium sized groups and research centers, as well as large enterprises such a national laboratories and federal agencies.",2156811270; 2164426663; 2145145432; 693572135; 2116077824; 1498728755,Rahul Ramachandran; Manil Maskey; Ajinkya Kulkarni; Helen Conover; Udaysankar S.

The estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6% ± 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals’ editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results imply that researchers’ awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders’ policies in achieving very high sharing rates. Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.",1973107688; 2066956233; 2312185609; 2025784664; 1081426612; 2609886121; 1978554192,Paolo Anagnostou; Marco Capocasa; Nicola Milia; Emanuele Sanna; Cinzia Battaggia; Daniela Luzi; Giovanni Destro Bisol

A brief scan of a newspaper or quick Internet search reveals it as a prefix to learning, source, standard, data, knowledge, democracy, access, repository, innovation, government, science and probably more. The expectations of the broadband generation--young people born around the turn of the century--for openness and instant, on-demand access to information (1) affect research as much as any other social activity. As the world's population of digital residents--those who see the Web as the place where they express opinions, form relationships, develop an identity and belong to a community (2)--grows, the expectation that the Web will be the place where information is created and communicated will grow alongside them. In response, the media have become hydra-headed and researchers have become public intellectuals in unforeseen ways: online editions of what we used to call newspapers include comment pages, blogs, and links to journal papers (3), citizen journalism thrives, radio and television programmes sprout links to university websites, educational material and background material, and no self-respecting research project seems complete without its website and social media accounts. However, while these and other routes seem to offer interested viewers the chance (paraphrasing Newton) to peer over the giants' shoulders and see what they're doing in their ivory fortresses, those attempting this feat can find themselves routinely frustrated by blocked access, paywalls, out-of-date websites, subscription demands and curtailed documents. In the UK, USA, Europe and Australasia, since the mid-twentieth century, scientists have increasingly demonstrated a willingness to engage with the public (and indeed, members of the public shown a willingness to engage with science). Over time, the labels have changed: scientific literacy, public understanding of science, scientific culture, public awareness of science, science communication, public engagement with science (4,5) but the interaction has always tended to be after the research is over and the researchers can show the public a clean, crystalline sphere of perfected results. Science is not like that, as scientists know; real research is messy, tentative and dynamic. To see its real creativity and inventiveness, we need to see the scientist in action in the laboratory, banging the test tubes together (6). 'Open science', which Neilsen (p.32) defines (7) as the sharing of 'everything--data, scientific opinions, questions, ideas, folk knowledge, workflows and everything else as it happens' (8) is an emerging approach to the practice of science, in which the whole research process is conducted in the open, from formulating research questions, to designing methodologies, to publishing data and results. This wholly open approach, sometimes called 'open notebook science' (9) is, in practice, followed by only a relatively small group of strong advocates (10). However, many researchers are happy to be open with certain aspects of their work: publishing in open access journals (which is becoming more common, especially as funders increasingly make this a condition of grants); depositing copies of publications in open institutional repositories or disciplinary archives (such as arXiv.org for maths and physics); maintaining websites, writing research blogs, contributing to social citation services and communicating about their work on social media. In fact, many of the behaviours that make research open can be seen as extensions or an evolution of day-to-day work: the paper notebook is replaced by an electronic version, from which data can be automatically collated and made to flow on to a project website; a research log becomes a research blog, enhanced by a blog's ability to support dialogue through comments and responses; documents are collaboratively created and the common room chat migrates to social media. …",2114433508,Ann Grand

Today academic teams in different places can collaborate in virtual environments by conducting scholarly work on the Internet. Two relevant dimensions that have been deeply affected by the emergence of digital scholarship are new facets of knowledge generation (wikis, e-science, online education, distributed R&D, open innovation, open science, peer-based production, online encyclopedias, user generated content) and new models of knowledge circulation and distribution (e-journals, open repositories, open licenses, academic podcasting initiatives, etc.). Despite the potential transformation of these novel practices and mechanisms of knowledge production and distribution, some authors suggest that digital scholarship can only be of significance if it marks a radical break in scholarship practices brought about through the possibilities enabled in new technologies. This paper address some of the key challenges and raise a set of recommendations to foster the development of key skills, new models of collaboration and cross-disciplinary cooperation between digital scholars.",2142451846; 1587380424,Cristobal Cobo; Concepción Naval

However, if the science of sport is to achieve a prominent standing, new problems must be faced. Sport is developing into an open system in that its boundaries to other fields (economy, media, etc.) and to other forms of spare-time activity (e.g. tourism, entertainment) have become blurred. The consequence must be the development of an open science of sport. New groups of people are becoming interested in sports, and new innovative models of sport activity must be developed for them. With new strategies of planning, new forms of sport activity must be organized and realized. Emerging from these elements is the concept of the science of sport as an open, innovative, planning science.",2257798764,Klaus Heinemann

PLoS ONE 12(1): e0169711. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0169711 Editor: Ulrich von Hecker, Cardiff University, UNITED KINGDOM Abstract We report a design study that assessed the feasibility of Enacted Reading Comprehension (ERC), an intervention designed to teach 3 rd and 4 th grade students (n = 40 and 25, respec- tively) to use gestures to understand an increasingly abstract set of texts. Students were taught to use gestures to understand the idea of “opposing forces” in a concrete setting–the forces at play as tectonic plates move past each other–and then taught to use the gestures to understand opposing forces in more abstract situations. For example, students were taught to use gestures to understand the opposing sides of an argument, and to understand the internal conflicts that arise as individuals are faced with moral dilemmas. The results of our design study suggest that ERC has promise as a method for introducing students to the idea of using gesture to understand text content, and to employ this strategy in a range of reading contexts.

Introduction Whether having a conversation with friends, flipping through a magazine to pass the time on an airplane, or poring over a text to study for an exam, the creation of meaning lies at the heart of language use [1, 2]. The centrality of meaning and understanding to the use of language has been an important impetus behind the recent surge of interest in developing approaches and interven- tions to improve comprehension performance in school-age readers [3]. Compared to the great strides that have been made in improving some aspects of children’s literacy skills (such as the decoding processes needed to translate between orthographic symbols and phonological repre- sentations) [4], comparatively little progress has been made in improving comprehension skills [5]. Initiatives such as the Institute for Education Sciences’ Reading for Understanding (RFU) project (which funded the work reported here) have served to highlight the need to understand both the processes involved in reading comprehension, and the mechanisms through which teachers can intervene to support the development of comprehension skills in those students who struggle in this area. One Reading for Understanding Network team [6] has presented a multi-faceted approach to improving children’s reading comprehension abilities.

Jaguar was the first petascale system to be deployed for open science and has been one of the world's top three supercomputers for six releases of the TOP500 list. Its workload is investigated here as a representative of the growing worldwide install base of petascale systems and also as a foreshadowing of science workloads to be expected for future systems. The study considers characteristics of the Jaguar workload such as resource utilization, typical job characteristics, most heavily used applications, application scaling and application usage patterns. Implications of these findings are considered for current petascale workflows and for exascale systems to be deployed later this decade.",2310898344; 2125104115,Wayne Joubert; Shi-Quan Su

Using responses to a series of attitudinal questions about academic entrepreneurship and commercialization of the university from a National Survey of Technology Transfer Office directors and faculty in the United States, we explain the variation in attitudes among faculty by academic discipline, by type of university and by previous experience as an entrepreneur. We compare the attitudes of faculty to the attitudes of technology transfer office directors to gauge the width of the gap between these two groups of stakeholders. The empirical results provide strong evidence that the commercialization of the university is by no means yet ‘taken for granted’.",2124197316,Harvey Goldstein

Detailed data on the decisions of 1,694 bio-scientists allow to detect similarities and differences between academia-based and industry-based scientists. Arguments from social capital theory are applied to explain why individuals share information even at (temporary) personal cost. In both realms, the results suggest that the likelihood of sharing decreases with the competitive value of the requested information. Factors related to social capital, i.e., expected reciprocity and the extent to which a scientist’s community conforms to the norm of open science, either directly affect information-sharing or moderate competitive interest considerations on information-sharing. The effect depends on the system to which a scientist belongs.",2062945787,Carolin Haeussler

However, typical project databases often refer to only one research project and are limited to specific purposes. Once implemented, those systems are often not further maintained and updated, rendering the stored information useless once the system stops operating. The River Basin Information System (RBIS) presented here is designed to fit not only the requirements of one research project, but focuses on generic functions, extensibility and standards compliance typically found in interdisciplinary environmental research. Developed throughout more than 10 years of research cooperation worldwide, RBIS is designed to manage different types of environmental data with and without spatial context together with a rich set of metadata. Beside data management and storage, RBIS provides functions for the visualization, linking, analysis and processing of different types of data to support research, decision making, result dissemination and information discovery for all kinds of users. The focus of this paper is on the description of the technical implementation and the presentation of functions. This will be complemented by an overview of example applications and experiences during RBIS development and operation.",2149992336; 1939235583,Franziska Zander; Sven Kralisch

This anomaly may be related to aerosols derived from biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) and the related aerosol direct and indirect radiative effects. To understand the causal relationships that result in this trend, the scientific community must ask, What sources and processes control the fate of biogenic compounds in anthropogenically influenced environments? What are the climate-relevant properties and air quality impacts? Approximately 30 atmospheric scientists with experimental (field and laboratory) and modeling backgrounds met to discern the most critical open science questions regarding biosphere-atmosphere interactions. An objective of the meeting was to formulate targeted science questions and broadly discuss the tools, approaches, and measurements needed to answer them.",2338711352,Annmarie G. Carlton

The development of tools often lags behind the proliferation of data, however, which may slow exploratory opportunities and scientific progress. The Global Lake Ecological Observatory Network (GLEON) collaborative model supports an efficient and comprehensive data–analysis–insight life cycle, including implementations of data quality control checks, statistical calculations/derivations, models, and data visualizations. These tools are community-built and openly shared. We discuss the network structure that enables tool development and a culture of sharing, leading to optimized output from limited resources. Specifically, data sharing and a flat collaborative structure encourage the development of tools that enable scientific insights from these data. Here we provide a cross-section of scientific advances derived from global-scale analyses in GLEON. We document enhancements to science capabilities made possible by the development of analytical tools and highlight opportunities to expand this framework to benefit other environmental networks.",2143581872; 2133826520; 2101395623; 2141580726; 2016211335; 2193743403; 2596583925; 2149727138; 1170991011; 2151290987; 2735677181; 2119337865,Jordan S.

However, with the increasing complexities of new technologies and techniques, coupled with the specialisation of experiments, reproducing research findings has become a growing challenge. Clearly, scientific methods must be conveyed succinctly, and with clarity and rigour, in order for research to be reproducible. Here, we propose steps to help increase the transparency of the scientific method and the reproducibility of research results: specifically, we introduce a peer-review oath and accompanying manifesto. These have been designed to offer guidelines to enable reviewers (with the minimum friction or bias) to follow and apply open science principles, and support the ideas of transparency, reproducibility and ultimately greater societal impact. Introducing the oath and manifesto at the stage of peer review will help to check that the research being published includes everything that other researchers would need to successfully repeat the work. Peer review is the lynchpin of the publishing system: encouraging the community to consciously (and conscientiously) uphold these principles should help to improve published papers, increase confidence in the reproducibility of the work and, ultimately, provide strategic benefits to authors and their institutions.",2191844294; 2709499527; 2779049164; 2061691810; 1486133712; 2291158056; 2156533165; 2154572072; 1995262555; 2304148772; 2717735976; 2469223817; 1968380653; 241772991; 2331026821; 2131874983; 2163342400; 2583966270,Jelena Aleksic; Jean-Karim Hériché; Leo Lahti; Daniel MacLean; Michael Markie; Jenny Molloy; Maria Victoria Schneider; Camille Scott; Richard Smith-Unna; Bruno Vieira; Adrian Alexa; Teresa K.

Traditionally, the dissemination of knowledge derived from clinical research has been limited in scope: Investigators who have designed and conducted clinical trials make the decisions about which statistical analyses to conduct and then publish peer-reviewed articles to disseminate their findings. Clinical trial data are considered the property of the investigators and the entities that sponsored the research, with little or no opportunity for investigators external to the original study team to access the data. This traditional model is based on dissemination via print publication, the origins of which date back to the 17th century.

By continued adherence to this model in the age of electronic knowledge exchange, our understanding of clinical interventions is limited by our lack of access to comprehensive data from all clinical trials in several ways. First, a select number of individuals decide which analyses to conduct, choosing some at the exclusion of others, while an analysis that might have been of great interest to another investigator (and which may have a direct bearing on clinical practice) may not be performed. Second, among these findings generated, a select number might be included in any peer-reviewed publication, leaving the research community and clinicians at a loss to know about findings generated but not disseminated. In fact, by comparing published articles with trial protocols, 50% of efficacy and 65% of harm outcomes per trial have been shown to be incompletely reported and biased toward the reporting of statistically significant findings.1 Third, among all trials conducted, there may be significant publication delays, as happened with the Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia …",2142156483; 2226129036; 2123887622,Joseph S.

Puo la scienza aperta contrastare la mercificazione della ricerca e curare i mali che essa genera? La risposta e positiva, purche si intenda la scienza aperta non solo come accesso gratuito e con diritti di riuso ma come un sistema di valori come la democrazia, la trasparenza, l’equita, la cooperazione e l’integrita morale. In questa prospettiva, per lo sviluppo della scienza aperta serve soprattutto l’insegnamento. Occorre formare le nuove generazioni di scienziati insegnando loro i valori e le tecniche dell’Open Science. Anche le policy e le norme formali possono aiutare a creare un contesto utile all’affermazione della scienza aperta. In particolare, occorre incidere sulle regole e sulle prassi di valutazione allo scopo di decentrare e rendere trasparente il potere decisionale, e necessario altresi riscrivere le leggi sul copyright con la finalita di dare maggiore liberta a chi vuole accedere alla scienza e riutilizzarla. Queste misure possono contribuire a creare un nuovo ecosistema di comunicazione dove l’interazione tra etica, norme formali e tecnologia possa garantire il pluralismo delle fonti e degli intermediari.

English Abstract: The aim of this short essay is to answer the following question: is Open Science (OS) able to oppose the expansion of commodification of scientific and academic research? The answer is positive only if we conceive OS not only as free access to and reuse of scientific outputs (publications and data), but also as a broader system of values such as democracy, transparency, equity, cooperation, and moral integrity. From this perspective, fostering OS also means investing energy in teaching. We need to educate the new generation of scientists by teaching them the values and practices of OS. In addition, policy and formal norms can help us to build a legal environment apt to embrace the OS principles. In particular, we have to adjust the current research assessment system by decentralising the evaluation process and making it transparent. Moreover, we need to reform copyright law to enable more freedom to access to and reuse of scientific contents. All these efforts may generate a new communication ecosystem in which interaction among ethics, formal norms and technology would guarantee the pluralism of sources and intermediaries.",2111890350,Roberto Caso

However, while the open science community engenders many similar scientific services, how to differentiate them remains a challenge. This paper proposes a trust model that leverages the implicit human factor to help quantify the trustworthiness of candidate services. A hierarchical Knowledge-Social-Trust (KST) network model is established to draw hidden information from various publication repositories (e.g., DBLP) and social networks (e.g., Twitter). As a proof of concept, a prototyping service has been developed to help scientists evaluate and visualize trust of services.

The initiative's goal is to provide professional development and mentoring experiences that facilitate the advancement of minorities committed to achieving outstanding Earth system science careers. The 2003 MS PHD'S in Ocean Sciences Program facilitated the meaningful engagement of 25 student participants at the final Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) Open Science Meeting. During the 2004 American Geophysical Union (AGU) fall meeting, the MS PHD'S initiative completed Phase I of its newest endeavor, entitled the MS PHD'S Professional Development Program (MS PHD'S PDP), The 3 MS PHD'S PDP phases are connected by engagement in virtual community building activities that occur through the Website, listserv and asynchronous/ synchronous Web-based dialogues. Leveraging computer mediated communication to enhance peer to peer and peer to protege mentoring is one of the best practices explored in detailed in this paper. Students who successfully complete all three phases and virtual community activities of the MS PHD'S PDP will be better prepared to achieve their academic and professional goals and will likely remain actively engaged in their fields of specialization and respective professional societies.

Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing results for decision makers.
Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contributions to a larger picture.
To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic information about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many published papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses.
We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolutionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible.
These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.",2014441093; 2073854329; 1978048194; 2032386057; 2784118265; 2147878630; 2035403735,Katharina Gerstner; David Moreno-Mateos; Jessica Gurevitch; Michael Beckmann; Stephan Kambach; Holly P.

Our objective is to shed light on some of the most vexing, yet under-researched predicaments research institutions encounter, despite their best efforts to advance commercialization. First, we synthesize and extend recent studies, including the papers in the special themed section. Next, we develop a taxonomy of modes of commercialization. Specifically, we consider internal approaches, quasi-internal approaches (e.g. incubators), university research parks, regional clusters, academic spin-offs and start-ups, licensing, contract research and consultancy, corporate venture capital, and open science and innovation. We also identify areas for further research at the individual (e.g. heterogeneity of entrepreneurial teams and experience; incentives), organizational and intra-university (e.g. corporate governance; nature of growth strategies; relationships with trading partners; boundary spanning activities) and technology levels (e.g. institutional context; reconfiguration of technology; valuation of technology).",2571521669; 2176089339; 2107926365,Gideon D.

Various species of certain developed taxa, such as fish, quadrupeds, and butterflies, are currently able to be photographically identified, in particular for ecological and biogeographic studies. However, there are problems that result from registration of images from countries with different primary languages. In this study, we provide an example of the challenges associated with registering fish images, specifically one case that has functioned as a voucher for the range extension of Labrisomus jenkinsi (Heller and Snodgrass, 1903) (Perciformes: Labrisomidae) from the Galapagos Islands to the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. The fish image database in question belongs to a Japanese public museum [the Kanagawa Prefectural Museum of Natural History; the online version (FishPix) is provided by the museum and the National Museum of Nature and Science]. We propose that there are problems associated with image registration caused by using different languages. Furthermore, these challenges should be a common subject for discussion among museums as they attempt to accumulate biodiversity data from citizens in the future.",2044743705; 2285737172; 2560396032; 2114122227; 2193319180,Yusuke Miyazaki; Atsunobu Murase; Ryosuke Sahara; Arturo Angulo; Hiroshi Senou

Literature excerpts are widely used in MH programs in developed nations. In Nepal English language literature excerpts had been used previously in two modules. Problems noted were difficulty in comprehending the excerpts and relating them to the Nepalese scenario. The MH module for the 2011 intake was conducted from December 2011 to March 2012. The present study was conducted in the third week of March to obtain student perceptions about use of literature excerpts and suggestions for further improvement using a questionnaire. Literature excerpts used in the module dealt with Nepal and health-related topics. Sixty-eight of the 80 students (85%) participated in the study. The majority were male, self-financing and from urban areas. Respondents felt the excerpts introduced them to different aspects of the medical profession, prepared them for future practice, and underscored the importance of understanding the patients’ feelings. The literature excerpts with which they could identify the most and the least were noted. There were no differences in median enjoyment and effectiveness scores of the literature excerpts according to subgroups of respondents. The suggested benefits of using literature in medical education were similar to those reported previously. Most respondents were able to appreciate the English language excerpts. They felt that Nepali language excerpts and those by Nepali writers could also be included. The findings would be of interest to educators in other developing nations introducing MH modules.",2336524574; 2762667347; 2076446300; 2125764864; 2402207296,P Ravi Shankar; Kundan K Singh; Ajaya Kumar Dhakal; Arati Shakya; Rano Piryani

Our focus is on social sciences and humanities. As research data gradually become a crucial topic of scientific communication and evaluation, current research information systems must be able to consider and manage the great variety and granularity levels of data as sources and results of scientific research. More empirical and moreover conceptual work is needed to increase our understanding of the reality of research data and the way they can and should be used for the needs and objectives of research evaluation. The paper contributes to the debate on the evaluation of research data, especially in the environment of open science and open data, and will be helpful in implementing CRIS and research data policies.",102885235; 2009713239; 2414542830,Joachim Schöpfel; Hélène Prost; Violaine Rebouillat

The emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of “open science"" was a distinctive organizational aspect of the Scientific Revolution. It represented a new set of norms, incentives, and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. The rise of “cooperative rivalries” in the revelation of new knowledge, is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the Renaissance system of court-patronage of the arts and sciences. In late Renaissance Europe, the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority had resulted in relations between noble patrons and their savant-clients that resembled the situation modern economists describe as ""common agency contracting in substitutes""—competition among incompletely informed principals for the dedicated services of multiple agents.",2584665884,Paul A.

The number and complexity of functional interactions within the connectome and the large amounts of data required to study them position functional connectivity research as a “big data” problem. Maximizing the degree to which knowledge about human brain function can be extracted from the connectome will require developing a new generation of neuroimaging analysis algorithms and tools. This review describes several outstanding problems in brain functional connectomics with the goal of engaging researchers from a broad spectrum of data sciences to help solve these problems.

Building “good fences” does not make for “good (more productive) neighbors” in science. Balance needs to be maintained between the “open science” mode of research, and private proprietary R&D, because at the macro-system level the functions that each is well-suited to serve are complementary. Recent policy initiatives, particularly by the EC in relation to the legal protection of property rights in database, pose a serious threat to the utility of collaboratively consttructed digital information infrastructures that provide “information spaces” for voyages of scientific discovery. The case for alternative policy approaches is argued in this paper, and several specific proposals are set out for further discussion.",2584665884,Paul A. David

The aim of this study is to investigate academics' attitudes towards and practice of open access (OA) publishing. The results are based on a survey study of academics at 12 Russell Group universities, and reflect responses from over 1800 researchers. This study found that whilst most academics support the principle of making knowledge freely available to everyone, the use of OA publishing among UK academics was still limited despite relevant established OA policies. The results suggest that there were differences in the extent of OA practice between different universities, academic disciplines, age and seniorities. Academics' use in OA publishing was also related to their awareness of OA policy and OA repositories, their attitudes towards the importance of OA publishing and their belief in OA citation advantage. The implications of these findings are relevant to the development of strategies for the implementation of OA policies.",2234327197,Yimei Zhu

This action shifted the patterns in using beyond than just a reference management tool and place a challenge in library science’s service on the reflection of new demographic pool’s patrons behavior and usage in using the library’s model. Librarians have to keep up on their toes, with these attributes in acquiring knowledge, tools, resources and operations to serve a unique information service model to their patrons, especially in academic and research libraries. Understanding the needs of the librarians, here at Swets, the partnership with Mendeley aims to set a milestone ahead to aid and provide a strategic alignment model for their on-progress challenging model. Together, in this paper, the illustration will focus on the discussion topic to invest and align strategically, a tool that is designed to be part of the ecological cycle in current scholarly communication lifestyle. Mendeley is not only build for a basic reference management tools to aid academics and researchers (or even undergraduate) in their daily academic writing. But, that will be beyond than just a scholar’s imagination. This includes topics as access, visible, preserve, collaborate, share, knowledge transfer, mobile and openness. This is because Mendeley rides on the open science concept, indirectly immerse the usage of the product in part of a scholar’s life in a university. This will seeds a good, positive seeding investment for librarians and research managers to look beyond the basic service model, along with the other productive competitive services and platforms, especially for Malaysia’s and South East Asia’s library and information science industry to leverage for the future in open science development.",2169674066; 2352052852; 2401232894; 2401016744; 2786440801,Nurhazman Abdul Aziz; Keita Bando; Wan Ahmad; Hanis Bin; Wan Yahya

We present an example of how free and open source software can be incorporated into geospatial education to promote open and reproducible science. Since 2008 graduate students at North Carolina State University have the opportunity to take a course on geospatial modeling and analysis that is taught with both proprietary and free and open source software. In this course, students perform geospatial tasks simultaneously in the proprietary package ArcGIS and the free and open source package GRASS GIS. By ensuring that students learn to distinguish between geospatial concepts and software specifics, students become more flexible and stronger spatial thinkers when choosing solutions for their independent work in the future. We also discuss ways to continually update and improve our publicly available teaching materials for reuse by teachers, self-learners and other members of the GIS community. Only when free and open source software is fully integrated into geospatial education, we will be able to encourage a culture of openness and, thus, enable greater reproducibility in research and development applications.",2127902137; 2152441655; 2343409624; 33634117; 199075560,Vaclav Petras; Anna Petrasova; Brendan Harmon; Ross K.

In this role, it relies on sophisticated dynamic data movement facilities developed in ATLAS. In certain scenarios, such as small research teams in ATLAS Tier-3 sites and non-ATLAS Virtual Organizations, the overhead of installation and operation of these components makes their use not very cost effective. Globus Online is an emerging new tool from the Globus Alliance, which already proved popular within the research community. It provides the users with fast and robust file transfer capabilities that can also be managed from a Web interface, and in addition to grid sites, can have individual workstations and laptops serving as data transmission endpoints.

To enable this computational infrastructure, we configured, for the first time, a LIGO Data Grid Tier-1 Center that can submit heterogeneous LIGO workflows using Open Science Grid facilities. In order to enable a seamless connection between the LIGO Data Grid and Blue Waters via Open Science Grid, we utilize Shifter to containerize LIGO&#x2019;s workflow software. This work represents the first time Open Science Grid, Shifter, and Blue Waters are unified to tackle a scientific problem and, in particular, it is the first time a framework of this nature is used in the context of large scale gravitational wave data analysis. This new framework has been used in the last several weeks of LIGO&#x2019;s second discovery campaign to run the most computationally demanding gravitational wave search workflows on Blue Waters, and accelerate discovery in the emergent field of gravitational wave astrophysics.

This is further complicated by the increasing integration of open science data from other disciplines to analyze complex systems, like climate change, animal migration, and sea/air interaction. This shift has been unplanned, chaotic, and emergent, and has placed the onus on researchers to stay current with best practices for managing, analyzing, and sharing data. Ocean scientists who do not have the technical skill to manage this data are turning to technologists, on the assumption they have the expertise required to help. To test this assumption, we examined an experiential learning program that placed technologists at ocean data centres in Canada, conducting interviews with students and employers to identify the competencies they believed were required to manage ocean data, which were missing in students' education up to that point, and which students gained during the work term placement.",2508588757; 2783627422; 2778508694,Lee Wilson; Adrienne Colborne; Michael Smit

Recent surveys on the activities of these TTOs show that although European public-funded research lags behind the United States in patent applications and grants, they produce more start-ups, and have comparable results for the number of licenses executed. Steps to improve the international comparability of TTO surveys could provide useful new indicators for policy development.

The goal of this paper is to identify the most pressing obstacles (in terms of funding, technology, Intellectual Property Rights, contracts, data protection, and social norms), which are hindering the development of Open Science and Open Research Data, with particular attention to the situation of developing countries. The innovative aim of this paper, which is the first essay of a broader research, is to prepare the epistemological basis for a Law and Technology theory of “Open Bioinformation” (OB), where bioinformation stands for research data in life sciences. We argue that so far the literature has addressed the promotion of openness in science and research data only in a sectorial manner, taking into account just one or a few of the factors affecting openness as if they were not related or mutually influenced. Therefore, the suggested solutions are limited to a single perspective and fail to consider the dynamics of information control. In our view, a holistic approach, that tries to zoom out from the specific disciplines and take into account the whole picture, would contribute to determining an effective policy for promoting OB. For this reason, we have to consider the technological, legal, and sociological aspects, in order to assess whether and how changes in one domain might affect the others. ",2111890350; 1998237228,Roberto Caso; Rossana Ducato

Fundamental re-thinks of how biological and medical research are prioritized and funded are urgently needed, but sadly appear to be unlikely unless the research and advocacy communities push harder and in a more unified manner. Early in the Obama presidency and the NIH Directorship of Dr Francis Collins, the FASEB Office of Public Affairs performed an analysis of trends in funding of R01 and other Research Project Grants and shared that with the Director and his office. Using the FASEB analysis, whose numbers drew on NIH data, an independent commentary (below) was submitted to (but not published in) Science. With the analysis a few years old, this older viewpoint is followed by updates that touch on how the trends have fared since early 2010 and comment on other aspects of the ongoing cull in biomedical research. In particular, data on some of the growth areas that continue to prosper at the expense of the ever-declining direct support for R01 science are discussed.",2025584739,Mark Boothby

The major focus of the FIFE project is the development, deployment, and integration of solutions for high throughput computing, data management, database access and collaboration management within an experiment. To accomplish this goal, FIFE has developed workflows that utilize Open Science Grid compute sites along with dedicated and commercial cloud resources. The FIFE project has made significant progress integrating into experiment computing operations several services including a common job submission service, software and reference data distribution through CVMFS repositories, flexible and robust data transfer clients, and access to opportunistic resources on the Open Science Grid. The progress with current experiments and plans for expansion with additional projects will be discussed.

Detailed studies of single species can identify fitness benefits of specific traits and why those traits evolved, but these results might be rather species specific. Thus, to reach general conclusions about which ecological factors favour the evolution of a specific trait, comparative studies in several taxa are needed. Currently, comparative studies arising from databases summarizing many field studies are flourishing and provide important insights for our understanding of social evolution [1–3]. Large, diverse datasets require detailed specialist knowledge in a wide variety of systems or taxa that is very rare, making it difficult to assess the quality of such databases. Referees of papers submitted to assess these comparative studies should review the part of the database for which they do have specialized knowledge. In some cases, studies with large databases could benefit from one additional referee that focuses only on the database itself, just as the views of specialized referees are often sought on aspects of statistical analysis or of animal ethics. In sum, the quality of a study depends on the quality of the data, and this is also the case for comparative studies.

A recently published comparative study in Royal Society Open Science about cooperative breeding in mammals [4] used a database previously used in a comparative study of the evolution of monogamy in the same taxa [5]. It had already been shown that for the third largest mammalian order, the Eulipotyphla, the information in this database is, to a large extent, inadequate [6]. In the supplement to their earlier publication on the evolution of social monogamy [5], Lukas & Clutton-Brock state that the database is the result of a systemic literature review on ‘mammalian species…collecting …",2200539434,Carsten Schradin

Without these services users of the OSG would not be able to run jobs, locate resources, obtain information about the status of systems or generally use the OSG. For this reason these services must be highly available. This paper describes the automated monitoring and notification systems used to diagnose and report problems. Described here are the means used by OSG Operations to monitor systems such as physical facilities, network operations, server health, service availability and software error events. Once detected, an error condition generates a message sent to, for example, Email, SMS, Twitter, an Instant Message Server, etc. The mechanism being developed to integrate these monitoring systems into a prioritized and configurable alarming system is emphasized.",2511198834; 2513718816; 2509375029,S Hayashi; S Teige and; R Quick

These fixed-scale datasets are commonly downloaded to the researcher’s computer where the analysis is performed. The data can be shared, archived, and cited with well-established technologies, such as the Dataverse Project, to support the published results. The trend toward big data—including large-scale streaming data—is starting to transform research and has the potential to impact policymaking as well as our understanding of the social, economic, and political problems that affect human societies. However, big data research poses new challenges to the execution of the analysis, archiving and reuse of the data, and reproduction of the results. Downloading these datasets to a researcher’s computer is impractical, leading to analyses taking place in the cloud, and requiring unusual expertise, collaboration, and tool development.

Large molecular data sets, often referred to as “big data,” are increasingly incorporated into digital databases, many of which are freely accessible online. These data have come to be seen as resources that play a key role in mediating global market exchange, thus achieving a prominent social and economic status well beyond science itself. At the same time, calls to make all such data publicly and freely available have garnered strength and visibility, most prominently in the form of the Open Data movement. I discuss these developments by considering the conditions under which data journey across the communities and institutions implicated in globalized biology and biomedicine, and what this indicates about how Internet-based communication and the use of online databases affect scientific research and its role within contemporary society.",2277750656,Sabina Leonelli

The purpose of this study was to analyze the UITT process and its outcomes. Based on 98 structured interviews of key UITT stakeholders (i.e., university administrators, academic and industry scientists, business managers, and entrepreneurs) at five research universities in two regions of the US, we conclude that these stakeholders have different perspectives on the desired outputs of UITT. More importantly, numerous barriers to effective UITT were identified, including culture clashes, bureaucratic inflexibility, poorly designed reward systems, and ineffective management of university technology transfer offices (TTOs). Based on this qualitative evidence, we provide numerous recommendations for improving the UITT process.",2176089339; 2009983899; 381074035; 2150264946,Donald S. Siegel; David A. Waldman; Leanne E.

Nonetheless, despite being one of the most developed countries in Latin America, Chile imports most of the knowledge and technology necessary to drive innovation in the country. The tight budget that the Chilean government assigned to research and development and the absence of a long-term scientific agenda contributed to a limited supply of scientists over the years. In an effort to reverse this scenario, Chile has created several fellowships, such as the Becas Chile Program (BCP) to encourage new generations to pursue graduate studies to ultimately advance research and development in situ. More than 6000 fellows are now being trained abroad, accumulating an incredible potential to transform the Chilean scientific environment as we know it.  Chile now faces a greater challenge: it has to offer infrastructure and job openings to the highly skilled professionals in whom it invested. Unfortunately no clear public policies to address this situation have been developed, partially due to the lack of a dedicated institution, such as a Ministry for Science and Technology which could focalize the necessary efforts to promote such policies. Therefore, in the meantime, Chilean scientist have been motivated to create different organizations, such as, Mas Ciencia para Chile and Nexos Chile-USA, to promote constructive discussion of the policies that could be implemented to improve the Chilean scientific situation. We hope that these and other organizations have a real impact on the generation of scientific guidelines that will finally contribute to the development of the country.",2581857085; 2233874302,Alexia Nunez-Parra; Maria-Paz Ramos

A few general properties of social networks within both realms are discussed, as they emerge from the new economics of science and recent applied work on “small worlds”. A new data-set on patent inventors is explored, in order to show that social networks within Proprietary Technology are much more fragmented than Open Science ones, except for science-based technologies. Two propositions are then put forward on the “open” behaviour expected from academic inventors , namely university scientists getting involved in Proprietary Technology networks by signing patents. Both propositions are confirmed by data, which show academic inventors to be more central and better connected than non-academic ones. The database and methodology produced for this paper are suggested to be relevant for the more general debate on the role of geographical and cognitive distance in university–industry technology transfer.",2255939663; 205378489; 2288727862,Margherita Balconi; Stefano Breschi; Francesco Lissoni

At first glance, these may seem quite unrelated – the former relates to ongoing concerns that many academic research findings may be incorrect [1], while the latter reflects the movement to encourage openness in science, through open access publication, open data archiving, and so on [2]. My argument is that the open science practices could in fact serve to improve the reproducibility of published work. Why do I think this?

It has been suggested that the incentive structures within which scientists operate may not promote behavior that maximizes the value of scientific research. Novel, groundbreaking results are more likely to be published in high-profile journals, and publication in these journals is more likely to lead to career advancement [3]. This may lead scientists to focus their resources on exploratory work, at the expense of confirmatory work. Researchers may also divide their resources into multiple projects, in the hope that this will increase the chances of one generating a novel result. This will mean that many studies may be underpowered, increasing the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive [4]. Researchers may also exploit analytical flexibility to obtain a statistically significant finding (a process known as ‘p-hacking’), and then present these results as if they were anticipated a priori (also known as HARKing – Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). When results are perceived to be unexciting (i.e., null), researchers may be less inclined to devote time and effort to writing these up for publication [5], leading to widespread publication bias. The focus on positive results may also be reflected in citation biases, whereby those null results that are published received proportionately fewer citations than positive results on the same topic [6]. The consequence of this is a literature that is heavily skewed towards discovery rather than replication, and looks very unlike the totality of the activity that generated it.

There is clearly concern that these issues are undermining the value of science – in the UK the Academy of Medical Sciences recently convened a meeting, jointly with a number of other funders, to explore these issues, while in the US the National Institutes of Health has an ongoing initiative to improve research reproducibility [7]. How can these issues be addressed? There is scope for change at both the level of the wider incentive structures within which scientists operate, and at the level of the day-to-day activity of individual researchers and research groups. Funders and journals, for example, can mandate change – when the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute required the pre-registration of primary outcomes in clinical trials that they funded, the proportion of studies reporting a benefit of the intervention over the comparator declined dramatically, relative to studies published before this requirement [8]. A number of exciting initiatives are emerging. For example, several journals now offer a Registered Reports format [9], whereby acceptance in principle is offered on the basis of a detailed study protocol, prior to any data collection taking place, on the basis that the results of a well-designed study should always be informative and valuable. In principle, funders and journals could work together, offering acceptance in principle together with funding to conduct the research.

What can individual researchers and groups do? My group, the Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, part of the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol and the UK Centre for Tobacco Studies, has been gradually moving towards an open science model over the past few years. We now routinely pre-register studies that involved collection of new data on the Open Science Framework, and share the resulting data via the University of Bristol Research Data Repository (other non-institutional repositories also exist, such as the Open Science Framework and Mendeley Data). This has been a gradual process that has entailed updating a number of our internal procedures [2]. Moreover, it is an ongoing process – we are currently exploring sharing our study materials via platforms such as the Open Science Framework, and posting preprints of our work ahead of publication (for example on bioRxiv). Other enhancements to these processes are possible – for example, the use of research resource identifiers in subsequent publications should allow other researchers to identify exactly the materials used. In our opinion the benefits outweigh this modest effort. Not only is transparency and openness a valuable end in itself (particularly when research is publicly-funded), but it also serves as a quality control process. When researchers know that their study protocol or their data will be available for public scrutiny, they will be inclined to triple-check where previously they would have double-checked. Science is a human endeavour, and honest error is inevitable (witness typographical errors in published manuscripts, despite multiple rounds of peer review, proof reading, and so on). We need to embed processes in our work that help catch these errors, and foster an open culture whereby self-reporting of errors is encouraged.",2303040408,Marcus R. Munafò

The neuroscience community significantly benefits from the proliferation of imaging-related analysis software packages. Established packages such as SPM (Ashburner, 2012), the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Jenkinson et al., 2012), Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012), Slicer (Fedorov et al., 2012), and the AFNI toolkit (Cox, 2012) aid neuroimaging researchers around the world in performing complex analyses as part of ongoing neuroscience research. In conjunction with distributing robust software tools, neuroimaging packages also continue to incorporate algorithmic innovation for improvement in analysis tools.

As fellow scientists who actively participate in neuroscience research through our contributions to the Insight Toolkit1 (e.g., Johnson et al., 2007; Ibanez et al., 2009; Tustison and Avants, 2012) and other packages such as MindBoggle,2 Nipype3 (Gorgolewski et al., 2011), and the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs),4 (Avants et al., 2010, 2011) we notice an increasing number of publications that intend a fair comparison of algorithms which, in principle, is a good thing. Our concern is the lack of detail with which these comparisons are often presented and the corresponding possibility of instrumentation bias (Sackett, 1979) where “defects in the calibration or maintenance of measurement instruments may lead to systematic deviations from true values” (considering software as a type of instrument requiring proper “calibration” and “maintenance” for accurate measurements). Based on our experience (including our own mistakes), we propose a preliminary set of guidelines that seek to minimize such bias with the understanding that the discussion will require a more comprehensive response from the larger neuroscience community. Our intent is to raise awareness in both authors and reviewers to issues that arise when comparing quantitative algorithms. Although herein we focus largely on image registration, these recommendations are relevant for other application areas in biologically-focused computational image analysis, and for reproducible computational science in general. This commentary complements recent papers that highlight statistical bias (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009; Vul and Pashler, 2012), bias induced by registration metrics (Tustison et al., 2012), and registration strategy (Yushkevich et al., 2010) and guideline papers for software development (Prlic and Procter, 2012).",841962150; 2264103995; 2020597814; 2096987888; 2158872974; 2554974777; 475755,Nicholas J.

To provide an innovative framework for the use of Open Data as Open Educational Resources for developing scientific and citizenship skills.

In a global and multicultural society, people need understand the political processes, the socio-economical climate, to be able to relate with the problems of the society, to be capable to critically understand and information and assess the media.

In our societies, the educational systems need to develop critical thinking skills to educate active citizens to engage and participate democratic discussions, in a tolerant, respectful, creative and knowledgeable manner by learning to construct knowledge by critically analysing information from various sources and formats, including data.

Even if Open Data, defined by Open Knowledge International (2013)[1] as “data that can be freely used, re-used and redistributed by anyone – subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and sharealike” it is not traditionally considered as Open Educational Resources (OER), we believe that being capable of analysing and interpreting data is increasingly important and can be understood as key to the development of transversal skills, which are defined by UNESCO (2015)[2] as “critical and innovative thinking, inter-personal skills; intra-personal skills, and global citizenship”(p.4).

If one of our goals as educators is to develop these transversal skills in students, towards enabling them to function as citizens, to actively participate in the discourse and debates of society, to think critically, to be tolerant, to understand diversity, understand migratory flows, to support equality and to respect and promote human rights, then we propose that Open Data can be a key enabler to achieve this targets in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals [3] to ensure inclusive and quality education for all and promote lifelong learning (G4); Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls (G5); Reduce inequality within and among countries (G10); Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts (G13) and Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies (G16).

Open Data is produced and used at various levels in research, governance, policymaking and civil society. In educational and academic contexts, Open Data can be used as an Open Educational Resource (OER) to help support the engagement of students and researchers in analysing and collaborating towards finding solutions for contemporary real-world problems, chiefly by embedding Open Data and Open Science principles in research-based, scenario-led activities. In this way, students can experience working with the same raw materials scientists and policy-makers use, but also, learn effective fact-checking abilities to critically interact with the media to promote inclusion, social justice, human rights and equality.

This diffusion of ideas operates not through published journal articles but rather through informal communications between researchers. In recent years, researchers have availed themselves of collaborative Web 2.0 forums such as blogs, wikis, and social networking sites to meet their need for increasingly sophisticated vehicles of informal communication. Examinations of the database Faculty of 1000 and the semantic web application VIVO help to illustrate how invisible colleges have migrated to a networked environment where they can play an even stronger role within scholarly communications. This paper will argue that the enhanced social diffusion enabled by such collaborative online venues offers an opportunity for researchers globally to accelerate the pace of innovation in an increasingly open era of team science.",2074334329,John Carey

We review the policy background to open science, and literature on the benefits attributed to open data, considering how these relate to curation and to questions of who participates in science. The case studies investigate the perceived benefits to researchers, research institutions and funding bodies of utilising open scientific methods, the disincentives and barriers, and the degree to which there is evidence to support these perceptions. Six case study groups were selected in astronomy, bioinformatics, chemistry, epidemiology, language technology and neuroimaging. The studies identify relevant examples and issues through qualitative analysis of interview transcripts. We provide a typology of degrees of open working across the research lifecycle, and conclude that better support for open working, through guidelines to assist research groups in identifying the value and costs of working more openly, and further research to assess the risks, incentives and shifts in responsibility entailed by opening up the research process are needed.",2098200951; 2140345425,Angus Whyte; Graham Pryor

The involvement of society in the process has been proposed as an approach to increasing trust and engagement by making better use of available data and knowledge. In this session, EFSA explored the challenges in building trust and engagement and the latest thinking and methodologies for increasing openness that can help the organisation to move beyond traditional dialogue and towards a more sustainable stakeholder and society interaction. The discussion centred on the needs of EFSA and of target audiences throughout the process, from risk assessment initiation through societal decision-making and communication. The main focus of the session was on methodologies and approaches that would enable EFSA to increase its scientific rigour and build trust from additional inputs gained by opening up its risk assessments at the level of data gathering, data analysis, expertise and innovation. This will require an approach that moves beyond traditional risk assessment practices that rely on a long chain of static information and knowledge such as scientific articles, reviews, expert groups and committees.",2228344541; 2470363716; 2224099371,Didier Verloo; Tom Meyvis; Anthony Smith

In the recent years a clear long-standing trend in the OECD area have emerged, which is reflected in the expansion of knowledge-related investments and activities, thus transforming the industrial economies into knowledge-based economies. This paper, which is sympathetic with a Schumpeterian view that looks at the modern economic growth as a knowledge-driven process, shows that long run growth is a complex process that cannot be explained by one factor alone. Whereas in the Schumpeterian economy technological progress is the driver of economic growth, so goods are produced under conditions of substantial increasing returns to scale, and innovation becomes the principle source of wealth, in this work the former view is enriched with the idea that institutions have an important role to play in the creation and diffusion of new knowledge and in the process of growth, even if it is difficult to establish ex ante the nature of these relations. The topics of the paper concern scientific and technological knowledge and its relationship with human capital, the issue of open science and the necessary setting of appropriate institutions for knowledge creation. Moreover, an examination of OECD data related to investment in knowledge in OECD countries, with particular attention to human capital, is carried out to evaluate their economic performances. In such a context, the need of a long term growth policy for the EU economies consistent with the Lisbon Agenda is set forth; therefore the paper tries to suggest some proposals for a long term growth policy of the EU economies in this direction. Finally, conclusions end up the paper.",226102527,Daniele Schilirò

We assess both the magnitude and consequences of these developments, first describing the primary tools of IP and the changing nature of their influence on science, and then examining the effects of IP on the roles, rules, and relations of the scientific enterprise. We also consider the emergence of new models of scientific practice that blend both public and private. We debate whether current changes represent a transition or transformation in the relations between science and property. Finally, we argue that just as the public and private spheres of science may be converging, so must future scholarship if we are to answer harder questions about the appropriate balance between traditional logics of open science and the more recent regimes of proprietary science.",2277739274; 2145473309,Diana R.

Indeed, given these physical sources, it is then also possible to create further virtual sources that integrate, aggregate or summarise the data from the original sources. As a result, there is a plethora of data sources, from which a small subset may be able to provide the information required to support a task. The number and rate of change in the available sources is likely to make manual source selection and curation by experts impractical for many applications, leading to the need to pursue a pay-as-you-go approach, in which crowds or data consumers annotate results based on their correctness or suitability, with the resulting annotations used to inform, e.g., source selection algorithms. However, for pay-as-you-go feedback collection to be cost-effective, it may be necessary to select judiciously the data items on which feedback is to be obtained. This paper describes OLBP (Ordering and Labelling By Precision), a heuristics-based approach to the targeting of data items for feedback to support mapping and source selection tasks, where users express their preferences in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall. The proposed approach is then evaluated on two different scenarios, mapping selection with synthetic data, and source selection with real data produced by web data extraction. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the amount of feedback required to reach user-provided objectives when using OLBP.",2490164041; 2070167002; 2779149827; 542769824,Julio César Cortés Ríos; Norman W.

Tools available today were constructed with layers of technology developed over decades. Here, we explain how some of the principles used to develop this technology are sub-optimal for the construction of data analysis tools for biologists. In contrast, we applied language workbench technology (LWT) to create a data analysis language, called MetaR, tailored for biologists with no programming experience, as well as expert bioinformaticians and statisticians. A key novelty of this approach is its ability to blend user interface with scripting in such a way that beginners and experts alike can analyze data productively in the same analysis platform. While presenting MetaR, we explain how a judicious use of LWT eliminates problems that have historically contributed to data analysis bottlenecks. These results show that language design with LWT can be a compelling approach for developing intelligent data analysis tools.",1985779943; 2511454610; 2239350854; 1976808109,Fabien Campagne; Alexander Pann; William Digan; Manuele Simi

Lexical analysis of open-ended survey questions revealed that students most highly value working with plants and scientists.  By examining student responses to this cognitive apprenticeship model, we provide new perspectives on the importance of the personal relationships students form with scientists and plants when working as members of a research community.

We claim that this paradigm, which insists on the distributive nature of innovation among a wide range of heterogeneous actors, does not put enough emphasis on the condition of access to knowledge. Yet, the open dimension of knowledge is a very important feature to sustain a collective mode of innovation. We propose therefore a stronger definition of open innovation, which is based on three constitutive characteristics: (i) Firms voluntarily release knowledge; (ii) Knowledge is open, i.e. is available to all interested parties without discrimination; (iii) dynamic interactions take place among the stakeholders to enrich the open knowledge base. Examples that fit our definition of open innovation are open science, user centered innovation (von Hippel, 2005), free-libre open source software, collective invention (Allen, 1983), etc. We conclude with a discussion on the role of IPR to secure open innovation.",2491748022,Julien Pénin

During the construction and operation of this CI, we encountered many unforeseen challenges and benefits unique to an actively used infrastructure of this size. The most significant problems were integrating Condor with existing campus UPC resources, managing resource and user growth, coping with the distributed ownership of compute resources around campus, and integrating this CI with the Tera- Gridand Open Science Grid.

One major finding of the paper is that after controlling for founder prior work experience and other organizational and environmental factors, biotechnology firms with proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs on the founding team have higher probability to adopt open science. A second note-worthy finding is that founder professional education background can mitigate the constraint of organizational environment on strategy. While a crowded technological niche provides a more challenging environment for firms to implement open science due to higher scooping risks, the deterring effect of such a high-risk environment is smaller among firms founded by proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs. I also found that the link between entrepreneurial professional education background and open science is stronger in a less favorable institutional environment for open science. The finding is consistent with and complements the growing body of work emphasizing the importance of entrepreneurial background in developing knowledge about new venture strategy and structure. It suggests that demographic changes in educational background of entrepreneurs in an organizational field may bring exogenous shocks to and shift the strategic trend in an organizational field. The implications for management innovations in an organizational field are discussed.",2112773307,Waverly W. Ding

There is an emerging consensus among the members of the academic research community that the practices of this new science paradigm should be congruent with “open science”. This entails that the bonanza of research data, the wide availability of algorithms, data tools, and data services produced by the members of the research community must be discoverable, understandable, and usable by overcoming all kinds of heterogeneity and logical inconsistencies. The main concept for coping with the many dimensions of heterogeneity and logical inconsistency is mediation. Mediation is achieved by mediators or brokers. These are software modules that exploit encoded knowledge about certain datasets, data services, and user needs in order to implement an intermediary service. A mediating environment is an environment that provides a core set of intermediary services. Mediation should be a distinct functionality of future research data infrastructures. This paper surveys the different levels of interoperability, i.e., exchangeability, compatibility, and usability, their properties and relationships, mediation concepts, functions, and intermediary services. The current interoperability landscape is also illustrated. Finally, the paper advocates the need for mediating environments to be supported by future research data infrastructures and envisions that one of the most important features of future research data infrastructures will be mediation software.",2635206768,Costantino Thanos

Increasingly, these dynamics have been marked by changes in scientific communication. Researchers’ attitudes toward open science, alternative models of publication and toward originality are among the elements shaping the current scientific landscape. This changing panorama reflects on the attitude of authors, editors and publishers toward the correction of the literature, a practice that is encountered to different extents in different fields. This practice may suggest, among several issues, commitment of the scientific community to boosting the reliability of the research record. Would the research output of countries have any association with this panorama? We analyzed 1623 retractions issued in 2013–2015 and discussed in Retraction Watch (RW), www.retractionwatch.com. These retractions account for a considerable fraction of the total of retraction notices in PubMed in the same period. They were categorized by reason, field and country (that of the corresponding author). These retractions were distributed among 71 countries, with 15 countries accounting for a major share (85%)—most of those with the largest number of publications in the Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR). However, there is no consistent pattern for the relationship between ranking in SJR and ranking in number of retractions across countries in our RW dataset, which is skewed mostly by the fact that the RW website tends to post newsworthy retractions, with a bias toward biomedical and clinical sciences. This caveat notwithstanding, the prevalence of the most productive countries in our dataset of retractions is worth noting. Gradually, retractions have been permeating the dynamics of research productivity in many countries but, so far, there is limited knowledge of this interaction. We believe it should be further explored.",2782219202; 2129294431,M. D. Ribeiro; Sonia M. R. Vasconcelos

However, current reporting practices for research resources are insufficient to allow humans and algorithms to identify the exact resources that are reported or answer basic questions such as “What other studies used resource X?” To address this issue, the Resource Identification Initiative was launched as a pilot project to improve the reporting standards for research resources in the methods sections of papers and thereby improve identifiability and reproducibility. The pilot engaged over 25 biomedical journal editors from most major publishers, as well as scientists and funding officials. Authors were asked to include Research Resource Identifiers (RRIDs) in their manuscripts prior to publication for three resource types: antibodies, model organisms, and tools (including software and databases). RRIDs represent accession numbers assigned by an authoritative database, e.g., the model organism databases, for each type of resource. To make it easier for authors to obtain RRIDs, resources were aggregated from the appropriate databases and their RRIDs made available in a central web portal ( www.scicrunch.org/resources). RRIDs meet three key criteria: they are machine readable, free to generate and access, and are consistent across publishers and journals. The pilot was launched in February of 2014 and over 300 papers have appeared that report RRIDs. The number of journals participating has expanded from the original 25 to more than 40. Here, we present an overview of the pilot project and its outcomes to date. We show that authors are generally accurate in performing the task of identifying resources and supportive of the goals of the project. We also show that identifiability of the resources pre- and post-pilot showed a dramatic improvement for all three resource types, suggesting that the project has had a significant impact on reproducibility relating to research resources.",292411664; 2140193530; 2101256842; 2156469902; 2016906876; 1999716689; 1988349659; 519503380; 2165961942; 2601343214; 2221279278; 665904529; 2663844825,Anita Bandrowski; Serena Tan; Nicole L.

Some accomplishments of these initiatives are noted, but this article focuses on why they do not provide a general solution for what ails psychology. There are inherent limitations to mass replications ever being conducted in many areas of psychology, both in terms of their practicality and their prospects for improving the science. Unnecessary compromises were built into the ground rules for design and publication of the Open Science Collaboration: Psychology that undermine its effectiveness. Some ground rules could actually be flipped into guidance for how not to conduct replications. Greater adherence to best publication practices, transparency in the design and publishing of research, strengthening of independent post-publication peer review and firmer enforcement of rules about data sharing and declarations of conflict of interest would make many replications unnecessary. Yet, it has been difficult to move beyond simple endorsement of these measures to consistent implementation. Given the strong institutional support for questionable publication practices, progress will depend on effective individual and collective use of social media to expose lapses and demand reform.

This action shifted the patterns in using beyond than just a reference management tool and place a challenge in library science’s service on the reflection of new demographic pool’s patrons behavior and usage in using the library’s model. Librarians have to keep up on their toes, with these attributes in acquiring knowledge, tools, resources and operations to serve a unique information service model to their patrons, especially in academic and research libraries. Understanding the needs of the librarians, here at Swets, the partnership with Mendeley aims to set a milestone ahead to aid and provide a strategic alignment model for their on-progress challenging model. Together, in this paper, the illustration will focus on the discussion topic to invest and align strategically, a tool that is designed to be part of the ecological cycle in current scholarly communication lifestyle. Mendeley is not only build for a basic reference management tools to aid academics and researchers (or even undergraduate) in their daily academic writing. But, that will be beyond than just a scholar’s imagination. This includes topics as access, visible, preserve, collaborate, share, knowledge transfer, mobile and openness. This is because Mendeley rides on the open science concept, indirectly immerse the usage of the product in part of a scholar’s life in a university. This will seeds a good, positive seeding investment for librarians and research managers to look beyond the basic service model, along with the other productive competitive services and platforms, especially for Malaysia’s and South East Asia’s library and information science industry to leverage for the future in open science development.",2169674066; 2352052852; 2578296929,Nurhazman Abdul Aziz; Keita Bando; Wan Ahmad Hanis Wan Yahya

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Findings: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.",2149895133,Karthik Ram

It is the single largest integrated neuroscience database world-wide. Anybody can freely access this data without any restrictions.

We are embarked on an ambitious 10-year initiative to understand the structure and function of the neocortex and associated satellite structures in humans and mice. We are setting up high through-put pipelines to exhaustively characterize the morphology, electrophysiology and transcriptome of cell types as well as their synaptic interconnections in the human neocortex (via a combination of fetal, neurosurgical and post-mortem tissues & human stem cells differentiated into forebrain neurons) and in the laboratory mouse. We are building brain observatories to image the activities of neurons throughout the cortico-thalamic system in behaving mice, to record their electrical activities, and to analyze their connectivity at the ultra-structural level. We are constructing biophysically detailed as well as simplified computer simulations of these networks and of their information processing capabilities.

We present a theoretical framework that outlines when a firm’s involvement in academic communities enhances its innovative performance in terms of new products in development. We argue that the disclosure of more, valuable R&D work in quality scholarly publications and collaborations with academic partners positively affect firm innovation. We further hypothesize a differential effect of adopting open science strategies on the innovation type, being more pronounced for radical innovations than for incremental innovations. We empirically analyze a unique panel dataset containing information on the product innovation performance and R&D activities of 160 UK therapeutic biotechnology firms over the period 1998- 2009. Our results from count data models on the number of new products in development provide empirical support for our hypotheses.",2320055183; 2056568000,Simcha Jong; Kremena Slavova

That editors are ‘gatekeepers’ (Crane 1967, Simon & Fyfe 1994), abetted by reviewers (de Grazia 1963, Hojat et al. 2003), has become a common motif in critiques of modern for-profit scientific publishing (Marusic 2010). The proposition is, roughly, that editors restrict access of meritorious science to journals of perceived higher value (Hojat et al. 2003) under the guise of providing content expertise (Powell 2010), while in fact of- ten erring in judgment (Smith 2006) and being motivated by the journal’s not authors’ interests 2 . Disappointing enough in its own right, when true, capricious (editorial) review takes on added sig- nificance as simple indices of publication rates and short-term impact grow in influence 3 . In an age of rapidly multiplying journals it seems increasingly possible to publish and perish. There are two broader threats too: that risky ‘high impact’ pa- pers are favored over thorough but less head- turning science, and conversely that innovations are filtered out prior to publication because they are kicking the shins, rather than standing on the shoulders, of giants. In the first case, science gains a reputation for being fundamentally flawed 2,4 . In the second case, incremental advances trap disci- plines within a detrimental cycle of confirmation bias (de Grazia 1963 in Crane 1967). Editors incar- nated as gatekeepers protect corrupt and crum- bling empires. Open Access (OA) journals such as PLoS ONE and PeerJ, that intend to review only “scientific and methodological soundness” and take editorial decisions without determining “‘impact’, ‘novelty’ or ‘interest’” 5 , are promoted as possible solutions. The perception that such review should increase the flow of data, for exam- ple by reducing under-reporting of negative re- sults (the ‘file drawer problem’ [Rosenthal 1979]), contributes to backing of these journals by advo- cates of Open Science and Big Data. Publication, in droves, by and for the masses, the logic goes, should democratize data, speed science, and en- hance knowledge. Carried to its logical end, PLoS Currents and rOpenSci for example, provide tools practically for self-publishing. In these models, the sorting of science occurs after, not before, publi- cation and is done through social media, com- menting, and citation. Laudable intentions not- withstanding, the intended objectivity may be un- attainable: review is susceptible to ‘unconscious bias’ (e.g., Englund et al. 1999, Moss-Racusin et al. 2012), social networks may coalesce around and amplify shared values (McPherson et al. 2001, Saez-Trumper et al. 2013), commenting is shaped by a subset of active network members 6 , and cita- tions are used selectively (Greenberg 2009). Amid the clamor of clashing publication models, few have asked “what are [academic jour- nals] for”? (Whittaker 2014:2). Simply, they should make science both more accessible and better (Whittaker 2014). Critics imply that tradi- tional for-profit non-OA publishers do neither. Does pay-to-publish OA necessarily do either? Re- moving financial barriers to reading scientific pa- pers is a ‘common good’ but alone is not synony- mous with greater access. Fees conceivably could prohibit some authors from publishing; others may publish so much that if the proverbial needle is in a haystack, it becomes harder to find among the burgeoning pile of chaff.

In response, Bristol-Myers Squibb and the Duke Clinical Research Institute have collaborated on a new initiative, Supporting Open Access to Researchers. The aim is to facilitate open sharing of Bristol-Myers Squibb trial data with interested researchers. Key features of the Supporting Open Access to Researchers data sharing model include an independent review committee that ensures expert consideration of each proposal, stringent data deidentification/anonymization and protection of patient privacy, requirement of prespecified statistical analysis plans, and independent review of manuscripts before submission for publication. We believe that these approaches will promote open science by allowing investigators to verify trial results as well as to pursue interesting secondary uses of trial data without compromising scientific integrity.",219617086; 2271207458; 2018874924; 2295778034; 2293344013; 2295760065; 2155727976,Michael J.

These interactions are predicted using the three-dimensional structure of the bound complex between each pair of protein and compound that is predicted by molecular docking. These docking runs consist of millions of individual short jobs each lasting only minutes. However, computing resources to execute these jobs (which cumulatively take tens of millions of CPU hours) are not readily or easily available in a cost effective manner. By looking to National Cyberinfrastructure resources, and specifically the Open Science Grid (OSG), we have been able to harness CPU power for researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine to provide a quick and efficient solution to their unmet computing needs. Using the job submission infrastructure provided by the OSG, the docking data and simulation executable was sent to more than 100 universities and research centers worldwide. These opportunistic resources provided millions of CPU hours in a matter of days, greatly reducing time docking simulation time for the research group. The overall impact of this approach allows researchers to identify small molecule candidates for individual proteins, or new protein targets for existing FDA-approved drugs and biologically active compounds.",2302944078; 66212441; 2140555764; 2297914240; 2044610785; 2142300158; 2308659011,Rob Quick; Samy O.

But as I focus on just one word to sum up the year, ""open"" rises to the top of the fist. For truly it was a year of all things open. My presidential theme is open data/open science and I am looking forward to hearing Tony Hey and Clifford Lynch speak at the LITA President's Program later this month on this topic. Dr. Lynch is also the recipient of this year's LITA/Library Hi Tech award for Outstanding Communication in Library and Information Technology, cosponsored by Emerald Group Publishing Limited. The prestigious Frederick G. Kilgour Award for Research in Library and Information Technology award, co-sponsored by OCLC, is being given to G. Sayeed Choudhury this year. Dr. Choudhury is a longtime proponent of open data and the award recognizes his leadership in the field of data curation through the National Science Foundation supported Data Conservancy project. As you well know ITAL is now an open-access journal. Open access continues to be a hot topic, and rightly so. My last column was devoted to the subject of open access, but, I do want to remind librarians to advocate for open access in the coming year--please keep up the fight! In addition to seeing our journal to its new platform, the Publications Committee has also been busy with a few new LITA Guides, one of which, ""Getting Started with GIS,"" by Eva Dodsworth, provides some guidance on harnessing data sets to work with geospatial technology. Ms. Dodworth will be conducting an online course on this topic in August and the Education Committee has many new courses in the pipeline. Internally LITA has been working towards a more open and transparent governance structure. The Board has been relentless in making sure that all of its meetings are open, from in-person meetings at conferences to our monthly phone meetings to conversations on ALA Connect. We have been streaming our board meetings live and now will archive the recordings for a limited amount of time. This move has not been without challenges as board members and the LITA office struggled to build open communication with each other and the membership. Sometimes the challenges were ideological or legal, and sometimes the very technology that we embrace has caused problems, but I think it is safe to say that LITA leadership is working towards a common goal of a transparent structure with open communication channels. We opened up communication channels to get feedback on what our membership would like most when Zoe Stewart-Marshall, incoming president, hosted a town hall meeting at the ALA Midwinter Meeting that focused on member feedback. I know that she is working hard to address membership needs during her presidency. As a medical librarian I often travel in circles outside of ALA and when my medical colleagues learned that I was LITA President they were really impressed. LITA is a well-known and well-respected brand in the library community.

Modifiable ""Forkable Open-source programs"" on code sharing platforms make applications Apps utilizing data ready for reuse. In order to organize a web-based scientific competition, platforms for both semantic data resources and application programs need to be integrated so as to yield a creative cycle between data publication and application development. We developed the LinkData.org platform to integrate both data and application publishing platforms by recording dependency graphs, the utility of which we tested by organizing a scientific competition for synthetic biology on the platform. It was found that participants to the competition generated many dependency graphs by forking pre-existing applications or reusing schema of pre-existing datasets. These creative activities could not be observed explicitly without being recorded such as by dependency graphs among the datasets and applications on the platform. Hence we suggest a worldwide system needs to be established to record and harvest such dependency graphs from distributed data platforms and application-development platforms around the world, so that our intellectual and creative activities using open datasets for application development may be recorded properly.",2074724789; 2494264598; 2486712169; 2147271390,Sayoko Shimoyama; Robert Sidney Cox; David Gifford; Tetsuro Toyoda

Its workload is investigated here as a representative of the growing worldwide install base of petascale systems and also as a foreshadowing of science workloads to be expected for future systems. The study considers characteristics of the Jaguar workload such as resource utilization, typical job characteristics, most heavily used applications, application scaling and application usage patterns. Implications of these findings are considered for current petascale workflows and for exascale systems to be deployed later this decade.",2697751997; 2125104115,Wayne Joubert; Shi-Quan Su

The LHC user community has deep local support within the experiments. For other smaller communities and individual users the OSG provides consulting and technical services through the User Support area. We describe these sometimes successful and sometimes not so successful experiences and analyze lessons learned that are helping us improve our services. The services offered include forums to enable shared learning and mutual support, tutorials and documentation for new technology, and troubleshooting of problematic or systemic failure modes. For new communities and users, we bootstrap their use of the distributed high throughput computing technologies and resources available on the OSG by following a phased approach. We first adapt the application and run a small production campaign on a subset of ""friendly"" sites. Only then do we move the user to run full production campaigns across the many remote sites on the OSG, adding to the community resources up to hundreds of thousands of CPU hours per day. This scaling up generates new challenges – like no determinism in the time to job completion, and diverse errors due to the heterogeneity of the configurations and environments – so some attention is needed to get good results. We cover recent experiences with image simulation for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), small-file large volume data movement for the Dark Energy Survey (DES), civil engineering simulation with the Network for Earthquake Engineering Simulation (NEES), and accelerator modeling with the Electron Ion Collider group at BNL. We will categorize and analyze the use cases and describe how our processes are evolving based on lessons learned.",25894833; 2091181715; 2776923209; 2125772623; 739127621,Gabriele Garzoglio; Tanya Levshina; Mats Rynge; Chander Sehgal; Marko Slyz

The nonconformity of released data for digital processing also requires vast and costly data input and adaptation. Archaeology should face the cognitive challenges posed by digital environments, changing in scope and rhythm. We advocate the adoption of a synergy between recording techniques, field analytics, and a collaborative approach to create a new epistemological perspective, one in which research questions are constantly redefined through real-time, collaborative analysis of data as they are collected and/or searched for in an excavation. Since new questions are defined in science discourse after previous results have been disseminated and discussed within the scientific community, sharing evidence in remote with colleagues, both in the process of field collection and subsequent study, will be a key innovative feature, allowing a complex and real-time distant interaction with the scholarly community and leading to more rapid improvements in research agendas and queries.",2768981006; 2026636441; 2579798095; 2769797953; 2667566098; 2050975364; 2062472966; 2056571667,Nicolò Marchetti; Ivana Angelini; Gilberto Artioli; Giacomo Benati; Gabriele Bitelli; Antonio Curci; Gustavo Marfia; Marco Roccetti

However, the success of the OSS mindshare and collaborative online experience has wider implications to many other fields of human endeavor than the mere licensing of computer programmes. There are a growing number of institutions interested in using OSS licensing schemes to distribute creative works and scientific research, and even to publish online journals through open access (“OA”) licenses. There appears to be growing concern in the scientific community about the trend to fence and protect scientific research through intellectual property, particularly by the abuse of patent applications for biotechnology research. The OSS experience represents a successful model which demonstrates that IP licenses could eventually be used to protect against the misuse and misappropriation of basic scientific research. This would be 
done by translating existing OSS licenses to protect scientific research. Some efforts are already paying dividends in areas such as scientific publishing, evidenced by the growing number of OA journals. However, the process of translating software licenses to areas other than publishing has been more difficult. OSS and OA licenses work best with works subject to copyright protection because copyright subsists in an original work as soon as it is 
created. However, it has been more difficult to generate a license that covers patented works because patents are only awarded through a lengthy application and registration process. If the open science experiment is to work, it needs the intervention of the legal community to draft new licenses that may apply to scientific research. This article will look at the issue of such OA licenses, paying special care as to how the system can best be exported to scientific research based on OSS and OA ideals.",2731881632,Andrés Guadamuz González

The policy context is described and situated within the broader arena of open science. This is followed by commentary on transparency within the research process, which includes a brief overview of the related concept of reproducibility and the associated elements of research integrity, fraud and retractions. A two-dimensional model or continuum of open science is considered and the paper builds on this foundation by presenting a three-dimensional model, which includes the additional axis of ‘transparency’. The concept is further unpacked and preliminary definitions of key terms are introduced: transparency, transparency action, transparency agent and transparency tool.  An important linkage is made to the research lifecycle as a setting for potential transparency interventions by libraries. Four areas are highlighted as foci for enhanced engagement with transparency goals: Leadership and Policy, Advocacy and Training, Research Infrastructures and Workforce Development.",2194336525,Liz Lyon

However, the form that data sharing took in genomics was a result of specific technological practices. Biologists developed and adopted technologies of the nascent World Wide Web and Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) communities for sharing biological information. These technologies supported decentralized, collaborative, and nonproprietary modes of production in biology. Such technologies were appealing not merely because they were expedient for genomic work but because they also offered a way of promoting a particular form of genomic practice. As the genome sequencing centers scaled up their sharing efforts, a small group of computer-savvy biologists used these tools to promote the interests of the public genome sequencing effort. The agreements at Bermuda should be understood as part of this attempt to foster a particular form of genomic work.",2103657107,Hallam Stevens

It is important to understand the value collaborative projects, such as the OSG, contribute to the scientific community. This needs to be cognizant of the environment of commercial cloud offerings, the evolving and maturing middleware for grid based distributed computing, and the evolution in science and research dependence on computation. We present a first categorization of OSG value and analysis across several different aspects of the Consortium's goals and activities.

For success, these scientists will need to be able to monitor the execution status and application-level messages of their jobs that may run at any site within the Virtual Organization. In the Open Science Grid, the existing grid-wide tools provide abundant information about the whole system, but are geared towards Grid administrators, while information tailored towards individual users is not readily available except for the larger organizations that can afford to build their own tools. The User Centric Monitoring project addresses this gap by targeting a novel complete set of user-centric information including the status of a task of submitted jobs, queue positions, times of the start and finish, output and error messages, and reasons for failure.

Open access, it is suggested, can be interpreted as a push from within the academy to restore the communal role of publishing within science, and to establish new publishing arrangements that embed the core values of science. The paper concludes that while systemic change may be slow, open access scientific publishing cannot be dismissed as fad; the alignment between the core values of science and an approach to the dissemination of knowledge that is more communal, ensures the disruptive and restorative power of open access scientific publishing.",2488827564,Francois van Schalkwyk

open research, examining the sharing and reuse of research data, code, and open access publications, in
order to identify practical actions the Wellcome Trust can take to remove or mitigate barriers and maximise
the opportunities for practising open science.
More specifically, the study gathered evidence on:
· researchers’ views on various aspects of open research
· current practices in open access publishing
· views on future developments of publishing
· current practices and experiences in data sharing and reuse
· barriers to sharing and motivations for making data available
· current practices and experiences in code sharing and reuse
· barriers and motivations for code sharing
Evidence was gathered via an online survey with 583 respondents (25.6% of invited Wellcome Trust grant
holders) in July-August 2016, and focus group discussions with 22 participants in early September 2016.
Respondents formed an excellent representation of the different categories of grant holders.
Results were contrasted against results from a parallel survey with researchers funded by the Economic and
Social Research Council (ESRC), as a group of social science researchers who carry out research within the
context of a funder with a mandatory data sharing policy and data infrastructure to support it. Both funders
have different open access publishing requirements, with Wellcome having a defined open access repository,
Europe PubMed Central and grant holders expected to make their publications available within 6 months;
ESRC-funded researchers are required to only make publications open access within 12 months. Also the
funding models for open access, via institutional block grants and individual grants, differ. This parallel survey
was carried out in August-September 2016 and received 259 responses.
Both surveys provided very detailed and granular quantifiable information to test existing perceptions and
knowledge about these topics for a specific research community. The detailed findings can serve as baseline
evidence to develop very specific actions targeted at different groups of researchers. Survey data and focus
group transcripts have been published via the UK Data service.",2557824923; 2130893960; 2769901985; 2770182498; 2769032459; 2151003219; 2770815979; 2080357254; 2619770420,Veerle Van den Eynden; Gareth Knight; Anca Vlad; Barry Radler; Carol Tenopir; David A.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided bioinformatics developers with a forum for communicating the results of their latest efforts to the wider research community. BOSC offers a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about standards; software development practices; practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; and approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results, and software. BOSC is run as a two-day special interest group (SIG) before the annual Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference. BOSC 2015 took place in Dublin, Ireland, and was attended by over 125 people, about half of whom were first-time attendees.

We argued that the epistemological concern that heightened stringency regarding false-positives will by definition increase false-negatives is unwarranted given that open science proponents are not proposing reducing the nominal α level (from .05 to .01 for e.g.), but rather recommend open science practices to bring down the inflated Type I error rate from ~35% (due to design and analytic flexibility; Simmons et al., 2011) back down to 5%. The concern is also unwarranted given that numerous voices within the open science movement have clearly called for higher-powered research to reduce Type II error rates (currently ~70%, Bakker et al., 2012). Hence, open science practices reduce both Type I and Type II error rates, and we further demonstrate this via three concrete examples. As a secondary objective, we scrutinized pragmatic concerns raised regarding the application of open science practices with respect to pre-registration, open materials, open data, close replications, and sample size recommendations. In each of these cases, we show that the concerns are unjustified (e.g., pre-registration being non-sensical for longitudinal studies), exaggerated (e.g., practical impossibility of publicly sharing dyadic data), unwarranted (e.g., intellectual property issues of open materials and copyright issues of open data), or indefensible (e.g., increased sample size recommendations being ill-advised where participant recruitment is particularly difficult or expensive). We end by commending these researchers for their contributions that have helped sharpen and advance the discussion of the merits of open science practices, as evidenced by the existence of our article. In this sense, we agree with Finkel et al. (2015) that “research practices in our field will be better – in terms of scientific discovery and validity – in 2020 than",2022178797; 2039053016; 2138657055,Etienne P. LeBel; Timothy J.

To reach that aim, the Open Science and Research (ATT) Initiative was launched in 2014. Lead by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the ATT Initiative has funded a number of projects that support good research data management, opening of research data, and Open Access in general. The Initiative also emphasises cooperation and interoperability nationally, and internationally. The National Library of Finland and other research libraries have an important role in the ATT Initiative. Libraries are in a good position to make meaningful contributions as they can repurpose their expertise on metadata, information retrieval, and collection management. They are finding new ways of collaboration and creating services in the fields of Open Access and Open Science. Libraries and other service providers should, first and foremost, respect the needs of research and researchers: science should always be the guiding force. But Open Access and Open Science do have an effect on how research is conducted and published. Therefore, it must be possible to have a critical look on conventional research practices. Increasing amounts of data, new technological possibilities, and new methods of analysis mean that old practices need to be revised. The more pronounced demands of interoperability and innovative re-usability drive for change, too. Of course, the funders are also very keen on cost-efficiency and measurable impact. There is a demand for harmonisation, collaboration, and shared infrastructures and services. The Open Scientific Publishing Project (TAJUA) in the National Library of Finland is a part of the ATT Initiative. The main focus of the project is to increase and improve the availability of Finnish research output. It comprises of several subprojects that build on the existing expertise of the Library, taking it to new directions. They deal with improving the institutional repository infrastructure provided by the National Library, with special attention to organisations with restricted resources and basic demands; better guidance for institutional repositories on best practices in metadata creation, licensing, and in gathering statistics in a commensurable manner; a tool for easy creation of metadata about research datasets; improved persistent identifier services (ISNI, ORCID, URN, etc.); better understanding of economics of Open Access publishing, e.g. real level of APC, and recommendations for changes in publishing workflows; and recommendations for ensuring long-term accessibility of scientific output. The TAJUA project complements others under the umbrella of the ATT Initiative. They deal with more efficient publishing workflows, data management planning, opening datasets, training and education on Open Science, and tools to enrich and work up open linked data. Existing national services on data storage, preservation, and dissemination will also be extended. Research libraries should not be shy about their knowledge and skills. With metadata being the new black, they can really make their mark on the world of Open Science.",2640432942; 2572273734,Esa-Pekka Keskitalo; Tanja Vienonen

We show that the volume of publications has dramatically increased in the past year. In 2014 there have been over 888 publications with ‘ebola’ or ‘ebolavirus’ in the title, approximately 13 times the volume of publication of 2013. The rise reflects an impressive growth starting in the month of August, concomitant with or following the surge in infections, deaths and coverage in news and social media. Though non-research articles have been the major contributors to this growth, there has been a substantial increase in original research articles too, including many papers of basic science. The United States has been the country with the highest number of research articles, followed by Canada and the United Kingdom. We present a comprehensive set of charts and facts that, by describing the volumes and nature of publications in 2014, show how the scientific community has responded to the Ebola outbreak and how it might respond to future similar global threats and media events. This information will assist scholars and policymakers in their efforts to improve scientific research policies with the goal of maximizing both public health and knowledge advancement.",2202533312; 1851960627,Andrea Ballabeni; Andrea Boggio

It briefly visits the seventeenth-century origins of this double concept of intellectual property (IP), with particular attention paid to John Locke (who provides the basis of IP as a personal possession as well as furthering the idea of a ‘common-wealth of learning’) and the emergence of ‘open science’. The argument proceeds on two levels, educational and public, as it draws parallels between the way that students are taught to regard learning and the way in which a knowledge-based global economy treats learning. On the first level, that of the personal, the article puts forward a critique of the common educational tendency to treat learning as a private good, in terms of personal asset management, which ultimately undermines the common-wealth of learning and the idea of knowledge as a public good.

However, such initiatives may also adversely affect “open-science”. Based on matched surveys of almost 1000 researchers in Japan and over 800 in the US, the paper examines rates of commercial activity, reasons to patent, and secrecy related to research results. In particular, it examines the extent to which participation in commercial activity is associated with publication secrecy. The results show that patenting rates are higher in Japan, while industry funding is more common in the US. In addition, the overall level of publication secrecy is greater in Japan. And, in both countries, individuals who are commercially active are less likely to share their research results through publication. But, patents are less directly linked to commercial activity in Japan than in the US, and have less impact on academic secrecy. The results suggest that academic entrepreneurship is associated with reduced participation in open science, but that the extent of adverse effects depends significantly on institutional context.",2139778172; 2585090400,John P.

The applications span a wide range of domains, from investigation of fundamental problems in turbulence through computational materials science research to biomedical applications at the forefront of HIV/AIDS research and cerebrovascular haemodynamics. This work was mainly performed on the US TeraGrid ‘petascale’ resource, Ranger, at Texas Advanced Computing Center, in the first half of 2008 when it was the largest computing system in the world available for open scientific research. We have sought to use this petascale supercomputer optimally across application domains and scales, exploiting the excellent parallel scaling performance found on up to at least 32 768 cores for certain of our codes in the so-called ‘capability computing’ category as well as high-throughput intermediate-scale jobs for ensemble simulations in the 32–512 core range. Furthermore, this activity provides evidence that conventional parallel programming with MPI should be successful at the petascale in the short to medium term. We also report on the parallel performance of some of our codes on up to 65 636 cores on the IBM Blue Gene/P system at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, which has recently been named the fastest supercomputer in the world for open science.",2308030189; 2133456102; 2421642460; 1993668209; 1964499488; 1932225373; 2149543076; 2128727657; 2005902203; 2589174350,Radhika S.

The rise and decline of a database could be transient, but vividly reflect the interactions between society and the booming development of science and technology. The non-profit Biomolecular In-teraction Network Database (BIND) was once very prosperous but faded just in a few years. Its open access concept finally ended with an unsuccessful commercialization. In this process, BIND tried to establish a new paradigm in the scholarly world. Meanwhile, it was also a result of the affection of emerging technologies like Open Science data. Establishing and running a massive scientific database is not a pure technique activity within the scholarly community. The attitudes of gov-ernments and enterprises determined the fate of BIND to a large degree. Considering scientific da-tabase as a “public instrument” leads to a dilemma. The apparently different attitudes towards scientific database among various scientists, governments, and enterprises, in fact, reveal the social cost of the transition from scientific knowledge to public knowledge in the contemporary era.",2694054521; 2591723922,李昂; 孙烈

The Bioinformatics Open Source Conference (BOSC) is a yearly meeting organized by the Open Bioinformatics Foundation (OBF), a non-profit group dedicated to promoting the practice and philosophy of Open Source software development and Open Science within the biological research community. BOSC has been run since 2000 as a two-day Special Interest Group (SIG) before the annual ISMB conference. The 17th annual BOSC ( http://www.open-bio.org/wiki/BOSC_2016) took place in Orlando, Florida in July 2016. As in previous years, the conference was preceded by a two-day collaborative coding event open to the bioinformatics community. The conference brought together nearly 100 bioinformatics researchers, developers and users of open source software to interact and share ideas about standards, bioinformatics software development, and open and reproducible science.",2149860172; 2111553357; 2464865069; 2137704066; 790126700; 2030647757; 2569444445; 2690292806,Nomi L.

When taken together and kept in proper balance, these form a complementary pair of institutionally differentiated sub-systems. Each can work to amplify and augment the productivity of the other, thereby spurring long-term economic growth and improvements of social welfare in knowledge-driven societies. This paper considers the difference between historical origins of open science and its modern, critically important role in the allocation of research resources. The institutional structure of The Republic of Open Science generally is less well understood and has less robust self-sustaining foundations than the familiar non-cooperative market mechanisms associated with proprietary RD. Although they are better suited for the conduct of exploratory science, they also remain more vulnerable to damages from collateral effects of shifts in government policies, particularly those that impact their fiscal support and regulatory environments. After reviewing the several challenges that such policy actions during the 20th centurys closing decades had posed for continued effective collective explorations at the frontiers of scientific knowledge, the discussion examines the responses that those developments elicited from academic research communities. Those reactions to the threatened curtailment of timely access to data and technical information about new research methods and findings took the form of technical and organizational innovations designed to expand and enhance infrastructural protections for sustained open access in scientific and scholarly communications. They were practical, bottom-up initiatives to provide concrete, domain relevant tools and organizational routines whose adoption subsequently could be, and in the event were reinforced by top-down policy guidelines and regulatory steps by public funding agencies and international bodies. The non-politicized nature of that process, as well as its largely effective outcomes should be read cautiously as positive portents of the future vitality of the Republic of Open Science and of those societies that recognize, protect and adequately support this remarkable social innovation.",2652281210,Paul David

Policies are developed to enhance data sharing, ensure open-access, and harmonize international standards and ethics rules in order to promote access to existing resources and increase scientific output. In tandem with this promotion of data sharing, numerous ethics policies are developed to control data flows and protect privacy and confidentiality. Both sets of policy making, however, pay limited attention to the moral decisions and social ties enacted in the everyday routines of scientific work. This paper takes its point of departure in the practices of a Danish laboratory with great experience in international collaboration regarding genetic research. We focus on a simple query, what makes genetic material and health data flow, and which hopes and concerns travel along with them? We explore what we call the flows, the nonflows, and the overflows of material and information, and we document the wor...",699380770; 2682387486; 2176236466,Klaus Hoeyer; Aaro Tupasela; Malene B.

The approach was to explore the juxtaposition of research governance at the institutional level and local research practices at the project level. Interview questions focused on research inputs, software development processes, access to resources, project documentation, dissemination of outputs and by‐products, licensing issues, and institutional contracts.Findings – The findings suggest that, although there is a widely shared ethos of openness in everyday research practice, there are many uncertainties and yet‐to‐be resolved issues, despite strong policy imperatives towards openly shared resources.Research limitations/implications – The paper concludes by observing a stratification of openn...",2116253019; 2115686201; 2251033508,Jenny Fry; Ralph Schroeder; Matthijs den Besten

In this study, we introduce an agent-based model that is based on information foraging and expectancy theory to examine the impact of rationality and openness on the growth and evolution of scientific domains. We simulate a virtual socio-technical system, in which scientists with different preferences search for problem domains to contribute knowledge, while considering their motivational gains. Problem domains become mature and knowledge spills occur over time to facilitate creation of new problem domains. We conduct experiments to examine emergence and growth of clusters of domains based on local interactions and preferences of scientists and present preliminary qualitative observations.",2309079452; 1660732377,Özgür Özmen; Levent Yilmaz

It represented a departure from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of Nature’s Secrets, and its emergence was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the Scientific Revolution. The development of norms of disclosure and demonstration, and the rise of “cooperative rivalries” in the revelation of new knowledge, constituted a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems that had been posed for the Renaissance system of court-patronage of the arts and sciences. Pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exaccerbated by the claims of mathematicians and the increasing practical reliance upon new mathematical techniques in a variety of “contexts of application.” In late Renaissance Europe, the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority had resulted in relations between noble patrons and their savant-clients that resembled the situation modern economists describe as ""common agency contracting in substitutes"" -- competititon among incompletely informed principals for the dedicated services of multiple agents. These conditions not only induced the formation of mechanisms enabling would?be clients to build public reputations for scientific expertise and credibility, but also tended to result in more favorable contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) for the agent?client members of western Europe's nascent scientific communities. Foundations were thus laid for the later seventeenth and eighteenth century institutionalization of the open pursuit of scientific knowledge under the auspices of State-sponsored academies. Rather than being a novel departure induced by the needs of the new style of inquiry, those institutional developments continued a broader intellectual and cultural movement that had been underway in Europe outside the medieval universities. This had manifested itself in the formation of myriad academies that were the precursor form of the private scientific societies that appeared under elite patronage early in the seventeenth century. The ethos and norms of disclosure, and the characteristic supporting institutions of modern, publicly funded open scientific research are, in an important sense, independent historical legacies; they were not derivative from the epistemological aspects of the Scientific Revolution, although to a considerable degree they have been responsible for the successes that “the scientific method” has achieved in the production of reliable knowledge. The fragility of these cooperative features of “the R&D infrastructure” needs to be keep in mind by science policy makers. Working Papers Index",2584665884,Paul A. David

In particular, the Menpo Project provides tools for annotating images and meshes with a sparse set of fiducial markers that we refer to as landmarks. For example, Figure 1 shows an example of a face image that has been annotated with 68 2D landmarks. These landmarks are useful in a variety of areas in Computer Vision and Machine Learning including object detection, deformable modelling and tracking. The Menpo Project aims to enable researchers, practitioners and students to easily annotate new data sources and to investigate existing datasets. Of most interest to the Computer Vision is the fact that The Menpo Project contains completely open source implementations of a number of state-of-the-art algorithms for face detection and deformable model building . In the Menpo Project, we are actively developing and contributing to the state-of-the-art in deformable modelling [2], [3], [4], [5]. Characteristic examples of widely used state-of-the-art deformable model algorithms are Active Appearance Models [6],[7], Constrained Local Models [8], [9] and Supervised Descent Method [10]. However, there is still a noteworthy lack of high quality open source software in this area. Most existing packages are encrypted, compiled, non-maintained, partly documented, badly structured or difficult to modify. This makes them unsuitable for adoption in cutting edge scientific research. Consequently, research becomes even more difficult since performing a fair comparison between existing methods is, in most cases, infeasible. For this reason, we believe the Menpo Project represents an important contribution towards open science in the area of deformable modelling. We also believe it is important for deformable modelling to move beyond the established area of facial annotations and to extend to a wide variety of deformable object classes. We hope Menpo can accelerate this progress by providing all of our tools completely free and permissively licensed.",176797219; 1583203920; 2308026219; 2229774997; 2293457281,Joan Alabort-i-Medina; Epameinondas Antonakos; James Booth; Patrick Snape; Stefanos Zafeiriou

However, the most important scientific ally is that which can assist in the complex task of identifying, collecting and treating the exponential amount of data added to the Web every day in the XXI century. Moreover, the volume of this data exceeds 2.5 x 10 18 new bytes per day and arrives on the Web at a rapid speed. Thus, it is necessary to assess the veracity of these data and their value to decision-making. Although approximately 43% of the data are related to health and about one million scientific articles published per year are in the health field, it is important to think beyond trivial models to solve problems of local health with a global focus. Thus, this work aims to contribute to the reflection on the use of free tools as well as to discussions of collaborative and effective partnerships for action in the field of Public Health . This study shows opportunities to use open science for global health innovation, mainly, to the countries with difficulty in managing the problems of their ills. Open science in times of Big Data are much more agile than the old model of closed science, i.e., isolated groups that either did not share data or did share but at prices that were unaffordable for developing or underdeveloped countries. Technological development for new chemical entities can be facilitated by using the open science of the Scientific’s Big Data .",2064914861; 2304163041; 2117520929; 2421092785,Jorge Lima de Magalhães; Zulmira Maria de Araújo Hartz; Adelaide Maria de Souza Antunes; Maria do Rosário Oliveira Martins

In partnership with competent authorities and research organisations in the Member States, EFSA has become a central hub of the European data on food consumption, chemical occurrence and foodborne outbreaks. Beyond EFSA's use of these data and sharing of contaminants and food consumption data with the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization to support international risk assessment, they remain largely unexploited. In addition, for some of its risk assessments, EFSA also relies on published information, as well as on scientific studies sponsored and submitted by industry. The environment in which the Authority operates has significantly evolved since its foundation. The growth of digital technology has granted scientists and consumers alike faster and more efficient access to data and information. The open data movement, which has entered the sphere of the European Union institutions, is unleashing the potential for reuse of data. In parallel, the work of EFSA is increasingly subject to demands for more openness and transparency across its spectrum of stakeholders. EFSA aims to enhance the quality and transparency of its outputs by giving access to data and promoting the development of collaborative platforms in Europe and internationally. EFSA also plans to work with data providers and organisations funding research to adopt open data concepts and standards; gaining better access to, and making better use of, data from a wider evidence base. During the breakout session on ‘Open Risk Assessment: Data’ at the EFSA 2nd Scientific Conference ‘Shaping the Future of Food Safety, Together’ (Milan, Italy, 14–16 October 2015) opportunities and challenges associated with open data, data interoperability and data quality were discussed by sharing experiences from various sectors within and outside EFSA's remit. This paper provides an overview of the presentations and discussions during the breakout session.",2646865992; 2460587289; 2468889165; 2663209656; 2599119461,Mary B.

Although scientists benefit from many forms of collaboration on the Web e.g., blogs, wikis, forums, code sharing, etc., most collaborative projects are coordinated over email, phone calls, and in-person meetings. Our goal is to develop a collaborative infrastructure for scientists to work on complex science questions that require multi-disciplinary contributions to gather and analyze data, that cannot occur without significant coordination to synthesize findings, and that grow organically to accommodate new contributors as needed as the work evolves over time. Our approach is to develop an organic data science framework based on a task-centered organization of the collaboration, includes principles from social sciences for successful on-line communities, and exposes an open science process. Our approach is implemented as an extension of a semantic wiki platform, and captures formal representations of task decomposition structures, relations between tasks and users, and other properties of tasks, data, and other relevant science objects. All these entities are captured through the semantic wiki user interface, represented as semantic web objects, and exported as linked data.",2145802646; 2108051091; 2059913085; 2143581872; 1293062853; 2161238459; 2149727138; 2000421245,Yolanda Gil; Felix Michel; Varun Ratnakar; Jordan S.

However, this trend has aroused concern about a potentially negative impact on the tradition of open science. Drawing on a survey data of 698 Japanese natural scientists, this study analyzes the behaviors and norms of university scientists under the influence of university interventions for entrepreneurship, whereby examining the compatibility between entrepreneurship and open science. The results indicate that entrepreneurial interventions have facilitated scientists’ norm for practical contribution, and consequently, their involvement in commercial activities and ties with industry. Then, some, but not all, of these entrepreneurial activities have deterred cooperative or open relationships between scientists. However, the results suggest that the entrepreneurial interventions have not deteriorated the traditional norm for open science. Further analyses indicate that the two norms for practical contribution and for open science are determined independently, implying that academic entrepreneurship can be promoted without deteriorating open science.",2162300226,Sotaro Shibayama

services. The development and sustainable operation of such e-infrastructures are at the forefront of European funding priorities. The research community, however, is still reluctant to engage at the scale required to signal a Europe-wide change in the mode of operation of scientific practices. The striking differences in uptake rates between
researchers from different scientific domains indicate that communities do not equally share the benefits of the above European investments. We highlight the need to support
research communities in organically engaging with the European Open Science Cloud through the development of trustworthy and interoperable Virtual Research Environments.
These domain-specific solutions can support communities in gradually bridging technical and socio-cultural gaps between traditional and open digital science practice, better diffusing the benefits of European e-infrastructures.",2256514223; 1770249587; 2693251598; 137719847; 2126078610; 2264123169; 1775587805; 2715013533; 2106736602; 2298964904; 2102118488; 2022664583; 2649520394; 2304709232; 2553755079; 2077677394; 2171750220; 2441312371; 1979592940,Dimitrios Koureas; Donald Hobern; Arnald Marcer; Daniel Mietchen; David R.

Arguably, these three forms and discourses represent three recent related but different conceptions of the knowledge economy, each with clear significance and implications for education and education policy. The last provides a model of radically non-propertarian form that incorporates both ‘open education’ and ‘open science’ economies.",2555691151,Michael A. Peters

These three strategic priorities put a particular emphasis on the construction of students’ scientific identity. The guiding research question is as follows: What is the relationship between students’ scientific identity and English for Academic Purposes? Therefore, the aim of the present research is to analyse the scientific literature on the relationship between students’ scientific identity and English for Academic Purposes underpinning elaboration of a new research question for further studies. The theoretical framing herein will discuss the construction of scientific identity via academic language. The meaning of such key concepts as scientific identity and role models is studied. Moreover, the study demonstrates how the key concepts are related to the idea of English for Academic Purposes. The study demonstrates a logical chain: scientific identity → English for Academic Purposes → role models → an empirical study within a multicultural environment → conclusions. Research methods include theoretical and empirical methods. Theoretical methods comprise analysis of theoretical sources and theoretical modelling. In the empirical study, explorative study was employed. Interpretative research paradigm was used. The empirical study carried out in August 2015 involved 22 engineering students at Tallinn University of Technology, Estonia. The results of the empirical study show that engineering students’ self-evaluation is of the low level. The findings of the research allow drawing the conclusion that use of role models in English for Academic Purposes is an opportunity for the construction of students’ scientific identity. The novel contribution of the paper is revealed in the newly formulated research question. Directions of further research are proposed.",2592692610,Kant Baltic

It has been suggested that cooperative strategies such as open source could correct the inadequacies generated by the application of the patent system to biotechnological inventions. However, most of the critics of the patent system presume its inefficiency on the basis of theoretical arguments that have not been confirmed by the existing evidence. Before discussing the feasibility of implementing cooperative strategies in the field of biotechnology, should we not ensure that such strategies are really needed to improve the system? We addressed this question by investigating the claim that the patent system has created an anticommons effect in the field of biotechnology. Our evaluation of the available empirical data demonstrates the absence of a widespread anticommons effect and thus the inadequacy of using this theory as a central argument in favour of the use of open source approaches in biotechnology. Ultimately, the use of open source approaches should be justified on the individual merits of these strategies rather than on the basis of theoretical inefficiencies of the patent system. Consequently, our article will analyze the various potential benefits of open source reported in the literature. The strategic use of collaborative approaches such as open source could facilitate the development of a dynamic and functional biomedical research sector in academia, one that continues to work in the spirit of open science.",1973113305,Yann Joly

Supporting Open Science, an effort to make scientific research data accessible to all interested parties by openly publishing research and encouraging others to do the same thereby making it easier to communicate scientific knowledge, is a part of the change that has become increasingly important for (digital) libraries. Digital libraries are able to play a significant role in enabling Open Science by facilitating data sharing, discovery and re-use. Because data citation is often mentioned as one incentive for data sharing, enabling data citation is a crucial feature of research data services. In this article we present a case study of data citation services for the High-Energy Physics (HEP) community using digital library technology. Our example shows how the concept of data citation is implemented for the complete research workflow, covering data production, publishing, citation and tracking of data reuse.

There are many reasons why science modules require and desire a practical element to their design. There is an underlying conviction that hands-on experience is integral to learning about a science subject (Nersassian, 1991). Some other reasons are: to align with regulatory frameworks, to provide transferable skills, to encourage team working, and to develop employability skills. Many of these practical skills can be developed via mobile learning",2238975421,Victoria Nicholas

Given ongoing debates on video game influences, comments varied from the supportive to the self-proclaimed ""angry,"" yet hopefully they and this response will contribute to constructive discussion as the field moves forward. In this reply, I address some misconceptions in the comments and present data that challenge the assumption that standardized regression coefficients are invariably unsuitable for meta-analysis or that bivariate correlations are invariably suitable for meta-analysis. The suitability of any data should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and data indicates that the coefficients included in the ""Angry Birds"" meta-analysis did not distort results. Study selection, effect size extraction, and interpretation improved upon problematic issues in other recent meta-analyses. Further evidence is also provided to support the contention that publication bias remains problematic in video game literature. Sources of acrimony among scholars are explored as are areas of agreement. Ultimately, debates will only be resolved through a commitment to newer, more rigorous methods and open science.

Major policy developments can be seen in funding agencies mandating open access to scientific results. However, the idea of Open Science represents an alternate approach to the scientific process enabled by digital technologies encompassing the entire research cycle, including how researchers are being evaluated and rewarded. Still, even though the idea of Open Science is envisioned as a systematic change in the way science is performed, the scientific communities remain largely ignorant on this issue.This paper presents a theoretical discussion on how academics might adopt the idea of Open Science by scrutinizing the background and evolution of this policy agenda and the issues arising from it, and by analyzing academias perception of and behavior toward Open Science. The misalignment of Open Science purposes and the researchers value is pointed out as the major impediment to realization of Open Science concept.",2228712889,Miho Funamori

The field of MBE research was conceived based on the reasoning that modern humans spend most of their time indoors (where they come into contact with countless microor- ganisms), yet we know relatively little about the microbes and microbial ecosys- tems that exist within buildings. The microBEnet project began in 2010 and was funded as one of the keystone initiatives in the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s program in Micro- biology of the Built Environment (http://www.sloan.org/major-program- areas/basic-research/mobe/). The first phase of microBEnet represented a close, crossdisciplinary collaboration between the Eisen laboratory at the University of California (UC), Davis (microbiology and genomics research), and Hal Levin at the Building Ecology Research Group in Santa Cruz, California (building science). In the first three years of the project, microBEnet focused on four categories of activities in order to facil- itate work in the MBE field and to build a culture of openness and sharing: 1. Organizing meetings and workshops 2. Creating, curating, and sharing online resources and information 3. Enabling and educating network par- ticipants about more ‘‘open’’ activities in the field 4. Leveraging social media to encourage communication and collaboration These activities have targeted audiences in three main categories: 1. Researchers funded as part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s MBE program 2. Other researchers working in the MBE program, or related fields, who could gain benefits or make valuable contri- butions 3. ‘‘Stakeholders’’ such as the general public and funding agencies who make decisions that should both be influ- enced by and influence our under- standing of the MBE The microBEnet project has served as a new breed of forward-looking research coordination network (akin to initiatives funded through government agencies such as the National Science Foundation). Many network activities have been exper- imental in nature, leveraging new tools and technology to foster interdisciplinary interactions (see Box 1). In terms of goals, we strived to be nimble and dynamic during the first 3 years of the project. Online networks and the study of the MBE itself were both considered ‘‘un- charted territory’’, and microBEnet was tasked with responding to community needs and suggestions. In this commen- tary, we discuss some of the lessons we have learned so far from microBEnet, with a view to facilitating the development of similar initiatives in other fields. We particularly focus on the role of open science activities in relation to community building efforts, public outreach and research-driven teaching projects, and the benefits and challenges of interdisci- plinary interactions. Being, Building, and Teaching ‘‘Openness’’ In addition to the creation of a new research field, a parallel overall goal of microBEnet is to help lead the MBE field to be a broadly open, sharing community. The importance of ‘‘openness’’ and edu- cating others on how to conduct open science, has been a central theme for much of our project. This includes both creating and curating open content and building an open social media network where anyone is welcome. Although openness is not necessary and sufficient to catalyze the creation of a new research field such as the MBE, we have chosen to emphasize this concept while building microBEnet because of the potential for Citation: Bik HM, Coil DA, Eisen JA (2014) microBEnet: Lessons Learned from Building an Interdisciplinary Scientific Community in the Online Sphere.

theme. Within this framework, the steering committee of the GEOHAB Core Research Project on HABs in Fjords
and Coastal Embayments has organized two OSMs. The first OSM was held in 2004 in Santiago, Chile;
the major goals were to identify the primary research priorities and to initiate an agenda to further our understanding of HAB dynamics in these small-scale coastal systems. The second OSM was held in May 2012 in Victoria,Canada to highlight the progress accomplished since the first OSM and to focus attention on the importance of a comparative approach in conducting ecosystem studies to improve our understanding of HABs. This second OSM addressed four major themes for which significant advances have been made in recent years,
with particular focus on their application to semi-enclosed basins linked to coastal ecosystems: (1) Life
history of HAB species; (2) Chemical ecological and toxin interactions; (3) Genetic diversity and (4) Transport and mixing of blooms in small-scale, mesoscale and semi-confined systems.

This Report presents the major outcomes of this OSM, followed by recommendations for future collaborative
studies. These recommendations include the maintenance of international activities on the ecology and oceanography of HABs after the end of the GEOHAB programme in December 2013. A future agenda
should focus on a few key questions with clearly identifiable deliverables. These questions should include
the development of (i) improved methods to determine the rates of cyst formation and germination in the field,
and (ii) coupled biological-physical-chemical models more appropriate to small-scale environments and
which incorporate the role of allelochemicals and toxins, as well as the pelagic and benthic coupling components. Research devoted to life history stages should be continued, particularly with respect to fish-killing algal species that cause particular damage in coastal environments. The influence of aquaculture activities on the development of HABs is poorly understood and should be of greater concern in future research on HABs. The influence of climate change, which may be exacerbated
in coastal environments, also should be a focus of future research. Long-term ecological research should be
encouraged in this respect, in order to make better predictions in the future concerning the development of
HABs in coastal environments.",2462499492; 1973084709; 2683557392; 2645474585,Suzanne Roy; Vera Pospelova; M. Montresor; A. Cembella

The chapters in this study present subject-specific views on OA infrastructure for research by analysing research workflows as well as researcher behaviours. They specifically take into account two aspects, namely (i) working with literature and (ii) working with data. Throughout the preceding chapters and throughout this chapter, the topic of OA infrastructure is centred on digital resources. Even though there are many transitions between physical and digital resources mentioned – for example, between the human researcher
and the computer or a digital resource, and the physical, experimental as well computational facilities – these transitions will not be addressed explicitly in most of the cases for the sake of lingual simplicity.
The following sections will discuss commonalities of and differences between the different presented views on OA infrastructure and formulate recommendations for supporting the development of infrastructure (e.g. through funding initiatives) under specific consideration of the question how principles of “openness” or OA can be applied. In line with the qualitative approach of
this whole study, the synthesis will be provided as an interpretative account.
When comparing the chapters, the most obvious observation can be summarised in one word: diversity. 
Attempting to provide a synthesis, the following sections will consequently analyse the commonalities and differences. This is done first on a high conceptual level and then on a detailed, systematic case-by-case basis. Thus, the resulting qualitative, rather than quantitative, account shall inform strategic decisions for future developments with respect to conceptual rather than procedural aspects. The specific measures, programmes or plans are assumed to be the result of these strategic decisions.",279825413; 2115979994,Christian Meier zu Verl; Wolfram Horstmann

To this end, a simulation-based exploratory study is conducted to better understand the conditions that confer increased rates of innovation in such socio-technical systems. Three types of open science communities are identified and simulated using agent simulation as a method of inquiry. Simulation results show that centrality, as a measure of degree of connectedness, exhibits positive influence for innovation output in exploratory and service communities up to a point. Also, utility-oriented communities have social network structures with low density and high centrality, suggesting high potential for innovation.",2160511730; 1660732377,Guangyu Zou; Levent Yilmaz

Its most important contribution is a demonstration how digitized library catalogues can become a crucial tool for scholarship and part of reproducible research. The article also suggests a novel way how to make a quantitative analysis of a particular trend in book production, namely publishing of history. This study is also our first experiment with the analysis of paper consumption in early modern book production. It demonstrates in practice the importance of open science principles for library and information science. The article studies three main research questions: 1) who wrote history 2) where was history published, and 3) how did publishing of history change over time in early modern Britain and North America. As the main findings, we demonstrate that the average book size for history publications becomes smaller over time and that the octavo-sized book is the rising vehicle of history in the eighteenth century that tells us factually about widening audiences. The article will also compare different aspects of most popular authors on history such as Edmund Burke and David Hume. While focusing on history publishing, these findings may reflect more widespread trends in publication in the early modern era, and this article illustrates how some of the key questions in this field can be assessed by statistical analysis of large-scale bibliographic data collections.",2085746606; 2186118725; 2192459837,Leo Lahti; Niko Ilomäki; Mikko Tolonen

It is possible to establish at least two phases that distinguish epistemological orientations and analytical interests. During the first phas a social science was constructed, the object of which was the economic system and its problems and dynamics. The interdisciplinary nature and substantive vocation of this were notable. In the second phase we witnessed what could be described as a disciplinary regression, with the domination of formalistic analyses. Empirically, through the analysis of three peer-reviewed journals (two economic and one interdisciplinary) and of the projects approved by Portugal's Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), we conclude there are several ways forward from the crossroads at which we now find ourselves. One of these is the insistence that economics is a 'science of the markets', which is legitimising and normative. Another values it as an open science that is based on pluralism and which has a critical relationship with reality.",2150092997,José Reis

Today researchers can choose from many bioinformatics protocols for all types of life sciences research, computational environments and coding languages. Although the majority of these are open source, few of them possess all virtues to maximize reuse and promote reproducible science. Wikipedia has proven a great tool to disseminate information and enhance collaboration between users with varying expertise and background to author qualitative content via crowdsourcing. However, it remains an open question whether the wiki paradigm can be applied to bioinformatics protocols.",387342658; 2159151550; 2056865132; 1416178009,Alexandros Kanterakis; Joël Kuiper; George Potamias; Morris A.

We propose to explore its disciplinary context by combining citation network exploration with semantic analysis. A database of citation neighbors of cybergeo articles is constructed through an automated data collection resulting in around 2.10^6 articles with abstracts. The extraction of relevant n-grams among the whole corpus allows to construct a semantic network by co-occurrences analysis. The optimisation of its size and modularity on construction parameters yields consistent disciplines by community detection, confirming the very rich scientific environment of cybergeo, that extends for example from economic geography and political sciences to biogeography and physical geography. We finally unveil epistemological informations such as occurrence proximities or citation links between disciplines, by the computation of community and article-level interdisciplinarity measures at the first order (abstract content) and second order (citation content).",2675628790,Juste Raimbault

This is responsible for providing a network service which authorizes remote users and provides a resource provisioning service (other well-known gateways include Globus GRAM, CREAM, Arc-CE, and Openstacks Nova). Based on the venerable HTCondor software, this new CE is simply a highly-specialized configuration of HTCondor. It was developed and adopted to provide the OSG with a more flexible, scalable, and easier-to-manage gateway software. Further, the focus of the HTCondor-CE is not job submission (as in GRAM or CREAM) but resource provisioning. This software does not exist in a vacuum: to deploy this gateway across the OSG, we had to integrate it with the CE configuration, deploy a corresponding information service, coordinate with sites, and overhaul our documentation.",2769352348; 2700545102; 2764613305; 2648966589; 2259972600; 2529847666; 2764979263; 2674452058,B Bockelman; T Cartwright; J Frey; E M Fajardo; B Lin; M Selmeci; T Tannenbaum; M Zvada

Back in 1981, government attempts to limit foreign visitors to U.S. laboratories and control access to fundamental research projects led to widespread academic anger. The Department of DefenseâUniversities Forum in the early 1980s, of which I was co-chair, struggled to resolve difficulties presented by applications (for example, of international arms traffic regulations) to withhold access to basic, nonmilitary research. For years, only limited gains were made, but in 1985, to everyone's surprise, President Ronald Reagan ended this long-running controversy by executing National Security Decision Directive (NSDD) 189. NSDD 189 provided that only classification could be used to limit the disclosure of basic research results. It was a stunning policy shift that delighted the scientific community.",2106076193,Donald Kennedy

Several leading research and engineering groups participated in this effort that was funded by the US National Institutes of Health through a variety of infrastructure grants. This effort transformed 3D Slicer from an internal, Boston-based, academic research software application into a professionally maintained, robust, open source platform with an international leadership and developer and user communities. Critical improvements to the widely used underlying open source libraries and tools—VTK, ITK, CMake, CDash, DCMTK—were an additional consequence of this effort. This project has contributed to close to a thousand peer-reviewed publications and a growing portfolio of US and international funded efforts expanding the use of these tools in new medical computing applications every year. In this editorial, we discuss what we believe are gaps in the way medical image computing is pursued today; how a well-executed research platform can enable discovery, innovation and reproducible science (“Open Science”); and how our quest to build such a software platform has evolved into a productive and rewarding social engineering exercise in building an open-access community with a shared vision.",2029930633; 2076921266; 2050423717; 2138019518; 2130921562; 2139631899; 339098853; 108769240; 708860026; 2145028108; 2123713937; 2168306485; 2107364016; 2280289655; 2190078457; 2167330059; 430561134; 2136032002; 2107357764; 2063924068; 2776958842; 908076792; 2142299523; 2236152522; 2661068657; 2119047112; 2104096890; 1995082470; 1912398602,Tina Kapur; Julien Finet; Sonia Pujol; Jayender Jagadeesan; Junichi Tokuda; Isaiah Norton; Raúl San José Estépar; David T.

Results indicate that high levels of academic entrepreneurship in a scientific field are associated with less reliance on the gift-giving form of sharing (i.e., generalized exchange) traditionally recommended by scientific communities, and with a greater emphasis on direct benefits for givers (i.e., direct exchange), as well as a lower overall frequency of sharing. We observe these shifts in sharing behavior even among individual scientists who are not themselves entrepreneurially active; this suggests a general shift in scientific norms contingent on institutional contexts. These findings reflect contradictions inherent in current science policies that simultaneously encourage open science as well as commercial application of research results, and they suggest that the increasing emphasis on commercial activity may fundamentally change the normative structure of science.",2162300226; 2139778172; 2467384774,Sotaro Shibayama; John P.

The project has developed a modular simulation engine to create computational models of the worm. The modularity of the engine makes it possible to easily modify the model, incorporate new experimental data and test hypotheses. The modeling framework incorporates both biophysical neuronal simulations and a novel fluid-dynamics-based soft-tissue simulation for physical environment-body interactions. The project's open-science approach is aimed at overcoming the difficulties of integrative modeling within a traditional academic environment.

A key part of this effort is a move towards open data as a way to fight post-publication data loss, improve data and code quality, enable powerful meta- and cross-disciplinary analyses, and increase trust in, and the efficiency of, publicly-funded research. Many scientists however lack experience in, and may be unsure of the benefits of, making their data and fully-reproducible analyses publicly available. Here we describe a recent 'open experiment', in which we documented every aspect of a soil incubation online, making all raw data, scripts, diagnostics, final analyses, and manuscripts available in real time. We found that using tools such as version control, issue tracking, and open-source statistical software improved data integrity, accelerated our team's communication and productivity, and ensured transparency. There are many avenues to improve scientific reproducibility and data availability, of which is this only one example, and it is not an approach suited for every experiment or situation. Nonetheless, we encourage the communities in our respective fields to consider its advantages, and to lead rather than follow with respect to scientific reproducibility, transparency, and data availability.",2311244916; 2416813426; 2163236234,Ben Bond-Lamberty; A.

Actually, transdisciplinary modelling of complex and uncertain environmental systems is challenging computational science (CS) and also the science-policy interface. Large spatial-scale problems falling within this category - i.e. wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling for environment (WSTMe) - often deal with factors for which deep-uncertainty may prevent usual statistical analysis of modelled quantities and need different ways for providing policy-making with science-based support. Here, practical recommendations are proposed for tempering a peculiar - not infrequently underestimated - source of uncertainty. Software errors in complex WSTMe may subtly affect the outcomes with possible consequences even on collective environmental decision-making. Semantic transparency in CS and free software are discussed as possible mitigations. [...]",2678104154,Daniele de Rigo

It provides a brief overview of the emergence of special protections for children (and other vulnerable groups) in research and discusses whether the same ethical distinctions apply in pediatric DIS. It proposes the sharing of pediatric genomic data with attention to three levels of responsibilities to the data source, the data process, and data impact.",2636436499,V. Rahimzadeh

A systematic review of published data from 37 studies worldwide (including Canada) found the median under-reporting rate of adverse events to be 94% in spontaneous reporting systems. This scoping review aims to assess the utility of social media and crowd-sourced data to detect and monitor adverse events related to health products including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, biologics and natural health products. Methods and analysis Our review conduct will follow the Joanna Briggs Institute scoping review methods manual. Literature searches were conducted in MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Library from inception to 13 May 2016. Additional sources included searches of study registries, conference abstracts, dissertations, as well as websites of international regulatory authorities (eg, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the WHO, European Medicines Agency). Search results will be supplemented by scanning the references of relevant reviews. We will include all publication types including published articles, editorials, websites and book sections that describe use of social media and crowd-sourced data for surveillance of adverse events associated with health products. Two reviewers will perform study selection and data abstraction independently, and discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. Data analysis will involve quantitative (eg, frequencies) and qualitative (eg, content analysis) methods. Dissemination The summary of results will be sent to Health Canada, who commissioned the review, and other relevant policymakers involved with the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network. We will compile and circulate a 1-page policy brief and host a 1-day stakeholder meeting to discuss the implications, key messages and finalise the knowledge translation strategy. Findings from this review will ultimately inform the design and development of a data analytics platform for social media and crowd-sourced data for pharmacovigilance in Canada and internationally.

It explores an alternative intellectual project which will facilitate new research agendas and publication directions that will simultaneously speaks to the three wider audience of the present-day world: the sciences, the Global South and the Abrahamic religious traditions. My objective is to delineate a theological, geopolitical and anthropological exposition as an ethical anchorage for the present Bandung project to steadily move towards the Open Science era. I will argue for Ezekiel’s prophetic model as a plausible de-colonial option for crafting the transnational open knowledge space.",2558157862,Pak Nung Wong

These infrastructures are able to run embarrassingly parallel computation with high performance. Developing a way to join several cloud infrastructures together into one massive cloud would be especially useful to academic researchers who utilize open large-scale compute resources, like the Open Science Grid or the European Grid Infrastructure, together with open source cloud computing platforms such as Nimbus, in order to create their own private clouds with rather than say Amazon’s EC2.

With the advent of high-throughput technologies, a great wealth of variation data is being produced. Such information may constitute the basis for correlation analyses between genotypes and phenotypes and, in the future, for personalized medicine. Several databases on gene variation exist, but this kind of information is still scarce in the Semantic Web framework.

In this paper, we discuss issues related to the integration of mutation data in the Linked Open Data infrastructure, part of the Semantic Web framework. We present the development of a mapping from the IARC TP53 Mutation database to RDF and the implementation of servers publishing this data.",2111899370; 2590237068; 2236881542,Achille Zappa; Andrea Splendiani; Paolo Romano

However, while citizen science projects aim to improve scientific understanding, volunteer-based online experiment platforms currently provide minimal possibilities for research involvement and learning. The goal of this paper is to uncover opportunities for expanding participant involvement and learning in the research process. Analyzing comments from 8,288 volunteers who took part in four online experiments on LabintheWild, we identified six themes that reveal needs and opportunities for closer interaction between researchers and participants. Our findings demonstrate opportunities for research involvement, such as engaging participants in refining experiment implementations, and learning opportunities, such as providing participants with possibilities to learn about research aims. We translate these findings into ideas for the design of future volunteer-based online experiment platforms that are more mutually beneficial to citizen scientists and researchers.",2222106881; 2607254586; 2136495853,Nigini Oliveira; Eunice Jun; Katharina Reinecke

This problem is exacerbated, as firms increasingly develop their innovations or operate in countries with weak IPR institutional environments. But how does IPR uncertainty affect firms’ strategy toward knowledge appropriation — capturing of economic value from their knowledge assets — and toward providing access to these knowledge assets? Drawing on research from the economics of science and intellectual property strategy, we examine this question using a novel panel data covering 362 firms and organizations in the knowledge-intensive genomics industry based on all genomics patents and matching papers from 1988 to 2005. We find that under uncertain IPR conditions, firms reveal and accumulate more knowledge through open science (follow-on publishing) but shift to knowledge appropriation through commercial science (follow-on patenting) when IPR uncertainty is narrowed. This effect is most salient when firms develop their knowledge assets or operate under strong IPR institutional regime. For highly science-based knowledge assets, firms continue tapping into open science for access and reciprocity in knowledge acquisition from the scientific community.

The heterogeneity of subject innovation abilityis the inner logic of collaborative innovation in modern vocational education and industrial development from the perspective of open science. Based on the theory study and case analysis, collaborative innovation should be built on shared vision of multi- subjects of the education- industry, common interest of individual body and order parameters of the collaborative innovation framework, and the subject collaboration between schools and cooperations, the integration of value, interest and resource may lead to the construction of long term mechanism of collaborative innovation activities.",2351659024,Tang Zhibi

This initiative, part of the larger institutional transformations initiated in response to the economic ramifications of rapid progress in digital information technologies, poses numerous contentious issues in law and economics. These are likely to create ambiguities for business and non-profit activities in this area for years to come, and the terms on which those issues are resolved will materially affect the costs and organizational feasibility of scientific projects that are of global reach and significance. This is the case especially in fields such as geology, oceanography and climatology, which depend heavily upon the collection, management and analysis of large volumes of observational data that cannot be regenerated. More generally the conduct of open, collaborative science - along with many of the benefits that flow from it for the developed and the developing economies alike - may be seriously jeopardized by the consequences of the new database protections. This raises the spectre of a new and different ""tragedy of the commons,"" one created by continuing the unbalanced pressure to extract greater economic rents by means of controlling access to information. ""Over-fencing,"" which is to say, the erection of artificial cost barriers to the production of reliable public knowledge by means of reliable public knowledge, threatens the future of ""the public knowledge commons"" that historically has proved critically important for rapid advance in science and technology. The paper sets out the economic case for the effectiveness of open, collaborative research, and the forces behind the recent, countervailing rush to strengthen and expand the scope of intellectual property rights protection. Focusing upon innovations in copyright law and the sui generis protection of hitherto unprotected content, it documents the genesis and analyzes the economic implications of the EC''s Database Directive, and related legislative proposals (H.R. 3125, H.R. 354 and H.R. 1858) in the US. The discussion concludes by advancing a number of modest remedial proposals that are intended to promote greater efforts to arrive at satisfactory policy solutions for this aspect of ""the digital dilemma.""",2584665884,Paul A.

Various ""public law"" approaches to address this challenge, such as a common law experimental use exception to patent infringement, have achieved limited success. In the wake of these shortcomings, this Article argues that institutions that fund and support biomedical research are resorting to an underappreciated model of private ordering to resolve research holdup. Increasingly, federal and state agencies, universities, non-profits, and disease advocacy groups are conditioning vital research support on requirements that recipients of this support make resulting patented inventions widely available for noncommercial research purposes. In essence, these institutions are contractually constructing a biomedical research commons. These efforts represent a significant shift towards ""privatizing"" patent regulation. Through a new model of ""consideration-based patent regulation,"" public institutions are embedding policy objectives in contractual quid pro quos with individual recipients of research support. This model provides public institutions with considerable freedom to effectuate norms favoring wide dissemination of research technologies. This Article greets this development with cautious optimism, providing prescriptions for how public institutions may effectively manage the contractual construction of a biomedical research commons. It concludes by exploring the significant ramifications of this development for patent law, institutions, and theory.",2259051420,Peter Lee

When the Internet entered the academic world, the belief emerged that researchers could handle information on their own. Thus, the value of personal professional interaction between the academic librarian and the researcher diminished and was no longer prioritized in the library organization. The support provided by academic librarians shifted to represent a more service-oriented relationship. Concomitantly, the researchers regarded lack of time as the predominant factor interfering with their ability to improve their information retrieval skills in order to stay updated in their field. By looking back on the value of having a professional role as information specialists interacting closely with researchers, we can recreate, develop, and expand the support we offer in the future. Background: The Lund University Libraries network completed a project in 2013. The aim of that work was to identify areas that needed to be strengthened and developed to support researchers. We analyzed the results related to the Faculty of Medicine, focusing specifically on the local setting and the researchers’ need for support within the health sciences and medicine which led to initiation of the present in-depth study. Aim: The aim of our current project is to gain a better understanding of the researchers´needs of tailored support in their scientific process. Further, we want to identify what expertise, and knowledge that are needed in the organization in order to provide and develop professional support. The study also aims at an understanding of how the organization should carry out continued professional development and strategic planning for future recruitments. Method: We are conducting individual semi-structured interviews with selected researchers working in the areas of health sciences and medicine. Preliminary results: The researchers at the Faculty of Medicine are heterogeneous with respect to their publishing practices, information retrieval behavior, use of scientific methods, and approaches for evaluating research. Our results thus far show that there is uncertainty among the researchers with regard to the individual skills of the librarians and the concrete ways in which the library can provide support. A continued professional development program for the librarians is a necessity. (Less)",1969912240; 2605417439; 2605387002,Yvonne Hultman Özek; Carola Tilgmann; Matthias Bank

We develop and test a model that predicts how individual characteristics (tenure, scientific excellence, and perceived compatibility between open science and intellectual property protection) and organizational factors (university royalty policy, departmental patent culture, and TTO professionalism, activeness, and profit drive) affect individual patenting activity (discrete indicator of having a patent and count of university patents). Data from a national survey of 1,457 U.S.-based university scientists, of which 995 are patenters, are used in logistic and zero-inflated negative binomial regression models. Findings from this research generally support our hypotheses that individual and organizational factors are associated with individual patenting activity. This research points to ways in which universities and policy makers can address propensity to patent through application of appropriate incentives and reduction of organizational barriers.",2089393573; 2164900422,Mary K.

Specifically it looks at the use of the Open University’s (OU) OpenScienceLab (OSL) in two remote rural schools in the West Highlands of Scotland. OSL is a series of online experiments openly licensed for anyone to use, they are about learning through experimentation, and are part of a wider OU interest in how to support and develop inquiry based learning at a distance (Scanlon 2012). This area is of particular relevance to Scottish schools, as the underlying pedagogy of Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) promotes interdisciplinary thinking and learning through inquiry (Macintyre 2014).
The idea of the pilot was to work on how “open content” might be used in schools to understand what openness might mean in and for educational practice. While our initial intention was simply to run these in schools after the first workshops it became apparent while the technical and licences were open and it was relatively clear how to do the experiments, people were uncertain how to use them in their educational practice. Emphasising the need to attend to Educational Practice as well as Openness in OEP.

The pilot took a participatory design approach (Sanders and Westerlund 2011; Mor et.al 2012), to developing and support practices around the use of Open Educational Resources (OER) in classroom. Through a series of workshops and schools visits we looked to solve these problems from the classroom out, using the teachers experience to develop learning journeys that worked for teachers and pupils. With teachers we created a learning journey using the OU’s free platform OpenLearnWorks to wrap the experiments in a mixture of existing and newly developed OER.

Two journeys were created, these will be run in two locations with with two sets of teachers in December 2014. The paper will report on the outcomes for pupils and teachers of this final stage. In doing so it will reflect on the participatory design process, highlighting the practices developed to support the use of open content, drawing out broader conclusions might support the use open materials in the classroom.",2101446330; 2461015410; 2465162329,Ronald Macintyre; D.A.

This focuses especially on open access for scholarly publishing. This is a review of literature, describing the evolution of open access, recent trend and its growth and adoption at global level. Findings of this study are the philosophy of open access has tremendously grown in all over the globe since 2002 and the benefits have leaded the researchers to alter their practices of scholarly communication. Even the research funders and institutions have mandated open access for the dissemination of research findings for which they grant financial assistance. Limited literature regarding open access status in Sri Lanka indicates that there is room for improvement. This paper proposes the Sri Lankan scientists, to adopt open access for scholarly communication practices to maximize visibility and to earn high impact for their research. Similarly, funding agencies, universities and research institutions can formulate open access policy, establish institutional repositories, and motivate publishing in open access journals and archiving in digital repositories for future development and research.

The mission of the Office of Science is the delivery of scientific discoveries and major scientific tools to transform our understanding of nature and to advance the energy, economic, and national security of the United States.

The challenge is twofold: to assemble this compound environment and to employ it for execution of a mixture of throughput- and performance-oriented BOTs , with a dozen to millions of tasks each. Our generic mechanism allows per BOT specification of dynamic arbitrary scheduling and replication policies as a function of the system state, BOT execution state, and BOT priority. We implement our mechanism in the GridBot system and demonstrate its capabilities in a production setup. GridBot has executed hundreds of BOTs with over 9 million jobs during three months alone; these have been invoked on 25,000 hosts, 15,000 from the Superlink@Technion community grid and the rest from the Technion campus grid, local clusters, the Open Science Grid, EGEE, and the UW Madison pool.",2035651002; 2251416237; 1982493283; 2135728993,Mark Silberstein; Artyom Sharov; Dan Geiger; Assaf Schuster

Keywords: pedagogy; open educational practice; OER; open science; sharing; reuse It has been argued that it is insufficient simply to share and reuse open educational resources (OER) in an existing teacher-centred, assessment-focused learning environment. Rather, OER should be deployed within pedagogic practices that ‘rely on social interaction, knowledge creation, peer-learning, and shared learning practices’ (Ehlers, 2011: 6). More generally, it has been pointed out that, to bring about an ‘enduring change’ in their approach, teachers need both to think and act differently (Biggs, 2003). In what ways, therefore, should university teachers change in order to support their students’ learning in an open world, and how radical does this change need to be? Are there traces of open practices in their current teaching on which they could build? This paper reports data from an investigation into the relationship between the principles and practices of openness in education and the values and practices espoused by individual academics in a research-intensive university which is also a provider of OER. In so doing, we aimed to build a more critical perspective on open educational practice in higher education and thereby inform future institutional support for these practices more generally. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 14 members of academic staff from a range of disciplines. Interviewees were selected using a purposive sampling method, which identified a) academics who were known (from the author’s previous research) to be already involved in open practices at the university (e.g. contributing to its OER collections or active in open science), and b) academics who were not known to engage in these practices. The latter were identified from staff who had been honoured in a teaching awards scheme run by the university’s Student Union in 2012 and 2013. The interview schedule was based on a conceptual framework of open educational practice constructed following an extended literature review. Starting with the premises that 1) ‘the world’s knowledge is a public good’ (Geser, 2012: 16), and 2) ‘open sharing of knowledge is at the heart of the academic process,’ (Lerman, Miyagawa and Margulies, 2008: 214), we elicited interviewees’ perspectives on sharing and reusing resources; the roles of teacher and student; and developing professional practice through sharing educational knowledge. Interviewees largely agreed with the two premises, but were concerned that the second suggests that education consists solely in sharing knowledge. Altruism and knowledge self-efficacy figured as key factors in their willingness to share OER, which reflects the findings of Van Acker et al. (2013). Interviewees also displayed very low levels of OER reuse, and this echoes the low awareness of copyright issues and lack of pedagogically appropriate materials reported by Masterman and Wild (2011). Interviewees recognised characteristics of ‘open’ pedagogical models – the ‘flattening’ of the teacher-student relationship, students’ responsibility for their own learning, and learning as (or in) a community – in the university’s longstanding model of teaching. However, they felt the teacher necessarily remains the more experienced partner and questioned how far students can achieve conceptual growth in complex areas unaided. The data also suggest that interviewees and their colleagues do share their professional knowledge informally, but the university’s organisational structures and culture are strongly restraining influences. The project also addressed the proposition that open practices in research (open science) might act as a catalyst for open practices in teaching. However, we found little evidence of such cross-fertilisation, in part because active practitioners of open science often have research rather than teaching roles, and in part because of a tendency to compartmentalise one’s research and teaching. Since the study was limited to a single, somewhat unrepresentative, institution its aim remains incomplete. Nevertheless, the data suggest that the issues discussed with our interviewees merit exploration more widely across the sector. Even though their professional values may resonate with those of openness, academics may feel more confident being open in their research activities than in their teaching. Open practices both within and across the fields of teaching and research remain disparate, and the digital scholars (Weller, 2011) who can confidently join them up may still be relatively rare. We thus find ourselves in a situation where teachers may espouse ‘open’ principles but feel held back from putting them into practice. On the positive side, this disposition towards openness, and the points of contact between current and open practice, suggest that moves towards open pedagogic models might not need to be as radical as envisaged by Ehlers (2011) – and, even, that open pedagogies are not as fundamentally different from existing ones as is sometimes claimed.

will result in a low probability of independent studies reaching the same outcome (lack of replicability). After outlining the
challenges facing behavioral ecology and science more broadly and incorporating advice from international organizations such as the
Center for Open Science (COS), we present clear guidelines and tutorials on what we think open practices represent for behavioral
ecologists. In addition, we indicate some of the currently most appropriate and freely available tools for adopting these practices.
Finally, we suggest that all journals in our field, such as Behavioral Ecology, give additional weight to transparent studies and therefore
provide greater incentives to align our scientific practices to our scientific values. Overall, we argue that producing demonstrably

In the present paper, I propose an alternative system for conducting rigorous and replicable psychological investigations, which I describe as Exploring Small, Confirming Big. I begin with a critical evaluation of the merits of NHST and small-scale meta-analyses, and argue that NHST does have a valuable role in the scientific process, whereas small-scale meta-analyses will do little to advance a cumulative science. I then present an overview of an alternative system for producing cumulative and replicable psychological research: Exploring Small, Confirming Big. It involves a two-step process to psychological research, consisting of (1) small N investigation(s), in which psychologists use NHST to develop exploratory models; and (2) strong, confirmatory tests of exploratory models, by analyzing new and/or existing large N datasets with variables that capture the effect(s) of interest from the Exploring Small stage. I conclude by discussing several anticipated benefits and challenges of adopting the Exploring Small, Confirming Big approach.",2586077933,John Kitchener Sakaluk

SHARE is one such initiative and is creating a new access and discovery tool which addresses the need to maximize research impact. Most access and discovery tools stifle innovation by keeping information about research behind paywalls or in environments that discourage reuse. SHARE is developing SHARE Notify, an open access and discovery tool that is free and encourages use, reuse, and repurposing. SHARE Notify is a dataset of metadata about research events such as articles, datasets, presentations, grant awards, etc. This poster addresses the purpose of SHARE and the development SHARE Notify.

Methods: SHARE is funded by Sloan and IMLS; led by ARL and COS; and co-sponsored by the AAU and APLU. SHARE Notify is being developed collaboratively by participants representing libraries, repositories, university administrations, publishers, and non-profit organizations.

Results: In 2015, SHARE released a beta version of SHARE Notify (https://osf.io/share/?). SHARE Notify harvests metadata from more than 100 content providers including data, institutional, and disciplinary repositories and databases such as CrossRef and PubMed Central. SHARE Notify’s code is freely available on the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/t3j94/). Anyone is free to participate in and build upon SHARE Notify.

During Phase Two (2015-2017) SHARE is enhancing the SHARE Notify dataset by harvesting from more sources, adding more identifiers, working with similar international initiatives on interoperability, and promoting SHARE.

Conclusions: SHARE welcomes your involvement in ensuring that SHARE Notify reaches its full potential.",2332370658,Linda Plunket

He had an orthodox Jewish upbringing in a lively immigrant community in the East End of London. Music was a familiar part of daily life and he became an extremely competent pianist, while his brother Edward became a musicologist and authority on Debussy. He was educated at the Grocers’ School, Hackney, and from there won an Open Science Scholarship to Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (his school proclaimed a public holiday to celebrate this). He read the Natural Sciences Tripos Part I, gaining a first, followed by the Mechanical Sciences Tripos in 1913. After a short period of study at the Royal School of Mines he enlisted with the RAMC in 1914 and was landed at Gallipoli. He maintained he survived only because he was invalided out of the peninsula with dysentery. He then worked for a time in Egypt on a treatment for this disease.",2340040415,A. P. J. Edwards

To achieve the propositions, we studied the new technological and political structures that influence the modes of production and circulation of scientific knowledge. The political environment presented the struggles for more democratic societies, based on a culture of openness, including openness of scientific knowledge produced with public funding. We examined various world documents about Open Access, Open Science, mandatory policies, laws, reports, recommendations, as well as open access initiatives in operation. Finally, we applied the knowledge accumulated in the proposition of an Open Science Platform to Brazil, which is divided into two parts. The first discusses a Political Platform beginning with a mandatory policy, the progression and promotion policy in scientific career in the environment of the Open Science, preservation policy for digital and open documents, standardization of multimodal scientific papers and standards of interoperability. The second part brings the design for a national infrastructure platform for Open Science, including open publications, virtual laboratory, collaborative work, data cloud, peer network, evidence for electronic curriculum, generation of national indicators and reports.",2680152264,Viviane Toraci Alonso de Andrade

Open science and collaborative R&D may help [1]–[3]. Open science has been described as “a research accelerator” [4]. Open science implies open access [5] but goes beyond it: “Imagine a connected online web of scientific knowledge that integrates and connects data, computer code, chains of scientific reasoning, descriptions of open problems, and beyond …. tightly integrated with a scientific social web that directs scientists' attention where it is most valuable, releasing enormous collaborative potential.” [1].

Open science and collaborative approaches are often described as open source, by analogy with open-source software such as the operating system Linux which powers Google and Amazon—collaboratively created software which is free to use and adapt, and popular for Internet infrastructure and scientific research [6], [7]. However, this use of “open source” is unclear. Some people use “open source” when a project's results are free to use, others when a project's process is highly collaborative [4].

It is clearer to classify open source and open science within a broader class of collaborative R&D, which can be defined as scalable collaboration (usually enabled by information technology) across organizational boundaries to solve R&D challenges [8].

Many approaches to open science and collaborative R&D have been tried [1], [9]. The Gene Wiki has created over 10,000 Wikipedia articles, and aims to provide one for every notable human gene [10]. The crowdsourcing platform InnoCentive has reportedly facilitated solutions to roughly half of the thousands of technical problems posed on the site, including many in life sciences such as the $1 million ALS Biomarker Prize [11]. Other examples include prizes (X-Prize [12]), scientific games (FoldIt [13]), and licensing schemes inspired by open-source software (BIOS [14]).

Collaborative R&D approaches vary in openness [15]. In some approaches, the R&D process and outputs are open to all—for example, open-science projects like the Gene Wiki described above. In other approaches which demonstrate what might be called controlled collaboration, there are strong controls on who contributes and benefits—for example, computational platforms like Collaborative Drug Discovery or InnoCentive that support both commercial and nonprofit research [9], [11].

Collaborative approaches can unleash innovation from unforeseen sources, as with crowdsourcing health technologies [11]–[13], [16]. They may help in global challenges like drug development [17], as with India's OSDD (Open Source Drug Discovery) project that recruited over 7,000 volunteers [16] and an open-source drug synthesis project that improved an existing drug without increasing its cost [18].

If you want to apply open science and collaborative R&D, what principles are useful? We suggest Ten Simple Rules for Cultivating Open Science and Collaborative R&D. We also offer eight conversational interviews exploring life experiences that led to these rules (Box 1).


Box 1. Conversations on Open Science and Collaborative R&D
Many commentators have considered challenges in translating open science and collaborative methods to biomedical research [2]–[4], [9], [17], [20], [24], [26], [28], [29]. How can protecting intellectual property be balanced with freeing researchers to build on previous knowledge? If R&D results are collaboratively created and freely available, who will take responsibility for costly clinical trials and quality control? What will be the Linux of open-source R&D?

To explore such challenges and convey life experiences in biomedical open science and collaborative R&D, we offer eight conversational interviews by the first author of this article as supplementary material.

However, the licensee may access and exploit this latent knowledge by engaging the inventor during the development phase. This paper examines the hypothesis that licensing strategies that directly engage the inventor increase the likelihood and degree of commercialization success. While this may seem somewhat apparent, firms in the sample under investigation vary substantially in the degree to which they engage the inventor: one third of the sample does not engage the inventor at all. On the other hand, the hypothesis might seem surprising given the norms of open science under which university labs are expected to operate. Regression analyses based on a unique dataset of 124 license agreements associated with inventions from MIT support the hypothesis and generate results that are robust to a variety of controls.",2175326110,Ajay K.

Policy mandates for data sharing have contributed to the increasing availability of research data through data repositories, which create favourable conditions for the re-use of data for purposes not always anticipated by original collectors. Despite the current efforts to promote transparency and reproducibility in science, data re-use cannot be assumed, nor merely considered a ‘thrifting’ activity where scientists shop around in data repositories considering only the ease of access to data. The lack of an integrated view of individual, social and technological influential factors to intentional and actual data re-use behaviour was the key motivator for this study. Interviews with 13 social scientists produced 25 factors that were found to influence their perceptions and experiences, including both their unsuccessful and successful attempts to re-use data. These factors were grouped into six theoretical variables: perceived benefits, perceived risks, perceived effort, social influence, facilitating conditions, and perceived re-usability. These research findings provide an in-depth understanding about the re-use of research data in the context of open science, which can be valuable in terms of theory and practice to help leverage data re-use and make publicly available data more actionable .",2267303335,Renata Gonçalves Curty

In this paper, we argue that this “one-size-fits-all” view of openness sidesteps key questions about the forms, implications, and goals of openness for research practice. We propose instead to interpret openness as a dynamic and highly situated mode of valuing the research process and its outputs, which encompasses economic as well as scientific, cultural, political, ethical, and social considerations. This interpretation creates a critical space for moving beyond the economic definitions of value embedded in the contemporary biosciences landscape and Open Science policies, and examining the diversity of interests and commitments that affect research practices in the life sciences. To illustrate these claims, we use three case studies that...",2126828419; 2277750656,Nadine Levin; Sabina Leonelli

In order to show that, we adopt a Schumpeterian growth model where the resources allocated to science are endogenously determined within the economy and science is organised according to the institution of “Open Science”. This latter consists in a self-reinforcing code of conduct, which comprises an incentive scheme based on the priority rule, and on the presence of both real rewards and social rewards. Social rewards take two main forms according to the source concerned: one is the social reward deriving from major innovations; another consists in high reputation enjoyed by researchers who put a high level of effort into their job, and devote themselves to the advancement of science. This set of rules causes the emergence of two locally stable steady-states: a low equilibrium, where the economy is endowed with a small science sector; and a high equilibrium, where the economy has a large science sector with rapid knowledge advancement. The two equilibria can account for the huge differences currently existing between scientific sectors of more developed and less developed countries. Comparative static results further characterise the two equilibria, since monetary and social rewards have different effects according to the type of equilibrium that emerges.",1974829317; 2027242796,Maria Rosaria Carillo; Erasmo Papagni

A brief background to the iSchool movement is given followed by a brief review of the data decade, which highlights key data trends from the iSchool perspective: open data and open science, big data and disciplinary data diversity. The growing emphasis on the shortage of data talent is noted and a family of data science roles identified. The paper moves on to describe three primary functions of iSchools: education, research intelligence and professional practice, which form the foundations of a new Capability Ramp Model. The model is illustrated by mini-case studies from the School of Information Sciences, University of Pittsburgh: the immersive (laboratory-based) component of two new Research Data Management and Research Data Infrastructures graduate courses, a new practice partnership with the University Library System centred on RDM, and the mapping of disciplinary data practice using the Community Capability Model Profile Tool. The paper closes with a look to the future and, based on the assertion that data is mission-critical for iSchools, some steps are proposed for the next data decade: moving data education programs into the mainstream core curriculum, adopting a translational data science perspective and strengthening engagement with the Research Data Alliance.",2194336525; 2236586591,Liz Lyon; Aaron L.

Doi.: 10.7818/ECOS.2016.25-2.11 Most scientific papers are not reproducible: it is really hard, if not impossible, to understand how results are derived from data, and being able to regenerate them in the future (even by the same researchers). However, traceability and reproducibility of results are indispensable elements of high-quality science, and an increasing requirement of many journals and funding sources. Reproducible studies include code able to regenerate results from the original data. This practice not only provides a perfect record of the whole analysis but also reduces the probability of errors and facilitates code reuse, thus accelerating scientific progress. But doing reproducible science also brings many benefits to the individual researcher, including saving time and effort, improved collaborations, and higher quality and impact of final publications. In this article we introduce reproducible science, why it is important, and how we can improve the reproducibility of our work. We introduce principles and tools for data management, analysis, version control, and software management that help us achieve reproducible workflows in the context of ecology.",2014366604; 2395966784; 140698343; 2200771965,Francisco Rodríguez-Sánchez; Antonio J.

In this trend of academic commercialization, a growing concern has been expressed that its potential incompatibility with the traditional norms of open science could undermine the cooperative climate in academia. Drawing on the framework of evolution of the cooperation, this study examines the changing nature of academic cooperation under the current policy trend. In an ideal state of open science, academics are supposed to cooperate gratis and unconditionally. However, results predict that the commercialized regime could compromise underlying mechanisms of cooperation and allow defectors to prevail. As the trend further grows, academics would become more demanding of direct reward in exchange for cooperation, and they would refrain from engaging in cooperation but would prefer to work independently. Some interventions (e.g., centralized rewarding) could mitigate the problem but require delicate system design.",2162300226,Sotaro Shibayama

We did a literature review on peer-reviewed papers, websites of funding agency, open science blogs, and threads on Twitter. We believe the values of research output are not limited to a paper in a high reputation journal. Data is now considered as separate output, as well as, data management protocols, and laboratory notebooks. Publishing research results as a preprint is also used to disseminate findings as rapid and as fast as possible. Post publication peer-review is also added to the reviewing system to add openness, transparency, and objectivity. It offers credit to the reviewers. We also see the growth of impact indicators as the results of San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) statutory. More initiatives and technologies have been introduced to make science more open, transparent, and inclusive. With so many developments have been made, therefore it’s not wise for Indonesian academia to rely themselves only to the old perception of research outputs and impact indicators.",2134276401; 2216271364; 2738343675; 2234732162; 2736636157; 2097469126; 2738549605; 2737667953; 2678997122; 2738553684; 2736579496,Dasapta Erwin Irawan; Defny Holidin; Nurhazman Abdul Aziz; Cut Novianti Rachmi; Hendy Irawan; Juneman Abraham; Kustiati Kusno; Mochammad Tanzil Multazam; Keukeu Kaniawati Rosada; Septriono Hari Nugroho; Galih Kusumah

After several failed attempts at email-parser based ticket exchanges, the OSG Operations Group has designed a comprehensive ticket synchronizing application. The GOC-TX application uses web-service interfaces offered by various commercial, open source and other homegrown ticketing systems, to synchronize tickets between two or more of these systems. GOC-TX operates independently from any ticketing system. It can be triggered by one ticketing system via email, active messaging, or a web-services call to check for current sync-status, pull applicable recent updates since prior synchronizations to the source ticket, and apply the updates to a destination ticket. The currently deployed production version of GOC-TX is able to synchronize tickets between the Numara Footprints ticketing system used by the OSG and the following systems: European Grid Initiative's system Global Grid User Support (GGUS) and the Request Tracker (RT) system used by Brookhaven. Additional interfaces to the BMC Remedy system used by Fermilab, and to other instances of RT used by other OSG partners, are expected to be completed in summer 2010.

At the same time, there have been a number of calls for research in the digital realm to foster 'openness', for example in 'open access' policies. This paper explores the relation between e-infrastructures and open science, and argues that there are a number of factors apart from research policy that will shape e-research. These include not only the legal and economic environment, but also the ethos of science, 'open' initiatives outside of research, the momentum of large technological systems, and the activism of experts and wider social movements. The paper assesses the strengths and weaknesses of these factors, as well as the tensions and confluences between openness and e-infrastructures.",2115686201,Ralph Schroeder

Much has been written about open access publishing, open peer review, open source software, open education, open science, and open government. In this diverse, expansive body of work, reference has been made to academic books and articles, policy documents, reports, newspaper and magazine items, and a variety of web-based sources. Most of the materials on which discourses of openness have been based have been non-fictional. There is value, however, when contemplating the meaning of openness, its limits and its educational significance, in also turning to other forms of writing. Among the alternatives is imaginative literature, and of the novels that might be considered when addressing the idea of openness, particularly as this applies to knowledge communities, none is more helpful than Hermann Hesse’s The Glass Bead Game (Hesse, 2000). The Glass Bead Game, first published in 1943, was the crowning achievement of Hesse’s long writing career and earned him the Nobel Prize for literature in 1946. The book has a three-part structure.

Describing the early efforts of organizing mountain science through programs such as UNESCO MAB and UNEP at the global scale, this chapter focuses on the recent history of research coordination for the European mountains, in particular on the activities of the Carpathian Convention and the European Program of the Mountain Research Initiative, which were among main driving factors for the initiation of the Science for the Carpathians (S4C) network. This regional mountain research network was established in 2008 to foster scientific collaboration and communication and to promote applied research and capacity building, which in turn would support sustainable development in the Carpathian Mountains.

An attempt was made to por- tray the key definitions and types of the open access. Detailed rules of Open Access to scientific journals were presented, i.e. the provision of comprehensive issues and partial resources of texts with the technical benchmarks necessary for the functioning of the journal in accordance with the principles of the Berlin Declaration. Two strategies are presented in the paper: (1) green, based on institutional data bases (libraries and/or digital archives), and (2) gold, referring to full open peer-reviewed journals, with the indication of channels and tools of scientific communication. Models of Open Science licences are also presented, related to the principles of Open Access, i.e. open standards and open li- cences. The admissible by the current legislation licences for individual articles are also presented, based on the principles of Creative Commons, along with the citation rules of the components of open scientific journals. For example, the Przestrzen Spoleczna/Social Space journal includes a procedure of the creation of an open journal, along with possible ways of financing of this type of publication. The presentation is concluded with the main determinants of Open Access and the perspective of the ex- istence of open content in the Internet now and in the future, using meta-search engines and meta- aggregators of the scientific content.",2478530544; 2776627524,Jarosław Kinal; Zbigniew Rykiel

In January 2013 the Swedish Government commissioned the Swedish Research Council to develop a proposal for national guidelines for open access to scientific information, in collaboration with the National Library of Sweden. Comments from different stakeholders were collected through meetings, dialogues as well as an open web forum during 2013 and 2014. Many of the views expressed were utilized in the final document. The final proposal, which includes guidelines for both scientific publications, artistic works and research data, was submitted to the Government in January 2015. Also, the proposal contains recommendations on what needs to be further investigated and solved, in order to enable the fulfillment of the strategic objectives for 2025, when all scientific publications and artistic works resulting from research financed with public funds shall be published immediately with open access. In December 2015 the Swedish Government invited approximately 100 representatives from HEIs, funders, research and library organizations as well as researchers to a national hearing. The aim was to discuss how Sweden and the government can proceed with the transformation to an open access publishing system. During the hearing it was emphasized that the transformation to an open access publishing system in many respects is connected to the existing qualification and funding allocation system. Therefore there is a need for strong incentives for researchers to publish open access. Also, there is a national and international need to get control of both subscription fees and APCs in order to facilitate the transition to an open access publication system. At the end of 2016 the Government is expected to address the national guidelines in the Budget bill, the Research Bill as well as in different appropriation directives to national HEI’s and funders. Also, the Minister for Research and Higher Education has expressed the will to notify a national coordination task to the National Library of Sweden regarding open access to scientific publications and artistic works and a parallel coordination task to the Swedish Research Council regarding open access to research data. The Swedish Government supports the European Council Conclusions on the transition towards and Open Science System. Our proposed presentation aims to give a state of the art report of the current development, both from a national perspective and from an institutional perspective. How are we are preparing to implement the guidelines? What strategies are institutions and libraries using, both with regard to publishers and researchers? We hope to inspire a discussion and exchange of experiences, since several countries now are in a similar process.",2538807165; 2532799789,Beate Eellend; Jonas Gilbert

Lessons learned from the analysis of law as applied to the Internet may illuminate the issues that will arise in such collaborations. Although the ideal of open science pushes scientists toward communal ownership of scientific results, increasingly the ownership and control of research results in such collaborations will be effected by a variety of intellectual property regimes. Patent, copyright, trade secrecy, and trademark law all potentially have a bearing on the results of collaborative research. Additionally, because such laws vary by jurisdiction, the legal result of transborder electronic collaboration may prove particularly complex. Regimes of licensing and of technological content protection may be applied to address some of this complexity, but offer their own complications.",2169840793,Dan L. Burk

We need to embrace science as a process- driven human endeavour to better understand the world around us. Products are important, but through better transparency, we can leverage ideas, good and bad, ours and others, to do better science. In a brief analysis here inspired by a recent discussion of the topic and previous introspections by other ecologists, it is proposed that whilst it is a good idea to track ideas and all the processes that generate outcomes such as publications, there is inherent merit in all scientific ideas. That said, organizing and framing our ideas into the networks that we already use to examine hypotheses and questions in science is a window into our workflows including ideation, implementation, data analyses, and how we can better map ideas into open science outcomes. Formalizing and describing the linkages between ideas, data, and projects we produce as scientists will enhance and diversify the value of the work we do individually and collectively.",2179308422,Christopher J.

Prior to 1989, the Slovak Academy of Sciences was the state mandated coordinator of science and technology in Slovakia and was funded directly by the state budget. Since 1990, the Academy has had to share many of its prerogatives with other authorities and institutions, as in the case of the universities in regard to doctoral programmes, or to cede them out‐right, as in the case of the Ministry of Education and Science in regard to the coordination of basic research. Its budget has been drastically cut. It has also had to contend with the introduction of a western type of grant programme and system of evaluation for its subordinate institutes, some of which have been closed. In short, the Slovak Academy of Sciences must compete in an increasingly open science market in which it must give proof both of the quality of its work and of the relevance of the latter t...",2576342498,S.

In other words, by taking existing empirical literature into account, it is intended that a crucial question is answered: Is secrecy and withholding in research harmful or innocuous to science? To understand how secrecy and withholding in research have affected academic science, empirical studies have been placed in the wider context of Mertonian underpinnings of the anticommons threat. The turning point in testing the effects of secrecy and withholding of data and material on scientific research was marked by statistical studies based on surveys and bibliometric measures. These two types of empirical studies have given answers to the basic question since academia was threatened by different modes of practicing science",2603153390,Victor Rodriguez

Its convenient geopolitical position, as well as its indented coast contributed to its imposition as an important cultural and political center of Dalmatia throughout the rich history of Croatia. Its university tradition is centuries-old and begins with ecclesiastical education first mentioned in 10th century. In 2002, the University of Zadar was founded and a base of contemporary University is faculty of Philosophy, Teaching College, as well as Dominican university. Due to its geographical position on the crossroads of Western and Eastern Europe, Croatian had a significant role in European history and culture, with a strong influences of Latin as well as Byzantine cultures. The corpus of Croatian Mediaeval literature is therefore written on three scripts – Glagolitic, Latin and Bosnian variant of Cyrillic scripts, called bosanica , and in three languages – Church Slavonic, Croatian redaction of the Church Slavonic language and Latin (Hercigonja, 1999, 2009). Although Glagolitic script was in use in several other countries, it is only in Croatia that it took angular form, used also for the first Croatian printed books, as early as in 1483. The most important Mediaeval written heritage in Croatia is written on Glagolitic and Latin scripts, and an important part of that corpus is nowadays part of collections of heritage institutions in Zadar. In accordance with current interdisciplinary trends in cataloguing, research and communication of cultural heritage in digital age, the interdisciplinary scientific project Digitization, bibliographic description and research of texts written on Glagolitic, Croatian Cyrillic and Latin scripts until the end of 19 th century in Zadar and Sibenik area is being carried out at the University of Zadar in co-operation with Vestigia Manuscript Research Centre of University of Graz, Austria. The goals of the project are: (1) digitization of old and rare books written on Glagolitic, Croatian Cyrillic and Latin scripts, primarily manuscripts (2) Machine readable cataloguing based on existing printed catalogues, making of inventory lists, registration and inclusion of Croatian manuscript and early print, primarily Glagolitic, collections in Croatian and European portals of written heritage. This goal includes the research in the field of information sciences, by focusing on research of standardization of bibliographic description of manuscripts and early prints and their digitization, and in the fields of digital humanities and humanities user needs. In order to achieve this goal, the project connects also to national project Production, publishing and maintaining national cataloguing rules: 2014-2016 . This goal became the major goal, as research in semantic web, linked open data and other standards of publication of data, as well as research data are conducted here. FRBR-LRM, CIDOC-CRM and other conceptual models, as well as machine-readable formats are being mapped and researched together with standards for description of manuscripts in different communities, in order to achieve appropriate metadata scheme for the description of manuscripts coming from different institutions. (Varniene-Janssen, Juskys, 2013) (3) Gathering scientists from various scientific fields, especially humanities, interested in research of Croatian written heritage in digital environment, to enable their research of written heritage, to research their needs and to create proper conditions for their research, to digitize the material of their interest, as well as to implement and develop tools for manuscript research in digital environment (tools for transliteration and transcription, visual tagging, etc.) (Holm, Jarrick, Scott, 20015) Some tools are designed specially for palaeographic research of Glagolitic material and will be tested on the project (visual tagging of digitized pictures of Glagolitic and Cyrillic manuscripts) as well as tools for visualization of research data on manuscripts and collections (Essert, et al.); (4) communication of the heritage is an important part of a project, respectively presenting heritage in a contemporary creative and innovative manner to various groups of users, using information technology, web portal, virtual exhibitions, presentations, mapping locations on touristic and other geographic maps as well as in the wider touristic offer. In this goal, inclusion of public is planned, particularly of associations of citizens interested in Glagolitic heritage, the most important segment of Croatian written heritage, following the EU recommendations connected with open science, citizen engagement and citizen researchers in the age of digital culture. As the project supports educational activities at university, it involves students in each project phase and enables conditions for laboratory and field education. In order to achieve those goals, several working groups are formed and workflow with indicated activities and methodology for the activities of each group are designed, and will be presented in this presentation, together with the assumptions for cross-institutional cooperation in the field of digital humanities will be listed on the example of Zadar University and main research goals and expected results will be presented.

Implementation as a Python module offers great flexibility due to the wide range of scientific Python modules that can be used without having to transform the basis data types. SAMT2 can be used as part of a Python script even in parallel processing at the computer cluster for large simulations. Its graphical user interface is similar to that of SAMT, but it is easier to adapt and enhance. In addition, SAMT2 can be used together with IPython notebook to combine the readable source code, documentation, and visualization to a new style, called Open Science, to include stakeholders in modeling. The paper focuses on the new graphical user interface based on QT and the implementation of SAMT2.",2198489058; 2103528305; 2555432992; 2283125820,Ralf Wieland; Karin Groth; Felix Linde; Wilfried Mirschel

Open Science began as a way to facilitate the workings of multi-site and multi-national research collaborations but practitioners may choose to adopt it as much for philosophical as for pragmatic reasons. Conducting research as ‘open science’ has implications for research practice, peer-review, trust and reputation, publishing and access. 
Open Science projects exist through and depend on the Internet; therefore they are accessible to audiences – including public audiences – beyond the research groups that generate their content. Thus Open Science offers both a novel medium for direct, unmediated access to the process of science and an innovative method for scientists to communicate about their work live, unedited and in real-time. 
Does Open Science clear the stream of communication through direct access or muddy the waters with unfocussed, unclear and unvetted comment? This paper will discuss recent analysis of data derived from interviews and case-studies to probe these issues more fully. The analysis suggests that adopting an Open Science approach will allow the capturing of an authentic and clear record of research and increase and improve access to research outputs. However, researchers acknowledge that this involves opening themselves and their work up to a different quality of scrutiny. For researchers, Open Science both enhances the development of collaboration and communication among research groups and is a way for publicly-funded researchers to meet their responsibilities to communicate with the wider public.

Authors submitting their research to either BMC Ecology or BMC Evolutionary Biology will now have the opportunity to deposit their data directly into the Dryad archive and will receive a permanent, citable link to their dataset. Although this does not affect any of our current data deposition policies at these journals, we hope to encourage a more widespread adoption of open data sharing in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology by facilitating this process for our authors. We also take this opportunity to discuss some of the wider issues that may concern researchers when making their data openly available. Although we offer a number of positive examples from different fields of biology, we also recognise that reticence to data sharing still exists, and that change must be driven from within research communities in order to create future science that is fit for purpose in the digital age.",705885879; 2114464965; 2267980870,Amye Kenall; Simon Harold; Christopher Foote

This tension is particularly palpable in the area of publicly‑funded research, the socio‑economic utility of which must be proven by applying performance indicators, encouraging researchers to legally protect their scientific findings and establish the financial value of their research. Accordingly, the traditional “open science” ethic must accommodate economic performance requirements. Rather than pitting one against the other, we set out to show how both sides of the equation could become integral parts of balanced Intellectual Property strategies, provided that the definition of public‑sector performance is not restricted to overly narrow objectives. Caution must be exercised here to avoid a situation in which the ethics of researchers provide a final yet fragile safeguard against possible misuse resulting from inadequate oversight mechanisms.",2627922812; 2000265275; 2339169467,Hervé Chomienne; Pascal Corbel; Jean-Philippe Denis

One such value is openness. Given the important role of science in political, economic, social and technological development, it is important to identify the legal and policy reforms required to promote open science. Besides analysing the benefits of open science, it is also important to analyse the challenges in practising open science, particularly in the global south. In the context of one the countries in the global south, i.e. India, this paper analyses how approaches towards intellectual property rights (IPRs) can be fine-tuned for fostering open science. This paper begins with an introduction that contextualises the discussion. Section II of this paper examines in detail the current crisis in science. Section III introduces how open science emerged as a movement to counter this crisis. It also discusses the diverse benefits and challenges of practising open science. Section IV analyses the implications of open science for the global south. In this section, we also map the evolution of the open movements in India. In Section V, we discuss how the approaches towards IPRs could be modified to foster the open science movement in India. The article concludes by highlighting some areas for future research.",1925668788; 2602856037,Arul George Scaria; Rishika Rangarajan

It presents the results of a survey on 280 French academic inventors, that is, French university professors who are also designated as inventors in at least one European patent. This survey provides new insights into the effect of university patenting on the commercialization of university inventions, the transfer of scientific research, the incentives to do basic research and the access to upstream knowledge. In particular, the study suggests that patenting university research can, on the one hand, facilitate the transfer of technology from university to industry, especially in the fields of life sciences and pharmaceuticals. On the other hand, it almost systematically delays the publication of research findings, thus hindering the dissemination of scientific knowledge.",2125751403,Julien Pénin

While empirical research suggests that scientists exhibit a ""taste for science,"" such open disclosures can limit a firm's competitive advantage or ability to profitably commercialize their innovations. To explore how this tension is resolved we focus on the strategic interaction between researchers and firms bargaining over whether (and how) knowledge will be disclosed. We evaluate four disclosure strategies: secrecy, patenting, open science (scientific publication) and patent-paper pairs providing insights into the determinants of the disclosure strategy of a firm. We find that patents and publications can be complementary instruments facilitating the disclosure of knowledge-providing predictions as to when stronger IP protection regimes might drive openness by firms.",1616892977; 2614127802; 2185602207,Joshua S.

Digital technologies add a new dimension to collaborative writing by providing co-authors with access to the same document and enabling co-authors to edit the shared text at the same time. The availability of web-based tools for collaborative writing prompts the question of the extent to which researchers incorporate these tools into their scholarly practices. Based on my statistical analysis of the data from the Science 2.0 Survey (2014), conducted in cooperation with the Leibniz Research Alliance Science 2.0, I examine the usage of digital technologies in the process of collaborative writing among researchers in Germany. I use the concepts of asynchronous and synchronous modes of writing, derived from the field of Computer Supported Cooperative Work, to discuss collaborative writing strategies in the context of Science 2.0. My study shows that researchers use a mixture of different writing strategies and that they tend to use the same tool for different writing strategies. Moreover, I discuss researchers' attitudes towards online text editors. In reflecting on collaborative writing, I consider both the technological and social aspects.",2653942535,Kaja Scheliga

Planning of support services with themes of open access scholarly publishing, open research data and open study material began at full throttle at the UEF Library in November 2015. Information specialists were grouped into teams, which orientated to separate aspects of open science and shared their knowledge by training the whole library staff. Teamwork continued actively over the year 2016. Open science continuously brings new tasks for the Library and has already notably changed the job profiles of the library specialists. Advancing open science has been considered highly important not only at the library but also at the university level. UEF has offered resources e.g. by recruiting new information specialists and a data protection officer and internal auditor. UEF Library has a vital role in conducting open science but it is practiced in close collaboration with University Services, especially that of Development Services, General Administration and Legal Services and IT Services. Open Science team has landed the departments to share information and to discuss about open science practices at UEF. Nowadays these roadshows concerning UEF publishing and data policy, open access (OA) publishing as well as research data management and sharing are our focal operation. Work continues but the results can already be seen: In the OA ranking of research organisations in Finland (Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland), UEF has achieved level four in the five-level maturity model. Also, UEF researchers can order tailored training sessions about open research and support services from the diverse training menu offered by the Library. Updated Open UEF web pages are available for everyone and multi-channeled informing directed to UEF staff and students continues online. One concrete output from conducted open science and active campaigning about self-archiving is UEF institutional publication repository, UEF//eRepository, which was launched in February 2017. At the moment about 31% of UEF scientific publications are open access, but substantial increase is expected. The next big challenge in open research is data management and opening. UEF Library is starting to build a metadata portal for research data in order to conceive the data produced by UEF researchers and to help finding data for potential reuse. Open science will also be included in information retrieval studies of master's degree and doctoral students. To encourage students and teachers in OA publishing, during the international open access week, one student publishing master's thesis openly will be rewarded with a stipend by the Library. Department having the highest rate of OA master's theses will also be adorned with flowers. Open science is a matter of teamwork, committing and keeping up to date.",2512704233; 2768495185,Kaisa Hartikainen; Tuula Rissanen

We scrutinize these researchers' (1) statistical concern that heightened stringency with respect to false-positives will increase false-negatives and (2) meta-scientific concern that larger samples and executing direct replications engender opportunity costs that will decrease the rate of making novel discoveries. We argue their statistical concern is unwarranted given open science proponents recommend such practices to reduce the inflated Type I error rate from .35 down to .05 and simultaneously call for high-powered research to reduce the inflated Type II error rate. Regarding their meta-concern, we demonstrate that incurring some costs is required to increase the rate (and frequency) of making true discoveries because distinguishing true from false hypotheses requires a low Type I error rate, high statistical power, and independent direct replications. We also examine pragmatic concerns raised regarding adopting open science practices for relationship science (pre-registration, open materials, open data, direct replications, sample size); while acknowledging these concerns, we argue they are overstated given available solutions. We conclude benefits of open science practices outweigh costs for both individual researchers and the collective field in the long run, but that short term costs may exist for researchers because of the currently dysfunctional academic incentive structure. Our analysis implies our field's incentive structure needs to change whereby better alignment exists between researcher's career interests and the field's cumulative progress. We delineate recent proposals aimed at such incentive structure re-alignment.",2022178797; 2138657055; 2039053016,Etienne P. LeBel; Lorne Campbell; Timothy J. Loving

Such a new 'tragedy of the commons' would bring adverse long-run consequences for future welfare gains through technological progress, and re-distributional effects further disadvantaging the present economically less advanced countries of the world. Radical legal innovations in intellectual property protection that seriously jeopardize the effective conduct of open, collaborative science have been introduced by the little noticed European Database Directive of March 1996. This initiative forms an emblematic and substantively significant aspect of the broader set of transformations in intellectual property rights institutions that have been initiated in response to the economic ramifications of rapid progress in digital information technologies. The EC Directive poses numerous contentious issues in law and economics that will create ambiguities for business and non-profit activities in this area for years to come. The terms on which those issues are resolved will materially affect the costs and organizational feasibility of scientific projects that are of global reach and importance, especially those that depend heavily upon the collection, management and analysis of large volumes of observational data that cannot be regenerated. This paper sets out the economic case for the effectiveness of open, collaborative research, and the forces behind the recent, countervailing rush to strengthen and expand the scope of intellectual property rights protection. Focusing upon innovations in copyright law and the sui generis protection of hitherto unprotected content, it documents the genesis and analyzes the economic implications of the EC's Database Directive, and related legislative proposals (H.R. 3125, H.R. 354 and H.R. 1858) in the US. Several modest remedial proposals are advanced to mitigate the adverse impact of 'the digital technology boomerang' upon open science.",2584665884,Paul A. David

Smaldino and Richard McElreath (in Source) in the Royal Society Open Science journal. In this publication, Smaldino and McElreath indicate that poor research design and evidence data analysis are frequent issues found in current publications, encouraging false-positive findings. The authors think the reason why poor methods persist are (i) from incentives that favour them or/and (ii) from something more than just misunderstanding, once perennial calls for improvement are taken. In fact, this is leading to the natural selection of bad science, according to the authors. In another critical point, Smaldino and McElreath also show evidence that once publication is a principal factor for career advancement; some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. The understanding of this “dynamic system” requires no conscious strategizing by scientists, according to the authors. In fact, in an environment in which one must publish, independent on the quality or the significance, to advance in the career and not perish, one does not care about false-positive findings (we can find exceptions, of course). They prove/provide evidence their point of view with empirical basis (you can check in the Source) and conclude that the improvement of the quality of research requires change at the institutional level. The authors are finally emphatic in pointing out that to improve the culture of science, a great/significant shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. So, (almost) all of us can fail in finding the best way for science.",2609276308,Leonardo Bianco de Carvalho

The findings of the project were published in December 2014 and the main points are summarised here. We found that scientists are motivated in their work to find out more about the world and to benefit society, and that they believe collaboration, multidisciplinarity, openness and creativity are important for the production of high quality science. However, in some cases, our findings suggest, the culture of research in higher education institutions does not support or encourage these goals or activities. For example, high levels of competition and perceptions about how scientists are assessed for jobs and funding are reportedly contributing to a loss of creativity in science, less collaboration and poor research practices. The project led to suggestions for action for funding bodies, research institutions, publishers and editors, professional bodies and individual researchers.",2609682430; 1563169504,Catherine Joynson; Ottoline Leyser

This paper argues that to manage the transition to the Open Access (OA) model of scholarly publishing we need to understand better what enables, encourages and inhibits the adoption of OA publishing among scientists, and to appreciate individual differences within disciplines. The study adopts a psychological perspective to elucidate motivations, capabilities and opportunities for OA publishing among bio-scientists in the UK. To identify individual differences within the discipline we interview bio-scientists with starkly different past practices for disclosing research data and technologies. Content analysis of the interview data reveals that the sampled bio-scientists face similar obstacles and enablers in their physical environment, but that their motivations and experience of their social environments differ. One group is strongly motivated to adopt OA publishing - mainly by their moral convictions and beliefs that OA benefits themselves, other scientists and society - and feels peer pressure related to OA. The other group expresses fewer pro-OA beliefs, holds beliefs that are demotivating towards adoption of OA publishing, but feels pressure from research funders to adopt this form of publishing. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the former group makes more frequent use of OA publishing compared to the latter group, which suggests that only those with strong motivations will work to overcome the obstacles in their social and physical environments. The individual differences within the discipline suggest that bio-scientists are unlikely to respond to OA policies in the same way and, thus, we question the appropriateness of one-size-fits-all OA policies. We show that psychological analyses of scientists’ behaviour can inform the design of more targeted policies and organisational interventions aimed at steering a transition to the OA model of academic publishing.",2006344292; 2126828419; 2277750656; 2425603729; 2431595211,Dagmara Weckowska; Nadine Levin; Sabina Leonelli; John Dupré; David Castle

In the three years since the launch of Genome Medicine, we have seen discussion panels at genomics conferences tackling such topics as return of research results to participants and physician education in the genomic era, while headlines have been made by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act [1], the Myriad Genetics patent litigation [2], and the US Food and Drug Administration's take on direct-to-consumer testing[3].

Considerations of the ethical implications of genomic technologies and data are crucial to the implementation of genomic advances for improving human health. Work in the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) field does not always fit the standard Research article format, but broad, transparent access to these analyses and discussions is essential if they are to be integrated into the field of genomic medicine. In this issue of the journal, we introduce a peer-reviewed open-access article type, Open Debate, to accommodate novel and scholarly arguments that are informed by analysis and discussion, not just practical research. In the first article of this new type, Timothy Caulfield, Shawn Harmon and Yann Joly investigate the conflicts between open science and commercialization in genomics research [4].

Genomics has a culture of open data dating to before the time of the Human Genome Project, with the principles of accessibility formalized in the Bermuda agreement leading to an ongoing general principle that sequencing data should be released into the public domain as soon as possible after they are generated, and at least prior to publication. In the burgeoning field of medical sequencing, this principle has been tempered somewhat by considerations of patient privacy (a topic for another day), but as a rule, openness in genomics research continues to be both integral and essential. For example, it is hard to imagine how the recent explosion of genome-wide association studies, with their huge sample sizes, could have taken place without collaboration and data sharing. However, researchers are also increasingly encouraged to commercialize their research to speed product development and for monetary gain, which implies secrecy and competition. In their article, Caulfield and colleagues carry out an exploratory analysis of these two aspects of the policy guidelines from major funding bodies in the UK, US and Canada, concluding that these two opposing forces in genomics research may not be irreconcilable, but that a flexible middle way must be sought.

In the spirit of openness and fostering debate, we encourage our readers to use the Comments facility available on our website, or tweet @genomemedicine, to join in the discussion. The transition to genomic medicine is dependent upon the participation of researchers, ethicists, lawyers, clinicians and patients, and we'd like to hear your views.",2493713835,Rebecca F Furlong

The retraction of numerous studies from a wide range of disciplines, from climate science to bioscience, has drawn the focus of many commentators, but there exists a wider socio-cultural problem that pervades the scientific community. Sharing code, data and models often requires extra effort, this is currently seen as a significant overhead that may not be worth the time investment. Automated systems, which allow easy reproduction of results, offer the potential to incentives a culture change and drive the adoption of new techniques to improve the efficiency of scientific exploration. In this paper, we discuss the value of improved access and sharing of the two key types of results arising from work done in the computational sciences: models and algorithms. We propose the development of an integrated cloud-based system underpinning computational science, linking together software and data repositories, tool chains, workflows and outputs, providing a seamless automated infrastructure for the verification and validation of scientific models and in particular, performance benchmarks.",2336768898; 2187462706; 2026582897; 2127315210,Tom Crick; Benjamin A.

What this means in practice is that tools released under OSI-compliant licenses cannot use the “for non-commercial use only” disclaimers. A common worry [9] is that this affects whether the tool can be commercialized:

Do open source licenses stop me from commercializing my code?

No – no matter which open source license is used.

Do open source licenses mean that others can commercialize my code?

By definition, the open source code can be commercialized by anyone: the code’s author, their institution, an independent commercial entity, a private person. Literally anyone. This is independent of the exact OSI-compliant license used.

How do I choose a license?

The good folks of Github came to the rescue and created the ‘Choose an open source license’ service [10] for this. You can also browse for an appropriate license on the Open Source Initiative website [8]. Although some users believe that open source code should never be released under licenses that are “copyleft” [11] (these are the licenses which require that any derivative of the code is released under the same license), an equally good argument can be made [12] for GPL license-compatible licenses (which often are “copyleft”). While the use of permissive licenses that are not “copyleft” is more in the spirit of open science, Genome Biology currently accepts all OSI-compliant licenses.

How do I go about licensing my source code from the legal point of view?

Only the owner of the intellectual property rights to the source code can license it. While Genome Biology requires that the source code is released under an OSI-compliant license, it is the authors’ responsibility to ensure that they are within their rights to use such a license in the first place. Morin and colleagues provide a handy guide for the authors on what to do before you release your code under any license [13].",2275086787; 2497373859,Rafal T. Marszalek; Louisa Flintoft

At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources, and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However, Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet, it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing and the broader implications of 'Open Research'.",2151549144; 2195100187; 2149652406; 1581524534; 1993372211; 2019250667,Jonathan P.

Although different parts of UK policy on open access have not been universally well received by those in the academy and those in publishing, there have also been two official parliamentary hearings into open access; a set of reviews and recommendations, headed by Professor Adam Tickell; and a variety of implementation strategies from different private and public funders and institutions. In this chapter, I briefly cover the political and economic elements of open access as they have emerged in the UK, spanning: funders, politics, institutions, publishers, and academics.

This ecosystem includes outcomes and outputs modules, in particular institutional repositories managed by the nationwide service RCAAP (Scientific Open Access Repository of Portugal – http://www.rcaap.pt/ ). In order to achieve such vision, PTCRIS has two main goals. The first one is to define a regulatory framework based on the best international standards and practices. The second is to foster the adoption of such framework in the various information systems, both national (including RCAAP) and local (at the institution level). This paper reports the context, strategy and work developed thus far to make the Portuguese repositories network (RCAAP), with more than 40 repositories, compliant with the national research ecosystem (PTCRIS) by adopting its regulatory framework. Integrating RCAAP within the PTCRIS ecosystem will greatly contribute to promote open scholarship, open data and open science.",2336062673; 2724451961; 2693132515; 2684616547; 2602343370; 2589763029,João Mendes Moreira; Cátia Laranjeira; José Carvalho; Fernando Ribeiro; Paulo Lopes; Paulo Graça

More specifically, it is a conditio sine qua non for the realization of Open Science and at the same time it is indispensable for the monitoring and assessment of the quality and integrity of research. Various aspects play a role here: optimal infrastructures and tools for the actual handling of data during the research lifecycle, appropriate metadata to describe the datasets, and last but not least an adequate organizational framework to curate and archive the datasets professionally and provide optimal support and services to the researchers.The paper presents the Research Data Services (RDS) project of Radboud University (the Netherlands) in cooperation with one of the Dutch national research data archives: DANS (Data Archiving and Networked Services). In this project, a model is worked out for the archiving of research datasets via the CRIS (Current Research Information System) of the university, including both the registration of the metadata as well as the actual upload of the data files to the DANS archive. It is argued that an optimal solution is not only a technical matter, but also requires the definition and organization of appropriate support, management structures and workflows, involving both local and national partners. In this respect, attention is paid to the explanation of the frontoffice-backoffice model(FoBo) that is being defined and implemented as part of the project and which forms the organizational backbone of the solution worked out. The paper starts by arguing that aCRIS-oriented approach in research data archiving holds substantial added value, and it ends with an overview of lessons learned and a peek into the future of the RDS-project.",2581068382; 2520542304; 2519305299; 2618367209; 2518849400; 2406418467,Ed Simons; Mijke Jetten; Maaike Messelink; Marnix van Berchum; Hans Schoonbrood; Marion Wittenberg

The conference showcased advances in Earth system modelling, deploying observations and process understanding to develop more quantitative and predictive understanding of the interactions of the climate system, the biosphere and the anthroposphere. These tools extend understanding of the system dynamics of biogeochemical cycles, and give perspectives on the relationships between climate, ecosystems and human needs. As Earth system science is a global research endeavour, and its remit has important societal and policy implications, a recurrent theme in the conference was the responsibility of scientists working on knowledge integration in the global environmental change context.",2304378699; 1992372677,Sarah Cornell; Cat Downy

However, naturalistic studies that provide insights into contextual factors that engender students’ emotion experiences and how students manage these experiences to promote the achievement of their academic goals have been sparse. This study investigated secondary students’ emotion work (i.e., attempts to change the degree or quality of emotion experiences) within a distinctive learning environment. The forty-four participants (15-17 years old) were high-achieving students in a selective, science specialist school in the Philippines, who were undertaking two-year open school science inquiry projects with links to real-world research. Students’ emotion work narratives (68 written narratives and 57 narrative interviews) were collected over a ten-month period (which included an eight-month field work). Data analysis focused on situations that engendered emotion work and the strategies students used. School artefacts and students’ narratives were examined for ideas about achievement that were transmitted to and apprehended by students (i.e., achievement discourses), and how these discourses were linked to students’ emotion work. Five thematic groups of situations and four families of emotion work strategies were identified. The emotiveness of the situations was heightened by discourses that associated achievement with students’ social identities and extraordinary performances. Students’ emotion work served the instrumental goals of sustaining engagement in school work, managing the impact of problematic relationships with peers and teachers, and maintaining students’ social identities. Students demonstrated agency in how they harnessed for their emotion work the resources and opportunities afforded by their social networks and by the achievement discourses. This research underscores the role of emotion work in students’ effective functioning in a demanding learning environment with high levels of uncertainty. Its findings suggest the need for more research that explores students’ potential to shape their school experiences through emotion work.",2590856256,Zennifer Libo-on Oberio

The service enables online use of the data archived at FSD without requiring statistical skills. Target user groups are schoolchildren, students, journalists, decision-makers as well as ordinary citizens. We use FSD's DDI Codebook variable level documentation that exists in XML format to combine and harmonize longitudinal datasets for Tietomilli. Access to study level documentation is also provided in the service. Reusability of FSD's DDI Codebook descriptions is enhanced by using in-house tools. We will describe the tools and how we use DDI variable level documentation to make harmonization process of survey data more affordable and less discouraging of a task. Our presentation will focus on the back-end processes and programs. We will also discuss the challenges of the project and ideas for further developments. The project is funded by the Finnish Open Science and Research Initiative and is set to come to conclusion at the end of 2016.

These practices are promoted as strategies to improve the reproducibility of research findings and the replicability of studies to accumulate knowledge and advance science. However, these arguments may raise concerns for qualitative researchers, and open science practices pose several challenges for qualitative researchers. The purpose of this paper is: (1) to review the state of open science practices within sport and exercise psychology, and (2) to discuss the implications of open science for qualitative inquiry. We examined open science practices across quantitative and qualitative articles in 11 sport and exercise psychology journals. While OA publication is a relatively recent phenomenon, OA articles were cited slightly more often than non-OA articles, although this difference was not significant. Some researchers provided supplementary materials alongside published articles, but researchers do not appear to be openly sharing the methods and data from their studies. No articles were published as preregistered studies at the time of our review. Some benefits of open science practices for qualitative inquiry include transparent documentation of the research process, opportunities for collaborative and pluralistic analyses, access to data across multiple research sites and from difficult-to-access settings and participants, and opportunities for teaching qualitative inquiry. We conclude by addressing several key questions including participant consent, confidentiality and anonymity, analyzing de-contextualized qualitative data, storing and accessing data, study preregistration, and the principle of emergent design within qualitative inquiry.",2051941357; 2469060862,Katherine A.

Policies can increase the benefit potential to society of basic biomedical research by offering various kinds of incentives to basic researchers. In this paper we argue that soft incentives or “nudges” are particularly promising. However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The results of this study suggest that some soft incentives could be valuable tools to increase the transformative value of fundamental investigations without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists’ work satisfaction. After discussing the findings, we discuss a few examples of nudges for basic researchers in the biomedical fields.",2202533312; 1851960627; 2116398261,Andrea Ballabeni; Andrea Boggio; David Hemenway

ABSTRACT This paper examines the potential for collaboration between formal science professionals and loosely connected online groups that employ crowdsourcing to generate digital information resources.  What are the differences between scientists’ and other online groups’ preferred modes of governing knowledge creation? A distinction is drawn between constituted and adaptive modes of governance and similarities and differences between the two groups’ understandings of information curation and verification and openness are considered. It is suggested that open science will need to become more flexible if it is to build collaborations with loosely connected groups on equitable terms that respect their respective values and in ways that maximise the contributions of these groups to social problem solving.

At present, MOST primarily considers Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), which is a proprietary scientometric measure, as a measure of “quality”. Academic publishing is however, starting to move away from metrics such as the JIF that can be gamed, and that do not truly reflect the academic worth of individual scientists, or of journals. Metrics such as altmetrics, which show the paper’s popularity among social media, or a greater balance of metrics, to buffer the monopolized impact of the JIF on metrics-based rewards systems, may be issues that China and MOST need to consider as global academic publishing tends towards a state of open science where open access journals that reach a wider audience may have greater value than journals with a high JIF. Not only are China’s academics well-funded by the state, the Chinese academic market is a highly coveted market by publishers and other parties interested in advancing their academic or commercial interests. Given the current fluid and rapidly evolving state of academic publishing, and the fairly rigid JIF-based rewards system in place in China at the moment, coupled with a recent spate in academic misconduct from Chinese researchers, this letter offers some suggestions as to the need for China to rethink its policies regarding what factors influence academic rewards.",2148245922,Jaime A.

At the micro-level, prior work identified several potentialbenefits of such a strategy like superior access to informal information networks or the opportunity ofrecruiting the best PhD graduates. However, scientific research is costly and subject to considerableuncertainty with respect to the outcomes, and the disclosure may lead to spillover effects that decreasethe ability of firms to generate returns of their R&D investments. Overall, it remains unclear if andunder what conditions science-oriented strategies are beneficial for firms. We address this gap andexamine the impact of scientific activities on the firm’s market value using accounting data for USfirms from Compustat and matched patent and scientific publication data. We find evidence for apositive impact of scientific publication stocks on the firm value beyond the effects of R&D, patentstocks and patent quality.",2699078618; 2070481270,Markus Simeth; Michele Cincera

These applications of openness are having a profound, and sometimes transformative, effect on social, political and economic life. This explosion of the use of the term has led to multiple interpretations, ambiguities, and even misunderstandings, not to mention countless debates and disagreements over precise definitions. The paper “Fifty shades of open” by Pomerantz and Peek (2016) highlighted the increasing ambiguity and even confusion surrounding this term. This article builds on Pomerantz and Peek’s attempt to disambiguate the term by offering an alternative understanding to openness — that of social praxis. More specifically, our framing can be broken down into three social processes: open production, open distribution, and open consumption. Each process shares two traits that make them open: you don’t have to pay (free price), and anyone can participate (non-discrimination) in these processes. We argue that conceptualizing openness as social praxis offers several benefits. First, it provides a way out of a variety of problems that result from ambiguities and misunderstandings that emerge from the current multitude of uses of openness. Second, it provides a contextually sensitive understanding of openness that allows space for the many different ways openness is experienced — often very different from the way that more formal definitions conceptualize it. Third, it points us towards an approach to developing practice-specific theory that we believe helps us build generalizable knowledge on what works (or not), for whom, and in what contexts.",2604963158; 2522860073,Matthew Longshore Smith; Ruhiya Seward

While this theory is correct in its belief that good science focuses on openscience, it is no longer realistic to believe that the practical benefits thatmight arise from research are not the focus of many of those conducting theresearch.In evaluating the role of science today, an understanding of thelink between it and technology must be reached. Argues that the ability to patent such scientific facts or principles asgenes or gene codes will serve to hinder open science, as these findings serveas building blocks to future research and should not be restricted.One ofthe key groups involved in the future of open science is universities.Inrecent years, there has been a shift toward the patenting of universityresearch.While this patenting may be beneficial in some respects, thoseuniversities that limit the availability of a development with a potentiallywide use serve to hinder rather than advance open science.(SRD)",2290069171,Richard R.

The first part of the article looks at these movements and relates them to the relaunch in May 2015 of the UCL Press imprint as an OA imprint. This analysis has been undertaken by Dr Paul Ayris, Director of UCL Library Services and Chief Executive of UCL Press.  The second half of the article is a personal account by Lara Speicher, Publishing Manager at UCL Press, of the relaunch of the Press. This section looks at staffing structures, business models, technical infrastructures, publishing programmes and content.  In the final part of the article, Paul Ayris draws some conclusions from the history of the relaunch of UCL Press and sets these in the context of the global open science discussion.",2607971232; 2222841226,Paul Ayris; Lara Speicher

The Way to Open Science contains many  components. One of these  components would be open repositories based on open source software  with free access to researchers. Open access policies are essential, as are open infrastructures and open contents. Repositories can support this openness by offering open licenses, open metadata , the possibility to use open formats  and open thesauri.  Another principal point is transparency. Open peer review should be possible, and the description of processes should also be transparent. Of course, an open license should provide all data types and metadata as well. It is important to help researchers to make their results visible and accessible and to encourage them to publish in OA-Journals and use repositories for the underlying data. Open Access Policies are supporting these efforts. Open data can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose. In order to do so, Open Licenses are required. Also Metadata are important components of the Way  to Open Science. Metadata are data about data which should be free of all restrictions on access, structured and based on standards. Open formats are defined by a published specification and are not restricted in their use. They are mainly used by open-source software. Open Thesauruses are freely accessible for everyone without costs and with a free license. Open Processes should be documented, transparent, repeatable and reusable. An open peer review process is also  a step  forward to Open Science. Authors and referees are no longer anonymous. The whole process and the decision letters are open. Of course Open licenses allow the reuse of any work or data without any restrictions. The lecture will deal with various aspects of open science and focus on the role of repositories – with all chances and challenges.",2343770356,Susanne Blumesberger

We proposed to achieve this through the work of the Open Science Grid Consortium: a unique hands-on multi-disciplinary collaboration of scientists, software developers and providers of computing resources. Together the stakeholders in this consortium sustain and use a shared distributed computing environment that transforms simulation and experimental science in the US. The OSG consortium is an open collaboration that actively engages new research communities. We operate an open facility that brings together a broad spectrum of compute, storage, and networking resources and interfaces to other cyberinfrastructures, including the US XSEDE (previously TeraGrid), the European Grids for ESciencE (EGEE), as well as campus and regional grids. We leverage middleware provided by computer science groups, facility IT support organizations, and computing programs of application communities for the benefit of consortium members and the US national CI.",228437624; 220773886; 2562466686; 2581086844; 2550508797; 2561717156; 2691435011; 2612036971; 2296713013; 2562343600; 2563416036; 2561598454; 2743755611; 2113031002; 2664017675; 2562543649; 2561705688; 2566486446; 2561027901,Miron Livny; Ewa Deelman; William Barnett; Doug Olson; John McGee; Robert Cowles; F Wuerthwein; R.

Through observation of four journals in STEM disciplines, PLOS One, Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics, PeerJ, and F1000Research, an observational overview is conducted. The overview relies on defined characteristics of open peer review. Results show that despite differing open peer review implementations, each journal retains editorial involvement in scholarly publishing. Further, the analysis shows that only one of these implementations is fully transparent in its peer review and decision making process. Finally, the overview contends that journals should clearly outline peer review and editorial processes in order to allow for open peer review to be better understood and adopted by authors, reviewers, editors, and readers of science communications.",2533415344,Emily Ford

Moreover, biotechnology clusters are interesting and important intellectually and for policy deliberation. They pose questions about basic cluster theory because localised networks, though intense, may not be as extensive as global ones in firm practices, especially as these evolve over time. Moreover, innovation is more deeply embedded in the publicly funded science base than for 'Porterian' clusters. Regarding innovation, biotechnology is also less obviously Schumpeterian, there being little market-driven 'creative destruction', and is arguably, with its strong emphasis on both large and small firm 'capabilities' – Penrosian &ndash an emphasis in clustering research and applications that warrants further investigation.

To attain these objectives, sufficiently powered datasets with broad and deep phenotypic characterization, state-of-the-art neuroimaging, and genetic samples must be generated and made openly available to the scientific community. The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need. NKI-RS is an ongoing, institutionally-centered endeavor aimed at creating a large-scale (N>1000), deeply phenotyped, community-ascertained, lifespan sample (ages 6-85 years old) with advanced neuroimaging and genetics. These data will be publically shared, openly and prospectively (i.e., on a weekly basis). Herein, we describe the conceptual basis of the NKI-RS, including study design, sampling considerations, and steps to synchronize phenotypic and neuroimaging assessment. Additionally, we describe our process for sharing the data with the scientific community while protecting participant confidentiality, maintaining an adequate database, and certifying data integrity. The pilot phase of the NKI-RS, including challenges in recruiting, characterizing, imaging, and sharing data, is discussed while also explaining how this experience informed the final design of the enhanced NKI-RS.

The workshop organizers felt that the traditional model for disseminating scientific knowledge, through pay-walled peer-reviewed journal articles, has become both inefficient and unfair, and that the Open Access to publishing movement solves only part of the problem. The workshop took the four main functions of the academic article as a starting point for the discussion; a) dissemination of scientific knowledge, b) a forum for academic discussion, c) maintaining and monitoring the quality of research and d) determining academic merit. The aim was to reflect on alternative ways of meeting those functions, such that would support the principles of open science (transparency, accessibility, integrity). These alternatives included open research processes, altmetrics and open peer review. The effects of open practices on research integrity were also discussed.

The burgeoning field of neuroscience is at an important nexus of discovery. The pace of innovation is accelerating along with increased curiosity about how the most mysterious organ of the body works. Emerging technologies, such as optogenetics, permit an inquiry into brain function at unprecedented levels of detail and sophistication. Large-scale collaborations and Open Science frameworks make neural data available to more researchers, thereby expanding and democratizing the scientific process. These efforts generate big data sets, spanning multiple methodologies that benefit from machine learning and other analytic tools to elucidate brain-behavior relationships. As exemplified by the U.S. BRAIN Initiative, funding agencies are recognizing how investments in cutting-edge neuroscience transform knowledge in ways that can directly benefit society—from …",343853759,Kevin S.

Using a hand-collected data set describing the data-sharing behaviour of 488 randomly selected empirical researchers, we provide evidence that most researchers in economics and management do not share their data voluntarily. We derive testable hypotheses based on the theoretical literature on information-sharing and relate data-sharing to observable characteristics of researchers. We find empirical support for the hypotheses that voluntary data-sharing significantly increases with (a) academic tenure, (b) the quality of researchers, (c) the share of published articles subject to a mandatory data-disclosure policy of journals, and (d) personal attitudes towards “open science” principles.

First, all submissions to the journal are now screened by plagiarism detection software (iThenticate: www.ithenticate.com/). Second, we now explicitly offer our reviewers the option to sign their reviews so that their name is disclosed to the study authors in the decision letter. Here I describe the rationale behind these two innovations, and I welcome feedback from our readers, authors, and reviewers.

The pressure to publish can lead to a number of unfortunate consequences, including the temptation to take shortcuts when preparing manuscripts. Plagiarism is certainly not a new problem, but it may have become more prevalent as electronic databases of articles and other resources have proliferated. Since introducing the routine use of plagiarism detection software, we have detected a small number of potentially problematic cases. It is important to note that these are all then carefully read by a member of the editorial team before a decision as to how to proceed is made. The cases we have identified typically involve either authors using sections from their own publications again (particularly descriptions of methodological procedures), or only minimally reworking passages from other publications that are not their own. The first case is often understandable, in that it may be inefficient to completely rewrite the details of a procedure that is routinely used across many studies (and there are presumably only a finite number of ways to do so). We tend to take a pragmatic view in these cases, whilst also asking our authors to minimize direct overlap as much as possible. The second case is more problematic, and here we will return the manuscript to the authors and ask them to express the relevant sections in their own words. There is potentially a third case, where authors attempt to pass off entire publications by other authors as their own. This is a much more serious situation, but fortunately we have not yet encountered this since adopting the routine use of the plagiarism detection software, and my hope is that by making it known that we are using this software the likelihood of this happening will be low.

The introduction of the routine use of plagiarism detection software is motivated by a desire to prevent problematic behavior. The introduction of an explicit option for our reviewers to sign their review, on the other hand, is motivated by a despite to promote positive behavior. There is evidence that open peer review leads to higher quality reviews,1 and it is consistent with the growing interest in many quarters in open science (including open access, open data, and so on). Nevertheless, I am also conscious that some may not feel comfortable revealing their identity (eg, if an early career researcher has critical comments on the work of a more senior researcher). It is entirely at the discretion of our reviewers whether to sign their reviews, although I would encourage them to consider it. In my experience, it encourages more thoughtful, measured comments. It will be interesting to see what the uptake of this option is among our reviewers, but we are already beginning to see the option being used.

I feel that these are important innovations. The first removes the onus from our editors and reviewers to detect possible cases of plagiarism, and makes it more likely that problematic manuscripts will be identified. The second offers our reviewers the explicit option to reveal their names, without requiring this. My hope is that our use of plagiarism detection software will become increasingly irrelevant, and that the option to sign reviews will lead to greater openness in our review process, and further improves the quality of the already-excellent reviews we receive.",2303040408,Marcus R.

This movement has been referred to as open science. Open science offers a range of potential and measurable benefits – for researchers and the institutions that employ them as well as for society more generally. However, to realise these benefits, we must work towards changing current research practices and behaviours. Researchers will need to acquire new research data management and curation skills that enable them to undertake a broader range of tasks along the entire research lifecycle – from undertaking new means of collaboration, to implementing data management and sharing strategies, to understanding how to amplify and monitor research outputs and to assess their value and impact. In parallel, information professionals who work to support researchers and the open science process will also need to expand their research data management and curation skillsets. It will be equally important that current recognition and reward systems are amended to reflect the application of such skillsets within a range of disciplines. This paper will explore the potential role that librarians can play in supporting and progressing open science and discuss some of the new skills that librarians may require if they are to fulfil this role effectively. Citing examples from the current UK research landscape, this paper will map these skills to the Wellcome Trust and Digital Science’s CRediT Taxonomy which was developed in 2013 to enable the broad range of contributions involved in producing research outputs to be more consistently described and rewarded.",2502596385; 2477710812,Constance Bitso; Reggie Raju

Scientists are able to test hypotheses computationally instead of generating their own data, to complement their own data sets with data generated by others, and to conduct meta analyses across many data sets. In order to effectively exploit existing data, it is crucial to understand the content of repositories and to discover data relevant to a question of interest. These are challenging tasks, as most repositories currently only support finding data sets through text-based search of metadata and in some cases also through metadata-based browsing. In order to address these challenges, we have developed SATORI - an ontology-guided visual exploration system - that combines a powerful metadata search with a tree map and a node-link diagram that visualize the repository structure, provide context to retrieved data sets, and serve as an interface to drive semantic querying and browsing of the repository. The requirements for SATORI were derived in semi-structured interviews with biomedical data scientists. We demonstrate its utility by describing several usage scenarios using a stem cell data repository, discoveries we made in the process of developing them, and an evaluation of SATORI with domain experts. We have integrated an open-source, web-based implementation of SATORI in the data repository of the Refinery Platform for biomedical data analysis and visualization (http://refinery-platform.org).",2560868507; 257767137,Fritz Lekschas; Nils Gehlenborg

Fueled by recent evidence that the results of many clinical trials of interventions in common use are never published or reported and that these studies are not missing at random, a persuasive argument has been made that all data from human trials should be available to inform clinical practice.1–6 This would also promote higher quality and higher integrity science, although some urge caution as a result of concerns about unintended adverse consequences.7

In response to these calls for action, some companies have stepped forward and demonstrated leadership. GlaxoSmithKline, in coordination with other companies such as Roche and ViiV, committed early to data sharing.8 Medtronic contracted with our research team, the Yale University Open Data Access Project,9 to conduct external reviews of its clinical trial data for a single product. In addition, we developed policies and procedures to share these data with other investigators. Importantly, Medtronic fully transferred the decision-making authority on how to share the data and who could receive the data to the Yale University Open Data Access Project. Janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, has now contracted to do the same for the trials under its auspices. Increasingly, other companies are announcing their intention to share data from all published and unpublished clinical trials.

For the first, society needs to change the way it engages with science; engaging through culture and ideas has been a goal of Seed Media Group. For the second, there must be a mandated free flow of information; peer review must be reinvented; and scientific publishing needs to be removed from the hands of publishers and put in the hands of society.",2499657224; 2502713000,Adam Bly Presenter; Katy Ginanni Recorder

Our focus is on a key difference between them, namely whether they feature many studies each replicated by one lab (OSC) or one study replicated by many labs (Many Labs, RRRs), and the implication of this difference for assessing heterogeneity (or between-study variation) in effect sizes, generalizability, and robustness. We also offer recommendations for similar projects going forward. We then discuss what large scale replication might look like in other domains of psychological research where existing models of large scale replication are not feasible.

Norwegian national institutes will be the foundation for my research. To address the questions I create an online survey that will be used to find trends among the researchers, and augment the survey results with interviews to get a deeper understanding behind the reasons for these trends. I find that Norwegian national researchers are affected by IPR, whether it is consciously or unconsciously, but not in a manner that hinders innovation and research in a great amount.",2225311625,Stig-Ole Berg Tøgersen

To analyze the conditions supporting Open Science, we develop an overlapping generations model that focuses on the trade-off between disclosure and secrecy. While secrecy yields private returns that are independent of the actions of future generations, the benefits of disclosure depend in part on the use of disclosed knowledge by the subsequent researchers. We show that Open Science and Secrecy are both potential equilibria, and that the feasibility of Open Science depends on factors such as the costs of accessing knowledge from prior generations and the relative benefits to private exploitation under secrecy versus disclosure. In parameter regions where both Open Science and Secrecy can be supported, Open Science is associated with a higher level of social welfare. The analysis has policy implications for a number of areas, including public support for research training, appropriate design of formal intellectual property, and the role of scientific norms and institutions (such as an effective peer review process) in maintaining Open Science over the long run.",2134379788; 2185602207,Arijit Mukherjee; Scott Stern

The results indicate that high levels of academic entrepreneurship in a scientific field are associated with less reliance on the gift-giving form of sharing (generalized exchange) traditionally recommended by scientific communities, and with a greater emphasis on direct benefits for givers (direct exchange), as well as a lower overall frequency of sharing. These shifts in sharing behavior are observed even among individual scientists who are not themselves entrepreneurially active, suggesting a general shift in scientific norms contingent on institutional contexts. These findings reflect the contradictions inherent in current science policies that simultaneously encourage open science and commercial application of research results, and suggest that the increasing emphasis on commercial activity may be fundamentally changing the normative structure of science.",2162300226,Sotaro Shibayama

Keywords: Amazon Mechanical Turk; Online Experiments; jsPsych; psiTurk; Open Science This section of the tutorial will be a brief introduction to some of the issues surrounding AMT and online experiments, but the focus of the tutorial will be parts 2 and 3. Online experiments are appealing for a number of reasons: faster data collection, lower costs, access to a different subject pool, and improved anonymity of subjects and experimenters are some of the most commonly named. However, online ex- periments give up some of the control of a laboratory environ- ment, leading to concerns about the quality of the data. There are now several published results that compare AMT exper- iments to their laboratory counterparts (Paolacci, Chandler, & Ipeirotis, 2010; Buhrmester, Kwang, & Gosling, 2011; Zwann & Pechler, 2012; Crump, McDonnell, & Gureckis, 2013; Goodman, Cryder, & Cheema, 2013). In the tutorial, we will summarize these findings and their implications for running AMT based experiments. Objectives This half-day tutorial will cover how to build and deploy on- line experiments using jsPsych, psiTurk, and Amazon Me- chanical Turk (AMT). jsPsych is an open-source JavaScript library that facilitates building behavioral experiments in a web browser. psiTurk is an open-source Python platform that simplifies the process of running an experiment using AMT. Together, these two software packages reduce the complex- ity of setting up an online experiment on AMT, enabling researchers with little software programming experience to take advantage of online experiments. By the end of the tu- torial, participants will have gained hands-on experience in programming and deploying a basic behavioral experiment on AMT. Researchers in the Cognitive Science community have been using AMT, and online experiments in general, for sev- eral years, but the learning curve can be steep for researchers who are not familiar with web development. While some tools exist for certain kinds of simple experiments (e.g. ques- tionnaires), programming more complex experiments with dynamic elements requires knowledge of web-oriented pro- gramming. The tools covered in this tutorial simplify the pro- cess of programming online experiments, opening up the pos- sibility of conducting online experiments to more researchers in the cognitive science community. Workshops covering AMT (Mason & Suri, 2011) and psi- Turk (Coenen, Markant, Martin, & McDonnell, 2013) have been offered at previous Cognitive Science Society meetings. This tutorial goes one step further by covering jsPsych as well. Together, these tools cover the entire process of assem- bling and running an online experiment. Part 2: Assembling an experiment with jsPsych jsPsych (http://www.jspsych.org) is an open-source JavaScript library that simplifies the process of writing a web-browser-based experiment (de Leeuw, 2014). jsPsych contains a core library, which serves as the engine to run experiments, and a set of plugins, each of which defines a different kind of trial that a subject in an experiment might do. For example, there are plugins for displaying instructions, showing stimuli and collecting responses via the keyboard, and displaying a consent form. Assembling an experiment with jsPsych involves putting together the differ- ent plugins that are needed and specifying the parameters of those plugins (such as what stimuli to show and how long to show them). These plugins can be assembled to create many different behavioral tasks that are of interest to cognitive scientists. jsPsych can also be extended by writing new plugins. The structure of a plugin is flexible enough to permit most kinds of computer-based tasks. Because plugins are individual, stand- alone components of the library, each plugin can be combined with any of the others. As researchers use and extend jsPsych Outline of the Tutorial Participants at the tutorial will be invited to work hands-on with the creation of a simple online experiment that demon- strates the principles behind jsPsych and psiTurk. The tutorial will be organized in four parts.",2232346028; 2122851253; 704830063; 2293348153; 2143309664; 2232828861; 358209969,Josh de Leeuw; Anna Coenen; Douglas Markant; Jay B. Martin; John V.

A structural model is proposed and estimated using data from the fourth edition of the French Community Innovation survey (CIS4) with 2.302 R&D performing firms from manufacturing sectors and matched scientific publication data. The analysis provides evidence that a need for academic knowledge sources leads to Open Science contributions by firms, indicating that the access to these knowledge holders imposes the adoption of academic principles in terms of disclosure. Besides, mixed evidence is found that overall industry conditions, including the protection mechanism, influence the cost-benefit rationale of firms in respect to disclosure",2250674015,Markus Simeth

It is increasingly believed that this data, which forms the basis for each macromolecular structure discovered by this field, must be archived and, in due course, published. Furthermore, the widespread use of shared scientific facilities such as synchrotron beamlines complicates the issue of data storage, access and movement, as does the increase of remote users. This work describes a prototype system that adapts existing federated cyberinfra­structure technology and techniques to significantly improve the operational environment for users and administrators of synchrotron data collection facilities used in structural biology. This is achieved through software from the Virtual Data Toolkit and Globus, bringing together federated users and facilities from the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, the Advanced Photon Source, the Open Science Grid, the SBGrid Consortium and Harvard Medical School.

The implementation of European Union Regulation on IAS can benefit from the involvement of the public in IAS recording and management through Citizen Science (CS) initiatives. Aiming to tackle issues related with the use of CS projects on IAS topics, a dedicated workshop titled “Citizen Science and Open Data: a model for Invasive Alien Species in Europe” was organized by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Association). Fifty key stakeholders from all Europe, including two Members of the European Parliament, attended the workshop. With a clear focus on IAS, the workshop aimed at addressing the following issues: a) CS and policy, b) citizen engagement, and c) CS data management. Nine short presentations provided input on CS and IAS issues. Participants discussed specific topics in several round tables (“world cafe” style) and reported back their conclusions to the audience and full assembly moderated discussions. Overall, the workshop enabled the sharing of ideas, approaches and best practices regarding CS and IAS. Specific opportunities and pitfalls of using CS data in the whole policy cycle for IAS were recognized. Concerning the implementation of the IAS Regulation, CS data could complement official surveillance systems, and contribute to the early warning of the IAS of Union concern after appropriate validation by the Member States’ competent authorities. CS projects can additionally increase awareness and empower citizens. Attendees pointed out the importance for further public engagement in CS projects on IAS that demonstrate specific initiatives and approaches and analyze lessons learned from past experiences. In addition, the workshop noted that the data gathered from different CS projects on IAS are fragmented. It highlighted the need for using an open and accessible platform to upload data originating from CS sources or to mirror validated data into a single, easy-to-use web service, in line with the EU Open Science Strategic Priority. The workshop provided ten key recommendations of best practices for CS projects on IAS, addressed to researchers, policy makers and implementing authorities, indicating future research and policy directions and opportunities.",2168004667; 2151290987; 2146055732; 2166784451; 2732999607; 2730062671; 2731473372; 2130539853; 2726902908; 2106918915; 2730693932; 2778224608; 2551904482; 1973651053; 2730361553; 1919829382; 2534963045; 2725057574; 2728236044,Ana Cristina Cardoso; Eleanor Jennings; Melanie Josefsson; Bernat C.

Openness is often deeply embedded in information technology (IT) and can be both a driver for and a result of innovative IT. To clarify the concept of “openness”, we provide an overview of the scope of cross-disciplinary research on openness. Based on this overview, we develop a framework of openness, which proposes a higher-order concept of “openness” characterised by transparency, access, participation and democracy. The framework further distinguishes open resources, open processes and the effects of opening on particular domains. To provide the historical context and to appreciate the role of IT in openness, we discuss two historical examples of openness: the introduction of an open science model in academia (openness without IT) and the emergence of open source software development (openness with IT). We conclude by highlighting some concerns with and limitations of “openness”.",2198096696; 2106280427; 2172047718; 2110963832; 2557853290,Daniel Schlagwein; Kieran Conboy; Joseph Feller; Jan Marco Leimeister; Lorraine Morgan

We investigated possible effects of these guidelines by assessing practices in empirical articles published by Psychological Science and, for comparison, by Clinical Psychological Science and the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, during the period January 2013 to December 2015. Use of null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) was close to universal at all times and in all journals. In Psychological Science, use of confidence intervals overall, increased markedly, from 5.5% of articles in 2013 to 52.5% in 2015, as did the availability of open data (4 to 39%) and open materials (7 to 31%).

An open collaboration community of willing sharing members thrives on a virtuous cycle: increased sharing often offers stronger reasons for more people to share. However, it may also decline when the cycle goes the opposite direction and turns vicious. What determines the dividing line? We offer insights into this important question based on an analytic understanding of the concept of rational sharing, which is sharing for net gain in personal utility. In a nutshell, a community thriving on rational sharing is essentially an economic system, a platform for creating mutual benefit through exchanges.
	This analysis is based on our prior work in statistical modelling of peer–to–peer systems. There are two salient features. First, the shared content is modelled as a mixture of different types of goods. Members’ sharing is pooled and organized into supply, which in turn is brought to match with demand from the members themselves, and a wider community also in the case of open access. The importance of the goodness of match between supply and demand is therefore apparent. Second, incentive schemes are modelled simply as dependence between the quality of service a member sees and the level of sharing. Being simplistic, it points to an interesting generic observation: no incentive is strong enough to break the catch–22 situation during startup unless some seed content is present.
	We are not suggesting rationality as the only conscious basis of sharing for individuals. Quite the contrary, we gauge the limits of rational sharing thereby, and identify when and how non–rational bases of sharing is needed. For instance, high quality open access Wikis we witness today would not have been sustainable if sharing had been purely rational, as meaningful reward in quality gain has to be reserved for enticing rational members.",2143434760,Wai-Yin Ng

The journal system served numerous fundamental needs within the scientific community and encouraged a climate of increased sharing of knowledge. As the rhetoric of scientific discourse evolved over time, a highly stable format emerged to govern the research article as a genre. In the contemporary era of networked science, however, informal scientific communication is also growing in importance as researchers turn to online collaborative tools for even more rapid sharing of results and work in progress.",2139653275,John Carey

Thanks to recent advances in the field of genomics, extensive sequencing has been performed for a deep genomic analysis of this huge collection of samples. A strategy based on different approaches, such as metabarcoding, metagenomics, single-cell genomics and metatranscriptomics, has been chosen for analysis of size-fractionated plankton communities. Here, we provide detailed procedures applied for genomic data generation, from nucleic acids extraction to sequence production, and we describe registries of genomics datasets available at the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA, www.ebi.ac.uk/ena). The association of these metadata to the experimental procedures applied for their generation will help the scientific community to access these data and facilitate their analysis.

From the point of view of information, this new paradigm touches everything: resources, processes and outcomes, thus it is an imperative to know the construction of these new architectures of knowledge regarding issues such as access, opening or closing them. In this paper we approach to the cyberinfrastructure of the Large Hardon Collinder, LCH from the Centre Europeenne pour la Recherche Nucleaire, CER,N and we do it, from the focus of the open science, ‘openness’, movement under construction which we try to inquire the scaffolding of their epistemology (knowledge as a common resource and public domain). For this we deconstruct, at first, the regulations at CERN, trying to trace its mesopolitics and discourse, its understandings and ways of conducting science in this current context. And ultimately, following other sociologists of science, we approached at a local research group from a Spanish university, part of the LHCb from the CERN collaboration to see how are shaping to these models of per-production, its reading, practices and behaviors in relation to issued / ignored discourses by the collaboration.",2154134008,María-de-Lourdes Pérez-González

The author believes that through new methodology and management of science, ""we have an opportunity to change the way knowledge is constructed"", (p. 206) This new collaborative, internet-enabled, completely open, scientific research and problem-solving paradigm is called networked science. Clear descriptions of both a foundational framework with detailed analysis as well as several inspiring applied examples of how networked science has worked are provided. Neilsen begins by explaining the Tim Growers' mathematical challenge problem posted on Growers' blog on the internet. Here the collective skills of the group (27 collaborators contributed) solved an exacting open problem in just 37 days. This was called the Polymath Project. Nielsen goes on to describe GenBank, an online database of genetic information used by numerous collaborators, as well as the Galaxy Zoo project, where 200,000 online volunteers help classify galaxy images. Neilsen comments on the evolution and success of Wikipedia and Linux as the most massive and open of these kinds of collective efforts, although he also reflects on scientists as a steadfast conservative group that primarily values writing rarely read scientific papers rather than contributing to the more influential, frequently read Wikipedia entries. So it is usually when collaboration and credit for promotion and recognition are both present that modern scientists do their best work. Nielsen concludes his first chapter by explaining that this new way of doing science is important because ""it means speeding up things such as curing cancer, solving the climate-change problem, launching humanity permanently into space."" (p. 11)My favorite example of collaboration in the book is the chess match of world champion Gary Kasparov against the World Team (actually over 50,000 people who voted online for the daily moves against the champion). It took 62 moves for Kasparov to prevail. The World Team's strategy was far stronger than any one individual who participated and the collective group played extremely well against a far-superior opponent. The technical chess advice for the collaboration was assembled through an online forum to discuss options as the open internet participants voted each day for the next move of the World Team. The advice forum was written by teenaged chess players who were good players but nowhere near the level of Kasparov. It is amazing to me that this cooperative voting methodology was able to do so well. …",2337929585,Chris Arney

The RDS-Project at Radboud University (NL) in cooperation with DANS.,2016,2016-01-01T00:00:00.0000000,,0,0,0,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.knaw.nl%3Apublications%2F16acd340-d3a3-4af5-aa3d-90686609e48e,"Optimal research data management and archiving is a key condition for progress in modern science and of vital importance from both the point of view of research as such as well as research policy and management. More specifically it is a conditio sine qua non for the realisation of Open Science and at the same time it is indispensable for the monitoring and assessment of the quality and integrity of research. Various aspects play a role here: optimal infrastructures and tools for the actual handling of data during the research lifecycle, appropriate metadata to describe the datasets, and - last but not least - an adequate organisational framework to curate and archive the datasets professionally and provide optimal support and services to the researchers. The paper presents the “Research Data Services (RDS)” project of Radboud University (NL) in cooperation with one of the Dutch national research data archives: DANS (Data Archiving and Networked Services). In this project a model is worked out for the archiving of research datasets via the CRIS1 of the university, including both the registration of the metadata as well as the actual upload of the data files towards DANS. It is argued that an optimal solution is not only a technical matter, but also requires the definition and organisation of appropriate support and management structures and workflows, involving both the local and national partners. In this respect attention is paid to the explanation of the “FoBo-model” (Front Office – Back Office) that is being defined and implemented as part of the project and which forms the organisational backbone of the solution worked out. The paper starts by arguing that a CRIS-oriented approach in research data archiving holds substantial added value, and ends with an overview of lessons learned and a peek into the future of the RDS project.",2581068382; 2520542304; 2582157062; 2519305299; 2518849400; 2406418467,Ed Simons; Mijke Jetten; M. van Berchum; Maaike Messelink; Hans Schoonbrood; Marion Wittenberg

We consider a model with efficient bargaining ex ante in which firms do not compete in the final market. Assuming that the complementary innovations constitute a common input and that agents make complementary investments in its private exploitation, we find that, when complementarities are sufficiently strong, a commitment to openness may provide greater incentives than an exclusion regime. The theoretical framework may be applied to interpret Open Source Software licenses, intellectual property rights licensing arrangements within research joint ventures and royalty stacking issues. From a public policy standpoint, the paper allows to identify conditions under which the openness regime may be an appropriate choice to elicit further development of publicly funded technologies.",2153866967; 2154497236,Massimo D'Antoni; Maria Alessandra Rossi

In cultural studies, history, law, political science and sociology, Open Access publishing is still an innovation at the margins. Yet Open Access is demonstrably the superior publishing model in the WWW Galaxy. Research networks, scholarly communities and academic tribes would do well to consider how to switch their communication and publishing to Open Access. The penalty for failing to do this will be decreased visibility and diminished impact, followed ultimately by a decline in public and philanthropic funding. For everyone, this article outlines the compelling reasons to switch to OA. Moreover, we have a common agenda when it comes to the means whereby Open Access is achieved. We will all suffer if a sub-optimal lock-in occurs and innovation spaces are blocked. Therefore, full and partial OA solutions are evaluated. There is also a genuine need for collaboration when it comes to developing the next generation of overlay services such as literature awareness tools, information mining tools and search engines. This paper features the Budapest Open Access Initiative, the Berlin Declaration on Open Access, the UN WSIS and OECD positions on OA, and trans-national federations such as SciELO, DSpace and EPrints. It shows how economics and law (SSRN and RePEc) are moving towards OA and indicates that OA is the emerging standard in European integration research (as it is in Biomed with the Wellcome Trust manadatory OA policy). Five roads are outlined on the way to making Open Access the standard for all scholarly communication.",2427573700,Chris Armbruster

We propose that the key to this is the sharing of methods and processes. We present myExperiment, a social web site for discovering, sharing and curating Scientific Workflows and experiment plans, and describe how myExperiment facilitates the management and sharing of research workflows, supports a social model for content curation tailored to the researcher and community, and supports Open Science by exposing content and functionality to the users' tools and applications. Based on this, we introduce the notion of the Research Object—the work objects that are built, transformed and published in the course of scientific experiments—and suggest that by encapsulating methods with results we can achieve research that is more reusable and repeatable and hence rapid and robust.

Concerns about a crisis in monograph publishing date back to at least the 1990s, and for traditional journal publishing at least a decade.
Two key trends behind concerns over book and journal models are pressures on funding and the emergence of open access.
Despite predictions of a revolution, the academic publishing sector has proved remarkably resilient in adapting to market changes.
Whilst showing some support for ‘open science’, even early career researchers remain committed to traditional publishing models.
The growth in scholarly collaboration networks and in sharing across traditional boundaries is the more likely disrupter of traditional publishing.",2318288603,Francis Dodds

Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature.Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification.This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads. The median normalized closeness centrality, a measure of knowledge flow, resulting from the distributed peer code review system was high, 0.46.",2159283422; 2306924604; 2164410340; 2123820514; 2554974777,Matthew McCormick; Xiaoxiao Liu; Julien Jomier; Charles Marion; Luis Ibanez

This has been underpinned by the assumption that widespread and free access to research outputs leads to (1) better and more efficient science, (2) economic growth, in particular for small and medium-sized enterprises wishing to capitalise on research findings, and (3) increased transparency of knowledge production and its outcomes. The latter in particular could function as a catalyst for public participation and engagement. Whether OS is likely to help realise these benefits, however, will depend on the emergence of systemic incentives for scientists to utilise OS in a meaningful manner. While in some areas, the environmental sciences have a long tradition of open ethos, citizen inclusion and global collaborations, such activities need to be more systematically supported and promoted by funders and learned societies in order to improve scientific research and public participation.",2277750656; 2627969484; 335779252,Sabina Leonelli; Daniel Spichtinger; Barbara Prainsack

Presenter - Frederic Brodkom. The ARES-CCD (formerly CUD) is the French-speaking universities and high-school of Belgium Commission for the Cooperation to Development. With an annual budget of 31 M€ fully dedicated to the academic development of actually 19 universities of North and Central Africa, South-East Asia, Western South America and Greater Antilles, this commission brings together volunteers of the academic, scientific and administrative staffs of our universities. Since 2000, librarians are strongly involved in this project with the aim to develop the partner’s libraries, to improve their infrastructures and operations, to facilitate their access to documentary resources and to strengthen their librarians' skills. Given the important documentary needs of students and researchers in the South and the lack of financial resources, the promotion of Open Science is more than an obvious. We will show that, in addition to our activities of purchasing books or materials, basic training or library renovation, we develop, in close partnership with our colleagues, the Open Science culture in six fields: (1) The installation and support of open-source ILS (mainly KOHA and PMB), including the learning of IT teams (2) The harvesting and promotion of OA resources via our Web Portal, including subscription to official resources of international organization (3) The development of policies to develop local institutional repositories for new and archived (printed) publications and thesis (DSpace support, purchase of scanner, etc) (4) The support to the development of university presses to reduce/abolish the excessive cost of printed course materials for students (5) Training and awareness-raising of library trainers for academic social networks, data exchange platforms, community-based researchers' sites, OA use, etc. (6) Promote the obligation to deposit in our university repositories the scientific papers financed by the ARES-CCD cooperation and co-signed by Belgian researchers and partners of developing countries (academic and doctorate students). Concrete case studies of our 17 years of experience in the South from Haiti to Vietnam will illustrate these actions. Perspectives on future projects will also be discussed, such as a week, jointly with all our partners, of exchange and work in Belgium in 2018 (as already done in 2016) on the topic of the practical implementation of Open Access in their universities.

To this purpose, the study combines in an original way data on scientific co-authorship and data on patent co-invention at the level of individual researchers for three science intensive technology fields, i.e. lasers, semiconductors and biotechnology, in order to assess the extent of overlap between the two communities and to identify the role of key individuals in the process of knowledge transfer. Our findings reveal that the extent of connectedness among scientists and inventors is rather large. The resulting network exhibits the topological properties of a small-world graph, which are thought to be associated to a rapid transmission and diffusion of knowledge. A key role in ensuring this connectivity is played by specific individuals, i.e. authors-inventors, that act as gatekeepers bridging the boundaries across the two domains. Moreover, such individuals tend to occupy a prominent position in both the scientific and the technological network. In this respect, our analysis also show that, although in general authors-inventors are more prominent and central actors in both networks, a potential trade-off may nonetheless exists for specific individuals. Nurturing a highly central position in the scientific network comes in fact at the expense of being able to locate in a similarly central position in the technological network (and viceversa).",205378489; 2322421849,Stefano Breschi; Christian Catalini

Both services, and their sponsoring organizations, the California Digital Library (CDL) and the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), have succeeded in enabling researchers to comply with funder requirements in producing DMPs. However, this is just one step along the road to advancing open science.We see an opportunity to further leverage DMPs to support open science by integrating them into the broader ecosystem of data management infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, we must redefine success to include not just adoption of our services by institutions but also widespread adoption by individual researchers, disciplinary communities, and funders. Working together with all stakeholders to make DMPs an essential, open part of the research lifecycle, and not just a matter of compliance, is the next step toward effectively managing and sharing research data.We propose to join forces and build a new, global data management advisory platform that links DMPs to other components of the research lifecycle. The biomedical research community provides an opportunity to adapt the infrastructure and associated educational resources to one specific disciplinary community and plug into new initiatives. We will reposition DMPs as living documents useful for structuring the course of biomedical research activities and integrating with related data management systems to lower the barriers for implementation and promote culture change. Consolidating around a single platform for DMPs extends our reach, keeps costs down, and moves best practices forward, allowing us to participate in a truly global open science ecosystem.",2700724050; 2776457135; 2598904557; 2515087739; 2710239036; 2293320523; 2282230910,Stephanie Simms; Sarah Jones; Kevin Ashley; Marta Ribeiro; John Chodacki; Stephen Abrams; Marisa Strong

We trace back almost 30 years of history across selected user facilities illustrating the evolution of facility data management practices and how these practices have related to performing scientific research. The facilities cover multiple techniques such as X-ray and neutron scattering, imaging and tomography sciences. Over time, detector and data acquisition technologies have dramatically increased the ability to produce prolific volumes of data challenging the traditional paradigm of users taking data home upon completion of their experiments to process and publish their results. During this time, computing capacity has also increased dramatically, though the size of the data has grown significantly faster than the capacity of one's laptop to manage and process this new facility produced data. Trends indicate that this will continue to be the case for yet some time. Thus users face a quandary for how to manage today's data complexity and size as these may exceed the computing resources users have available to themselves. This same quandary can also stifle collaboration and sharing. Realizing this, some facilitiesmore » are already providing web portal access to data and computing thereby providing users access to resources they need. Portal based computing is now driving researchers to think about how to use the data collected at multiple facilities in an integrated way to perform their research, and also how to collaborate and share data. In the future, inter-facility data management systems will enable next tier cross-instrument-cross facility scientific research fuelled by smart applications residing upon user computer resources. We can learn from the medical imaging community that has been working since the early 1990's to integrate data from across multiple modalities to achieve better diagnoses - similarly, data fusion across BES facilities will lead to new scientific discoveries.« less",2103422978; 2498800581; 2139065278; 2077581545; 2140303920; 2151101088; 2627521066; 2655718564; 2641260906; 2063443187; 1217962163,Stephen D Miller; Paul S.

Efforts to improve research outcomes have resulted in genomic researchers being confronted with complex and seemingly contradictory instructions about how to perform their tasks. Over the past decade, there has been increasing pressure on university researchers to commercialize their work. Concurrently, they are encouraged to collaborate, share data and disseminate new knowledge quickly (that is, to adopt an open science model) in order to foster scientific progress, meet humanitarian goals, and to maximize the impact of their research.",2609006185; 2004880120; 1973113305,Timothy Caulfield; Shawn Harmon; Yann Joly

When done thoughtfully, this approach to citizen science can transform humans and their environment. Despite such possibilities, many projects struggle to meet decision-maker needs, generate useful data to inform decisions, and improve social-ecological resilience. Here, we define leveraging the ‘power of place’ in citizen science, and posit that doing this improves conservation decision making, increases participation, and improves community resilience. First, we explore ‘place’ and identify five place dimensions: social-ecological, narrative and name-based, knowledge-based, emotional and affective, and performative. We then thematically analyze 134 case studies drawn from CitSci.org ( n  = 39), The Stewardship Network New England (TSN-NE; n  = 39), and Earthwatch ( n  = 56) regarding: (1) use of place dimensions in materials (as one indication of leveraging the power of place), (2) intent for use of data in decision-making, and (3) evidence of such use. We find that 89% of projects intend for data to be used, 46% demonstrate no evidence of use, and 54% provide some evidence of use. Moreover, projects used in decision making leverage more ( t  = − 4.8, df  = 117; p x ̅ = 3.0; s  = 1.4) than those not used in decision making ( x ̅ = 1.8; s  = 1.2). Further, a Principal Components Analysis identifies three related components (aesthetic, narrative and name-based, and social-ecological). Given these findings, we present a framework for leveraging place in citizen science projects and platforms, and recommend approaches to better impart intended outcomes. We discuss place in citizen science related to relevance, participation, resilience, and scalability and conclude that effective decision making as a means towards more resilient and sustainable communities can be strengthened by leveraging the power of place in citizen science.",2128066226; 2558040639; 2511548829; 2126958121; 2537483881; 5972658; 2484380874; 2168137208; 2125357329; 2643617526; 2507651338,Greg Newman; David Mellor; J.

These include Open Access repositories, Open Access journals, or hybrid publishing. For some years, researchers have been using new ways to communicate and share their work by using academic social networks.

In an attempt to foster the development of Open Access in France, the French consortium COUPERIN (Unified Consortium of Higher Education and Research Organizations for Access to Numerical Publications) proposed that academic social networks could be used to convince researchers of becoming more involved in Open Access. To test this hypothesis, a nationwide survey was launched in 2014 to explore whether and how these academic social networks are used to share content, but also how they compare to other Open Access classic tools. Within a month (20 May to 20 June), 1,898 researchers answered this 28-question survey. It was fully completed by 1,698 of them. This provides COUPERIN with considerable data for analysis. The respondents roughly reflect the composition of the French academic community in terms of gender and research fields, with a slight overrepresentation of young researchers/ PhD candidates.

This survey does not, however, cover the in-depth opinions of researchers on Open Access and academic social networks. It therefore only presents general tendencies. Nonetheless, the survey gives many indications as to how researchers apply Open Access. In addition, it shows how they feel about the usefulness of these networks compared to repositories when efficiently disseminating their work. This survey also takes the differences between disciplines into account and characterizes behaviour and opinions according to the different disciplinary communities and their research practices.

Finally, this survey allows us to define the main characteristics of a tool which could meet French researchers’ needs for scientific communication. The components of such an ideal tool dedicated to Open Science could include efficient repositories to easily disseminate work and improve visibility, a sharing network and the scientific stamp of peer-review.",2336882256,Christine Okret-Manville

Results declared in the literature are, however, only rarely interlinked with existing databases and even more rarely interlinked with each other. We describe a method to take factual statements reported in the literature and turn them into semantic networks of RDF triples. We use a method based on finding titles of papers that contain positive, direct statements about the outcome of a biomedical investigation. We then use dependency parsing and an ontological perspective to create and combine graphs of knowledge about a domain. Our aim in this work is to collect knowledge from the literature for inclusion in the Kidney and Urinary Pathway Knowledge Base (KUPKB), which will be used in the e-LICO project to illustrate the utility of data-mining methods for biomarker discovery and pathway modelling.",2001047709; 2481909982; 2146999750,James Eales; George Demetriou; Robert Stevens

Working closely with researchers on campuses throughout the US and in collaboration with national cyberinfrastructure initiatives, we transform their computing environment through new concepts, advanced tools and deep experience. We discuss examples of these including: the pilot-job overlay concepts and technologies now in use throughout OSG and delivering 1.4 Million CPU hours/day; the role of campus infrastructures- built out from concepts of sharing across multiple local faculty clusters (made good use of already by many of the HEP Tier-2 sites in the US); the work towards the use of clouds and access to high throughput parallel (multi-core and GPU) compute resources; and the progress we are making towards meeting the data management and access needs of non-HEP communities with general tools derived from the experience of the parochial tools in HEP (integration of Globus Online, prototyping with IRODS, investigations into Wide Area Lustre). We will also review our activities and experiences as HTC Service Provider to the recently awarded NSF XD XSEDE project, the evolution of the US NSF TeraGrid project, and how we are extending the reach of HTC through this activity to the increasingly broad national cyberinfrastructure. We believe that a coordinated view of the HPC and HTC resources in the US will further expand their impact on scientific discovery.",2584698497; 2743755611; 2278219369; 228437624; 2566486446; 2125772623; 2530383884,L.

As a result, researchers are looking for practical solutions, not only to enhance scientific collaborations, but also to acquire larger amounts of data, and to access specialized datasets. In many cases, the realities of data acquisition present a significant burden, therefore gaining access to public datasets allows for more robust analyses and broadly enriched data exploration. To answer this demand, the Montreal Neurological Institute has announced its commitment to Open Science, harnessing the power of making both clinical and research data available to the world (Owens 2016). As such, the LORIS and CBRAIN (Das 2015) platforms have been tasked with the technical challenges specific to the institutional-level implementation of open data sharing, including: 1) Comprehensive linking of multimodal data (phenotypic. clinical, neuroimaging, biobanking and genomics, etc.) 2) Secure database encryption, specifically designed for institutional and multi-project data sharing, ensuring subject confidentiality (using multi-tiered identifiers). 3) Querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented and de-identified subject data. 4) Configurable pipelines and flags to facilitate acquisition and analysis, as well as access to High Performance Computing clusters for rapid data processing and sharing of software tools. 5) Robust Workflows and Quality Control mechanisms ensuring transparency and consistency in best practices. 6) Long term storage (and web access) of data, reducing loss of institutional data assets. 7) Enhanced web-based visualization of imaging, genomics, and phenotypic data, allowing for real-time viewing and manipulation of data from anywhere in the world. 8) Numerous modules for data filtering, summary statistics, and personalized and configurable dashboards. Implementing the vision of Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute will be a concerted undertaking that seeks to facilitate data sharing for the global research community. Our goal is to utilize the years of experience in multi-site collaborative research infrastructure to implement the technical requirements to achieve this level of public data sharing in a practical, yet robust manner.",2216897145; 2632863415; 2761329284; 1930150689; 2508483930; 2042194736; 2569238774; 2572551554; 2310351820; 2570601884; 1968117993; 2067462695; 2511761752; 541099792; 2617461634; 2201425526; 2655663727; 2323808038; 1981415780; 2125517609; 2609063338; 2162503942; 2626326575; 2041105566; 2480990259; 728032583; 2607553491; 2154543916; 2571124241; 2742252291; 2763958874; 2570673041; 2304061909; 2569708485,Samir Das; Najmeh Khalili-Mahani; David MacFarlane; Penelope Kostopoulos; Pierre Rioux; Cécile Madjar; Xavier Lecours-Boucher; Sandeep Vanamala; Reza Adalat; Zia Mohaddes; Vladimir Fonov; Tristan Glatard; Sylvain Milot; Ilana R.

To actively promote the stewardship of all the research data that are produced at Leiden University, a comprehensive, institution-wide programme was launched in 2015, which centrally aims to encourage its researchers to carefully plan the temporal storage, long-term preservation and potential reuse of their data. This programme, which is managed centrally by the Department of Academic Affairs, and which receives important contributions from academic staff, from Leiden University Libraries, and from the University’s central ICT organisation, basically consists of three parts. Firstly, a basic central policy has been formulated, containing clear guidelines for activities before, during and after research projects. The central aim of this institutional policy is to ensure that all Leiden-based research projects can effectively comply with the most common requirements stipulated by funding agencies, academic publishers, the Dutch standard evaluation protocol and the European data protection directive. As a second part of the data management programme, faculties have organised workshops and meetings, concentrating on the rationale and on the technical and organisational practicalities of effective data management in order to bring about a discipline-specific protocol. Data librarians employed by Leiden University Libraries have developed educational materials and provide training for PhDs in the principles and benefits of good data management. Thirdly, to ensure that scholars can genuinely make a reasoned selection among the many tools that are currently available, a central catalogue was developed which lists and characterises the most relevant data management services. The catalogue currently provides information about, amongst many other aspects, the organisations behind these services, the main academic disciplines which are targeted and the accepted file formats and metadata formats. The various aspects of these facilities have been classified using terminology provided by conceptual models developed by the UKDA, ANDS and the DCC. Using Leiden University’s policy guidelines as criteria, the overall suitability of each service has also been evaluated. Leiden University’s data management programme has a total duration of three years, and its basic objective is to offer a comprehensive form of support, in which the data management policy which is propagated centrally is complemented by various forms of assistance which ought to make it easier for scholars to adhere to this policy. The catalogue of data management services also aims to bolster the implementation of an adequate technical infrastructure, as the qualitative evaluations of the services enable policy-makers and developers to quickly establish gaps or other shortcomings within existing facilities.",2686435437; 2588024339; 2685513697; 2590060222,Peter Verhaar; Fieke Schoots; Laurents Sesink; Floor Frederiks

While academic studies on open innovation are burgeoning, most research on the topic focuses on the later phases of the innovation process. So far, the impact and implications of the general tendency towards more openness in academic and industrial science at the very front-end of the innovation process have been mostly neglected. Our paper presents a conceptualization of this open science as a new research paradigm. Based on empirical data and current literature, we analyze the phenomenon and propose four perspectives of open science.

libraries in open science activities, identify the strategies used in marketing open science platforms and
enumerate the challenges hindering the success of open science in the selected countries. The study was
guided by the qualitative school of thought where the researcher builds a complex, holistic picture, analyses
words, and reports detailed views of informants, and conducts the study in a natural setting. The study
employed the multiple case study research design approach to assess how academic libraries in Ghana,
Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda promote open science. The findings show that there are few scholarly
journals which exist in open access for most African academies in Ghana, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda.
Though not massively adopted, open access institutional repositories have been used to preserve and
publicize the digital contents in some academic institutions in Africa such as theses, dissertations,
administrative and heritage materials, conference proceedings as well as pre-prints and post-print of journal
articles. The study recommends the intensification of open science advocacy in academic libraries in Sub-
Saharan Africa; institutions should ensure that there is a stable electricity supply as well as reliable internet
connectivity, introducing regular training on emerging media technologies to the community members and
strengthening the libraries consortium in Sub-Saharan Africa as an enabling platform to share intellectual

Feature articles have glossed the pages and covers of not only the most prominent science publications, but also the news media. Yet two crucial discussions are seldom clearly captured: Why (we care) and How (to do it). The why is today more important than ever: the success and credibility of science are on the line. Perverse incentives in academia interrupt our best intentions, so let’s agree on where our responsibilities lie with reproducibility. The how of reproducible research, on the other hand, can be surprisingly contentious. Should we use spreadsheets (no), point-and-click GUIs (it depends), or version control (yes)? What are the commitments we need to make—whether student, mentor, author, reader, funder? Often the focus of the conversation has been on open data and code. In my group, we have been practicing open science for years, but we found the hard way that open code is merely a first step. We need to exhaustively document our computational research, to encourage and accept publication of negative results, and to apply defensive tactics against bad code: version control, modular code, testing, and code review. The tools and methods require training, but if you establish the why, the how will follow.",2759928386,Lorena A. Barba

Allianz-Lizenzen) beinhalten spezifische Regelungen zum Open Access. Die Erfahrung der seit 2011 getatigten Allianz-Abschlusse zeigt allerdings, dass der Kreis berechtigter Autorinnen und Autoren eigenstandig kaum Gebrauch ihrer hierdurch erhaltenen Open-Access-Rechte macht. Entsprechend liegt ein groser Schatz wissenschaftlicher Literatur bei den Verlagen, der noch zu heben ist. Das bewilligte DFG-Projekt DeepGreen (Ausschreibung „Open-Access-Transformation"" von 2014) zielt darauf ab, die vereinbarten Open-Access-Konditionen der Allianzlizenzen auf technischer Ebene komfortabel auszugestalten und wenn moglich zu automatisieren, so dass nicht mehr Autorinnen und Autoren oder die hierzu berechtigten Bibliotheken die Publikationen manuell in Open-Access-Repositorien einpflegen mussen, sondern die Verlage selbst zyklisch uber definierte Schnittstellen abliefern. Dazu bauen die Projektpartner (Universitatsbibliothek Erlangen-Nurnberg, Universitatsbibliothek TU Berlin, Helmholtz Open Science Koordinationsburo am Deutschen GeoForschungsZentrum, Bayerische Staatsbibliothek Munchen sowie die Verbunde Bibliotheksverbund Bayern und Kooperativer Bibliotheksverbund Berlin-Brandenburg) ein Dark Archive namens DeepGreen auf, in das teilnehmende Allianzlizenz-Verlage ihre Publikationen und Metadaten einspeisen. DeepGreen soll im Anschluss wiederum als Datendrehscheibe fur berechtigte Open-Access-Repositorien dienen. Als Pilotpartner konnten die Verlage Karger und SAGE gewonnen werden. Die Universitatsbibliothek Erlangen-Nurnberg als Initiatorin des Projekts und der Kooperative Bibliotheksverbund Berlin-Brandenburg (KOBV) als Hauptentwickler von DeepGreen stellten das Projekt und den Stand der Umsetzung am 6. Bibliothekskongress 2016 in Leipzig vor. The acquisition standards of national licences supported by Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) (referred to as alliance licences) include specific open access policies. This ensures that both authors and licensees have the right to archive and publish the included content of alliance agreements in repositories under more advantageous conditions than the standard self-archiving policies (e. g. publisher´s version, shortened embargo periods). However, empirical research concerning the alliance licences contracted since 2011 has shown that entitled authors make almost no use of their open access rights. Thus, a tremendous amount of scientific literature has yet to be uncovered from publishers’ closed access systems. The project DeepGreen, approved by DFG (based on the 2014 initiative „Open Access Transformation“), seeks to establish a convenient and automated technical infrastructure to support existing open access agreements. The intended scenario is that publishers will be required to deliver periodically all publications eligible for open access through defined interfaces, instead of authors (or their respective libraries) having to upload these items manually into corresponding open access repositories. To this end, the members of the project consortium (University Libraries of Friedrich-Alexander University Erlangen-Nurnberg (FAU) and TU Berlin, Helmholtz Open Science Office at the German GeoResearch Centre, Bavarian State Library, and two Librarian Network Organizations, BVB and KOBV) will build the platform DeepGreen, essentially a dark archive, into which publications and metadata are fed periodically according to the publishers’ contracted alliance licences. In turn, the platform Deep-Green will deliver these publications to the legitimate repositories automatically. Two publishers, Karger Publishers and SAGE Publications, have agreed to pilot the project as associated partners. This paper presents the project and the current status of the work.",2415884591; 1687031985,Markus Putnings; Beate Rusch

This book takes a look at the interesting developments in publishing coming from the countries with emerging economies known as BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), which comprise 40% of the world’s population and whose GDPs comprise 18% percent of the world’s economy. Each of these countries has a unique economic system as well as differing systems of academic higher education and research. As a result, they have each developed different models of academic publishing for the dissemination of their research results, many of which are based on principles of open access.

This book closes a gap in the literature of academic publishing by examining the strategies employed in STI publishing in these countries. As a growing part of the international STI market, they will impact the ways in which information is produced and made available in the future. The models examined here can serve as alternative options for information delivery in developed countries, and may serve as more sustainable models for emerging economies in Africa and Latin America.

Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa all developed their own way to open access, based on specific blends of green and gold road, public investment and private initiatives. What they have in common, is their commitment to research as a driver of economic and societal development and to open science as a way to enhance quality, impact and access to scientific information. Open access is not an end in itself but a means to better science.

Twelve established information professionals and scientists from seven countries contribute to this book and help the reader to understand the open access situation in the emerging countries. How are they doing what they are doing, and why? Where are the bottlenecks, and what are the challenges? What can be learned? Each chapter is introduced by ""Facts & Figures,"" a section with basic data about each country, on its economic performance, research and development, scientific output and open access publishing.

Brazil: The first chapter presents the open access journal platform ScieELO, the most important open access server for scientific journals worldwide, with an impact well beyond Brazil.

Russia: Chapter two provides a general overview on institutional initiatives for free dissemination of public research on the Internet, especially in the field of grey literature, in a society with strong traditions of public interest prevailing on private intellectual property.

India: Along with a detailed description of the open access movement in India, the third chapter informs about awareness and acceptance of institutional repositories and open access journals among the Indian scientific communities.

China: The author presents the results of a recent survey on the development of open access journals in China. This is interesting insofar as only very few titles are known and indexed outside of China.

South Africa: The last chapter shows how open access can increase its impact and also protect local content, and how it can build on African cultural traditions and values of Ubuntu, i.e. relatedness, sharing and generosity.

Each chapter tells a story, and each story is different. A virtual roundtable concludes the book, with a focus on shared values and engagement in the international community of open access and open science. This book provides an important overview of publishing trends in BRICS nations and will be of interest to anyone concerned with the future of academic publishing, including librarians, higher education researchers, and publishers. It also provides insights regarding copyright issues, the economics of publishing and STI, and international affairs.",2562179114,Joachim Schöpfel

Information overload, special competences need in the area of information analysis, demand of business innovation, a struggle in the grant jungle are strong factors that influence the daily work flow for a researcher. Taking these aspects into consideration, we introduce a concept that we have named The State of The Research. Aim. We aim to broaden the researcher’s view in his/her research area and give insights into new opportunities for innovation and collaboration. The idea here is that the researchers would also be able to use a part or the whole package of the State of The Research in their future grant applications. Method. Our concept is a comprehensive package containing medical information analysis and visualization, news and social media monitoring, patent landscape analysis, and bibliometric analysis – all based on the particular research area of interest for the individual researcher/research group. We are using text mining tools in combination with visualization related to PubMed and Chemical Abstracts to extract research related questions from larger data sets. By using bibliometric mapping techniques, we can also reveal structures in the studied research field, e.g. networks of influential authors, clusters of key concepts and frequently cited articles. We are approaching the researchers face to face in their environment where we present the compiled material describing The State of The Research. For example, we cover a broad disease area that has been selected in advance in collaboration with the researchers. With our analysis tools, we recognize collaboration opportunities and approximate freedom to operate within the research based on patents. We have taken trend analysis in a form of co-word analysis related to time to indicate possible rising or falling research within a disease area. Preliminary results. Personal communication and an understanding in each individual field of The State of The Research get the researchers attention. This in turn has also led to increased requests for deeper analysis. Future prospects and developments will be to offer education in grant application writing Moreover, we would like to use more general text mining approaches to answer research related questions faster and with larger datasets. In sum, allocation of research funds is becoming more competitive and we need to support our researchers not only with bibliometric analysis but with new concepts like The State of The Research to give support to researcher´s grant applications.

While industry's involvement in academic research is growing, various scholars have warned that this trend might corrupt open science by fostering secrecy in academia, and by leading scientists toward less publishable lines of work. In this study, we argue that, under certain circumstances, academia-industry collaboration can sharpen the particularities of the academic institutional environment rather than corrupt it. We propose that in research lines with both high scientific and commercial potential, scientists in industry and academia might be able to draw on the distinctive capabilities of their respective institutional environments, therefore leading to an increase in academic productivity within the collaborative line of research. An empirical challenge is that research projects that involve industry collaborators may be qualitatively different from those that do not. To address this issue, we exploit the occurrence of simultaneous discoveries where multiple scientists make roughly the same discovery around the same time. Following a simultaneous discovery, we compare the subsequent research trajectories of academic scientists who collaborated with industry on the discovery to academic scientists who did not. Counter to the argument that industry collaboration corrupts academic institutional norms, we find that academic scientists who collaborated with industry produce more publications and fewer patents on their collaborative research lines than their academic peers who did not collaborate with industry. We show that these effects are particularly salient when the industry partner is an established company, rather than a startup.",51170426; 2119155038; 2607876618,Michaël Bikard; Keyvan Vakili; Florenta Teodoridis

Traditionally, many bloggers have assumed that readers are most interested in information presented at prestigious and popular scientific meetings. As a result, the readers and bloggers often ignore blogs of local scientific meetings. We hypothesize that blog readers will utilize blogs about local scientific meetings less than those about national meetings.

We examined nephrology-pertinent blogs from 2010-2012. Blogs were categorized as ""local/regional"" or ""national/international"" based on the majority of the audience that attended the live scientific meeting. We tracked the number of pageviews, reading time, and location of use per blog for the first 90-days after its first availability on the website. Wilcoxon testing was performed on all data.

There were 9 local/regional and 11 national/international scientific meetings for which blogs were available. The mean number of page views was significantly lower in blogs from local/regional than national/international conferences (84.7 versus 160.3, respectively; p < 0.01). However, the mean difference in total reading time between both categories of blogs was not significant (p = 0.25).

Data from this investigation do not fully support the hypothesis that readers utilized local/regional blogs less than national/international blogs. Although local/regional blogs attracted fewer readers (lower pageviews), the content in these blogs was compelling enough to keep the reader equally engaged as with national/international blogs.",2101904456; 2299948934; 2117697933,Tejas Desai; Xiangming Fang; Maria Ferris

(2014),2015,2015-12-01T00:00:00.0000000,NIH Public Access,0,3,3,http://saudepublica.bvs.br/pesquisa/resource/pt/mdl-26237287; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4701621/; https://iths.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/is-motivational-interviewing-effective-at-reducing-alcohol-misuse,"Meta-analysis is a quantitative synthesis methodology aimed at systematically searching and screening relevant studies and integrating the findings from the eligible single studies to generate more robust and efficient estimates. Meta-analysis shows the magnitude and consistency of the overall effect size under investigation across studies. When the effect is consistent, it can then be generalized to a larger population. Reflecting this important utility, there has been a meteoric rise in the number of meta-analysis publications (Sutton & Higgins, 2008). Furthermore, meta-analysis is increasingly seen as a method to combat the current reproducibility crisis in preclinical and clinical trial research (Begley & Ellis, 2012; Ioannidis, 2005) and, more generally, as an important tool for open research practices (Cooper & VandenBos, 2013; Cumming, 2014; Eich, 2014; Open Science Collaboration, 2012). For these reasons, findings from meta-analyses weigh heavily in evidence-based decision making.


Meta-analysis studies, however, are not without limitations, some of which may be inherent to a method that relies on aggregated data (AD) from published studies (Cooper & Patell, 2009). In addition, like all methodologies, meta-analysis must be applied properly to yield valid conclusions. The present review was motivated by a recent meta-analysis by Foxcroft, Coombes, Wood, Allen, and Almeida Santimano (2014) for the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews that evaluated the effectiveness of motivational interviewing (MI) interventions for heavy drinking among adolescents and young adults up to age 25. Their study included 66 randomized controlled trials of individuals between the ages of 15 and 25, of which 55 studies were quantitatively analyzed for alcohol outcomes. Foxcroft et al. concluded that: 

There are no substantive, meaningful benefits of MI interventions for the prevention of alcohol misuse. Although some significant effects were found, we interpret the effect sizes as being too small, given the measurement scales used in the studies included in the review, to be of relevance to policy or practice (p. 2).


Foxcoft et al. further stated that the quality of evidence was low to moderate and, consequently, the reported effect sizes in their meta-analysis may be overestimated. The resulting press coverage declared “Counseling Has Limited Benefit on Young People Drinking Alcohol” (ScienceDaily news, 2014, August) and “Counseling Does Little to Deter Youth Drinking, Review Finds” (HealthDay news, 2014, August).

Given the potential impact that Foxcroft et al. (2014) may have on intervention and policy development, as well as clients' understanding of their treatment options, it is important to critically examine the study's methodology and conclusion. The quality of evidence is just as important for meta-analysis reviews as for single studies when making recommendations to clinicians in the field (see the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation [GRADE] approach; Guyatt et al., 2008). In discussing Foxcroft et al. for the present article, we utilize available reporting guidelines for meta-analysis studies, such as the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA; Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & The PRISMA group, 2009) of randomized controlled trials. The PRISMA has been adopted by many journals and organizations, including the Cochrane Collaboration, all BMC journals, and PloS One. The Meta-Analysis Reporting Standards (MARS) has been adopted by the American Psychological Association (APA) as part of the Journal Article Reporting Standards (JARS) by the APA Publications and Communications Board Working Group (2008). A new open access journal Archives of Scientific Psychology by APA (Cooper & VandenBos, 2013) further elaborates the MARS to help authors to improve the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. We also utilized other tutorial articles and textbooks (e.g., Borenstein, Hedges, Higgins, & Rothstein, 2009).",2165923229; 2075862491; 2779204389,Eun Young Mun; David C. Atkins; Scott T. Walters

What's more, as opposed to what you may expect, research has become less proficient in the course of the most recent 60 years, in spite of developments in clinical exploration: the quantity of medications affirmed every year has remained moderately static, while the money related assets required for R&D have taken off at a rate well past expansion. Furthermore, the high cost of R&D adds to the high cost or medicines: projections appraise that by 2016, worldwide spending on pharmaceutical advancement will surpass $1.2 trillion annually,3 setting a weight on patients and general worldwide wellbeing resources.4 Meanwhile, pharma organizations are under expanding weight to lessen the cost of medications, on account of the blend of non specific medication rivalry and the expanding hesitance of insurance agencies to repay for costly new treatments unless they are better than less costly options.

Via a survey we collected information about 280 French academic inventors. This enables us to put forward new insights with respect to the effect of university patenting on the diffusion of scientific research, incentives to do basic research, commercialization of university inventions and access to upstream knowledge. In particular, the study suggests a tradeoff between enabling the transfer of university inventions to industry in some sectors and delaying the dissemination of scientific research. On the one hand, most academic inventors acknowledge a lag in their publication process directly attributable to the patent application but, on the other hand, in life science disciplines a large majority of respondents who have had one of their inventions commercialized, believe that this would not have been the case had a patent not been there.",2501511297,Julien Pénin

Drawing on the European e-InfraNet project, we adopt a broad definition of Open, including activity alongside content, and identify the different Open domains, their salient characteristics and relationships. We propose a high-level typology and model of Open to inform policy design and delivery, and employ Willinsky’s framework for open source and open access to discuss the theoretical underpinnings of openness, finding important commonalities among the domains, which suggests that the framework can extend to all the Open areas. We then examine potential shared benefits of Open approaches, which reinforce the argument for a unified policy agenda.

The activity of IOSA has been going through several phases, from the initial cataloguing of software programs on the http://www.iosa.it/ website, to the development of dedicated software tools, advanced documentation and the involvement in international initiatives. In 2007 IOSA was in a moment of passage between the first “explorative” phase and the following phase, with the first applications in our respective fields of studies, some experiments in programming with high-level languages (Python), the management of web-based information systems and the never ending cataloguing of cultural heritage.

The emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of “open science"" was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the Scientific Revolution. It represented a break from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of Nature’s Secrets, to a new set of norms, incentives, and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. The rise of “cooperative rivalries” in the revelation of new knowledge, is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the Renaissance system of court-patronage of the arts and sciences; pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exacerbated by the claims of mathematicians and the increasing practical reliance upon new mathematical techniques in a variety of “contexts of application.” Reputational competition among Europe’s noble patrons motivated much of their efforts to attract to their courts the most prestigious natural philosophers, was no less crucial in the workings of that system than was the concern among their would-be clients to raise their peer-based reputational status. In late Renaissance Europe, the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority had resulted in relations between noble patrons and their savant-clients that resembled the situation modern economists describe as ""common agency contracting in substitutes"" -- competition among incompletely informed principals for the dedicated services of multiple agents. These conditions tended to result in more favorable contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) for the agent-client members of the nascent scientific communities. This left the new scientists better positioned to retain larger information rents on their specialized knowledge, which in turn tended to encourage entry into the emerging disciplines. They also were thereby enabled collectively to develop a stronger degree of professional autonomy for their programs of inquiry within increasingly specialized and formal scientific academies which, during the latter seventeenth century, attracted the patronage of rival absolutist States in Western Europe.",2584665884,Paul A.

A resume is included of the case for raw diffraction data deposition. An overall context is set by highlighting the initiatives of science policy makers towards an `Open Science' model within which crystallographers will increasingly work in the future; this will bring new funding opportunities but also new codes of procedure within open science frameworks. Skills education and training for crystallographers will need to be expanded. Overall, there are now the means and the organization for the preservation of raw crystallographic diffraction data via different types of archive, such as at universities, discipline-specific repositories (Integrated Resource for Reproducibility in Macromol­ecular Crystallography, Structural Biology Data Grid), general public data repositories (Zenodo, ResearchGate) and centralized neutron and X-ray facilities. Formulation of improved metadata descriptors for the raw data types of each of the IUCr Commissions is in progress; some detailed examples are provided.

And although our motivation comes from biosciences, the following is true for many areas of science: published results are usually hard to reproduce either because data is not available or tools are not readily available, which delays the adoption of new methodologies and hinders innovation. Our focus is on tool readiness and pipelines availability. Even though most tools are freely available, pipelines for data analysis are in general barely described and their configuration is far from trivial, with many parameters to be tuned. 
In this paper we discuss how to effectively build and use pipelines, relying on state of the art computing technologies to execute them without users need to configure, install and manage tools, servers and complex workflow management systems. We perform an in depth comparative analysis of state of the art frameworks and systems. The NGSPipes framework is proposed showing that we can have public pipelines ready to process and analyse experimental data, produced for instance by high-throughput technologies, but without relying on centralized servers or Web services. 
The NGSPipes framework and underlying architecture provides a major step towards open science and true collaboration in what concerns tools and pipelines among computational biology researchers and practitioners. We show that it is possible to execute data analysis pipelines in a decentralized and platform independent way. Approaches like the one proposed are crucial for archiving and reusing data analysis pipelines at medium/long-term.

Often these datasets consist of many files that may be transferred by multiple clients in parallel. We study two techniques that improve the use of available resources for these large, long-running, multi-file transfers. First, we adapt transfer parameters for multi-file transfers based on recent transfer performance. Second, we use VO and site policies to influence the allocation of system resources for transfers, such as available transfer streams.

Based on 486 nanotechnology projects from five national R&D programs in South Korea, canonical correlation analysis is used to analyze the relationships among R&D parameters of inputs, outputs and outcomes and to determine principle parameters. As a result, this study concludes that the principal parameters are publications with high impact, patents, and academic degrees. This study also shows a positive correlation between activities in open science and closed science. The conclusions suggest that research results with high impact value should be endorsed by the Korean government and should try to keep a balance between R&D exploitation in open science and closed science. This study would be used for establishing South Korea's R&D policy effective for faster commercialization of nanotechnology related research.",2290041393; 2123378092,Young-Don Cho; Hoo-Gon Choi

University Libraries should engage with and promote:
• The development and dissemination of information services (provide technical resources, multipurpose database [funding, impact, researchers, teams or institutions] and provide physical meeting spaces and events).
• Expansion of services (provide support and access, conduct training activities, and develop systems for evaluating the cooperative work and activities of research groups/research teams).

Frequently however, the quality of antibodies does not meet the expectations of consumers, causing loss of valuable time and money. This can delay research efforts and scientific discovery, or even lead to false, irreproducible results to be published in the scientific literature. This raises the question of whether there should be universal standards for validating antibodies.  

During the 1 st International Antibody Validation Forum, hosted by St John’s Laboratory Ltd on October 15 th 2014 at Queen Mary University of London, scientists from academia and industry presented data highlighting quality issues arising from lack of antibody validation. While the forum identified significant current problems in the antibody market, it also discussed future opportunities for improved quality and transparency by encouraging data disclosure and data sharing. This article highlights the key issues and conclusions reached at the forum.",2613587737; 2514080350; 2509306129,Peter D. Reiss; Danxi Min; Mei Y. Leung

Young researchers of today will shape the field in the future. In light of current debates about social psychology’s research culture, this exploratory survey assessed early-career researchers’ beliefs (N = 88) about the prevalence of questionable research practices (QRPs), potential causes, and open science as a possible solution. While there was relative consensus that outright fraud is an exception, a majority of participants believed that some QRPs are moderately to highly prevalent what they attributed primarily to academic incentive structures. A majority of participants felt that open science is necessary to improve research practice. They indicated to consider some open science recommendations in the future, but they also indicated some reluctance. Limitation and implications of these findings are discussed.",2470776284; 1768161315; 2768284315; 2768749197,Stefan Stürmer; Aileen Oeberst; Roman Trötschel; Oliver Decker

Der Beitrag arbeitet die Bedeutung heraus, die dem Verhaltnis von Citizen Science und den Geisteswissenschaften aktuell zukommt. Dies geschieht mit engem Bezug zu vier Fallbeispielen aus der Geschichtswissenschaft. Diese verfugt mit ihrer Subdisziplin Public History mittlerweile uber einen eigenen Arbeitsbereich, der sich in Forschung und Lehre popularen Geschichtsdarstellungen, vor allem aber den Wechselwirkungen zwischen (Geschichts-)Wissenschaft und Offentlichkeit widmet. Neben der Vielzahl neuer Akteure, die heute an der Erarbeitung und Verbreitung historischen Wissens beteiligt sind, haben sich aber auch die Raume in denen Wissenschaft betrieben und uber ihre Ergebnisse diskutiert wird, stark gewandelt.

Given the significant cut in our proposed budget we changed the scope of the ANDSL to focus on the software aspects of the laboratory – workload generators and monitoring tools and on the offering of experimental data to the ANI project. The main contributions of our work are twofold: early end-user input and experimental data to the ANI project and software tools for conducting large scale end-to-end data placement experiments.,2490154002,Miron Livny

While the requirements and benefits of data exchange are widely discussed, there are few proposals on how to implement data platforms that not only permit the exchange of research data among researchers, but also permit to distribute research results and data to the interest public. We elaborate what points are important for implementing a (geographic) data repository and propose then to adopt the concept of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) as a solution for the implementation of research data repositories. We present as a case study the geographic data and document repository of the Chilean research Centre on Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS), the CEDEUS Observatory. Besides the infrastructure to host and distribute data, communication tools are an important component of such a data repository service. For this case study we analyse which things have worked well and which things have not worked well based on the experiences collected during three years of operation. We close with some recommendations for the implementation of data repositories for research.",2735126966; 2735654827; 2736068924; 2735911464; 2734872099,S. Steiniger; H. de la Fuente; C. Fuentes; J.

Research councils are key institutions in bringing about changes proposed by these movements, as sponsors and facilitators of research. In this paper we identify the approaches used in Canada, the US and the UK to advance open science, as a step towards understanding how policy in this area is evolving. The findings highlight three broad patterns across the countries, showing that open science is supported not only be the activities of individual research councils, but also through government mandates and inter-council cooperation. These patterns involve efforts to create a digital infrastructure for open science, to foster open access, and to support open data initiatives.",2322565838; 2100373333; 2100299067,Helen Lasthiotakis; Andrew Kretz; Creso M.

In this paper we report the analysis of questionnaire data with a particular focus on pupil perceptions of research in the sciences and of the scientific method. The questionnaire was a 25-item Likert Scale (1-5) distributed to seven collaborating schools. We received 2634 returns from pupils across key stages 3, 4 and 5. We also asked teachers to complete the questionnaire in order to explore how they thought their pupils would respond. We received 54 teacher responses. Statistically significant differences in the responses were identified through a chi-square test on SPSS. As what is being taught influences secondary pupil views on research we also consider how the term ‘research’ appears in the national curriculum for England and Wales and the three main English exam boards. The main theoretical construct that informs our analysis of the questionnaire data and the national curriculum is Angela Brew’s 4-tier descriptor of perceptions of research (domino, trading, layer, journey). We use this framework in order to map what, when and how research is presented to school pupils in England and Wales. We also use this framework in order to highlight and discuss certain pupil views that emerged from the questionnaire data and which indicate areas where curriculum and pedagogy intervention may be necessary: pupils seem less confident in their understanding of research as involving the identification of a research question; and, they often see research as a means to confirm one’s own opinion. They do however understand research as involving the generation of new knowledge and the collection of new data, such as interviews and questionnaires as well as laboratory work, field trips and library searches and they appear relatively confident in their statements about their ability to do research, their school experiences of research and the importance of research in their future career choice.",2276324309; 1754729756; 2163861362,Kay Yeoman; Laura Bowater; Elena Nardi

However, due to the almost exclusive utilization of cross-sectional designs in previous studies, it remains unknown whether these individual differences in voice pitch emerge before, during, or after sexual maturation, and whether voice pitch remains stable into adulthood. Here, we measured the F0 parameters of men who were recorded once every seven years from age 7 to 56 as they participated in the British documentary Up Series. Linear mixed models revealed significant effects of age on all F0 parameters, wherein F0 mean, minimum, maximum, and the standard deviation of F0 showed sharp pubertal decreases between age 7 and 21, yet remained remarkably stable after age 28. Critically, men’s pre-pubertal F0 at age 7 strongly predicted their F0 at every subsequent adult age, explaining up to 64% of the variance in men’s post-pubertal voice pitches. This finding suggests that within-individual differences in voice pitch that are known to play an important role in men’s reproductive success are in fact largely determined by age 7, and may therefore be linked to pre-natal and/or pre-pubertal androgen exposure.",2515248800; 1998258584; 224341827; 27601079,Meddy Fouquet; Katarzyna Pisanski; Nicolas Mathevon; David Reby

Yet the focus on agency often glosses over the constraints placed on agents, particularly within asymmetrical power relations. This article follows the case of BabyLegs, a do-it-yourself monitoring tool for marine microplastic pollution, and the attempt to keep the technology open source within an intellectual property (IP) system set up to privatize it. The tactics used to design BabyLegs as a feminine, silly, doll-tool to discredit the device in the eyes of an IP system that valued traditional gender roles lead to the eventual success of keeping the device open source. Yet, those same tactics also reinforced and reproduced the structures of power and essentialism they were designed to resist. I characterize this technological ambivalence as compromise, and argue that all agency exercised within asymmetrical power relations is compromised. This is not to say resistance is futile, but that agency is never pure, and this recognition lets us be more intentional in how we might compromise as practitioners of diverse scientific knowledges.",45941769,Max Liboiron

As a mode of generating reliable knowledge, “open science” depends upon a specific non-market reward system to solve a number of resource allocation problems that have their origins in the particular characteristics of information as an economic good. There are features of the collegiate reputational reward system -- conventionally associated with open science practice in the academy and public research institutes – that create conflicts been the ostensible norms of ‘cooperation’ and the incentives for non-cooperative, rivalrous behavior on the part of individuals and research units who race to establish “priority.” These sources of inefficiency notwithstanding, open science is properly regarded as uniquely well suited to the goal of maximising the rate of growth of the stock of reliable knowledge. High access charges imposed by holders of monopoly rights in intellectual property have overall consequences for the conduct of science that are particularly damaging to programs of exploratory research which are recognized to be vital for the long-term progress of knowledge-driven economies. Like non-cooperative behaviors among researchers in regard to the sharing of access to raw data-steams and information, and systematic under-provision the documentation and annotation required to create reliably accurate and up-to-date public database resources, lack of restraint in privatizing the public domain in data and information can significantly degrade the effectiveness of the entire research system. Considered at the macro-level, open science and commercially oriented R&D based upon proprietary information constitute complementary sub- systems. The public policy problem, consequently, is to keep the two sub-systems in proper balance by public funding of “open science” research, and by checking excessive incursions of claims to private property rights over material that would otherwise remain in the public domain of scientific data and information.",2584665884,Paul A.

By removing barriers to online data and encouraging publication in Open Access formats and Open Data archives, OS seeks to expand the role, reach and value of research. The promises of OS imply a set of expectations about what different publics hope to gain from research, how accountability and participation can be enhanced, and what makes science public in the first place. This paper presents empirical material from fieldwork undertaken in (bio)chemistry laboratories in Kenya and South Africa to examine the extent to which these ideals can be realized in a sub-Saharan context. To analyse the challenges African researchers face in making use of freely available data, we draw from Amartya Sen’s Capabilities Approach.

When researchers respond to specific requests for information or materials, potential future reciprocity is weighed against the current loss of competitiveness, while general sharing intermediate results in an open forum is driven by the need for feedback versus potential misappropriation. We formally model these trade-offs and empirically test for differences using a survey of German and UK bio-scientists. Increased competition has a negative impact on sharing in both contexts. But career stage has an effect only on specific sharing with untenured faculty less likely to share. Further, scientists in larger teams are more likely to share specifically, but less likely to share generally. The importance of patents for one's reputation reduces sharing in both contexts, but the effect is greater for general information sharing.",2062945787; 2637863313; 1966567966; 2311598555,Carolin Haeussler; Lin Jiang; Jerry G.

Open source, open content and open access are also the most tangible result of the shift towards e-Science and digital networking. Yet, widespread misperceptions exist about the impact of this shift on knowledge distribution and scientific publishing. It is argued, on the one hand, that for the academy there principally is no digital dilemma surrounding copyright and there is no contradiction between open science and the knowledge-based economy if profits are made from nonexclusive rights. On the other hand, pressure for the `digital doubling' of research articles in Open Access repositories (the `green road') is misguided and the current model of Open Access publishing (the `gold road') has not much future outside biomedicine. Commercial publishers must understand that business models based on the transfer of copyright have not much future either. Digital technology and its economics favour the severance of distribution from certification. What is required of universities and governments, scholars and publishers, is to clear the way for digital innovations in knowledge distribution and scholarly publishing by enabling the emergence of a competitive market that is based on nonexclusive rights. This requires no change in the law but merely an end to the praxis of copyright transfer and exclusive licensing. The best way forward for research organisations, universities and scientists is the adoption of standard copyright licenses that reserve some rights, namely Attribution and No Derivative Works, but otherwise will allow for the unlimited reproduction, dissemination and re-use of the research article, commercial uses included.",2300160910,Chris Armbruster

This paper aims to present empirical evidence on the opinion and behaviour of French scientists (senior management level) regarding open access (OA) to scientific and technical information.

Design/methodology/approach
The results are part of a nationwide survey on scientific information and documentation with 432 directors of French public research laboratories conducted by the French National Research Center (CNRS) in 2014.

Findings
The CNRS senior research managers (laboratory directors) globally share the positive opinion towards OA revealed by other studies with researchers from the UK, Germany, the USA and other countries. However, they are more supportive of open repositories (green road) than of OA journal publishing (gold). The response patterns reveal a gap between generally positive opinions about OA and less supportive behaviours, principally publishing articles with article processing charges (APCs). A small group of senior research managers does not seem to be interested in green or gold OA and reluctant to self-archiving and OA publishing. Similar to other studies, the French survey confirms disciplinary differences, i.e. a stronger support for self-archiving of records and documents in HAL by scientists from Mathematics, Physics and Informatics than from Biology, Earth Sciences and Chemistry; and more experience and positive feelings with OA publishing and payment of APCs in Biology than in Mathematics or in Social Sciences and Humanities. Disciplinary differences and specific French factors are discussed, in particular in the context of the new European policy in favour of Open Science.

Originality/value
For the first time, a nationwide survey was conducted with the senior research management level from all scientific disciplines. The response rate was high (>30 per cent), and the results provide good insight into the real awareness, support and uptake of OA by senior research managers who provide both models (examples for good practice) and opinion leadership.",2763989043; 2652296235; 2666312523; 2293227608,Joachim Schöpfel; Coline Ferrant; Francis Andre; Renaud Fabre

However, institutional support for Teaching-Focussed academics is often limited, both in terms of peer networking and opportunities for career development. As four early-career stage Teaching-Focussed academics working in a variety of institutions, we explore what motivated our choices to make teaching our primary academic activity, and the challenges that we have faced in doing so. In addition to highlighting the need for universities to fully recognise the achievements of teaching staff, we discuss the role that the various biosciences learned societies have in supporting Teaching-Focussed academics. We identify that there is a need for the learned societies to come together and pool their expertise in this area. The fragmented nature of the Teaching-Focussed academic community means that clear sources of national support are needed in order to best enable the next generation of bioscience educators to reach their full potential.",2156641043; 2592837300; 2497454765; 2005192378,Katharine E.

This initiative, part of the larger institutional transformations initiated in response to the economic ramifications of rapid progress in digital information technologies, poses numerous contentious issues in law and economics. These are likely to create ambiguities for business and non-profit activities in this area for years to come, and the terms on which those issues are resolved will materially affect the costs and organizational feasibility of scientific projects that are of global reach and significance. This is the case especially in fields such as geology, oceanography and climatology, which depend heavily upon the collection, management and analysis of large volumes of observational data that cannot be regenerated. More generally the conduct of open, collaborative science – along with many of the benefits that flow from it for the developed and the developing economies alike – may be seriously jeopardized by the consequences of the new database protections. This raises the spectre of a new and different “tragedy of the commons,” one created by continuing the unbalanced pressure to extract greater economic rents by means of controlling access to information. “Over-fencing,” which is to say, the erection of artificial cost barriers to the production of reliable public knowledge by means of reliable public knowledge, threatens the future of “the public knowledge commons” that historically has proved critically important for rapid advance in science and technology. The paper sets out the economic case for the effectiveness of open, collaborative research, and the forces behind the recent, countervailing rush to strengthen and expand the scope of intellectual property rights protection. Focusing upon innovations in copyright law and the sui generis protection of hitherto unprotected content, it documents the genesis and analyzes the economic implications of the EC’s Database Directive, and related legislative proposals (H.R. 3125, H.R. 354 and H.R. 1858) in the US. The discussion concludes by advancing a number of modest remedial proposals that are intended to promoted greater efforts to arrive at satisfactory policy solutions for this aspect of “the digital dilemma.”",2584665884,Paul A.

This is a well-done study, and the conclusions follow from the results. We would recommend accepting the article once all clarifications and revisions have been made, or the lack of doing so adequately justified.

A. While brevity is generally to be admired, we would recommend a bit more detail about the statistical analyses. These are critical, but are reduced to 3 sentences and a referral to the programming language through an external link. We would suggest that the main text include the (brief) discussion of the analyses done, and rationale for them, rather than have those relegated to the external link.

B. The interpretation of the findings seems to be attributing causal factors - an A leads to B consideration - for which the control of variables is too limited. We believe that interpreting these as associations would be more consistent with the findings.

Consider the statement: ""Journals and editors should also think carefully about the optimum number of peer reviewers per paper. With each extra reviewer, we found that an extra 7.4 days are added to the review process."" Given that there appeared to be no inclusion of either article quality or complexity in the evaluation, is it not possible that issues within the article itself required the use of additional reviewers (i.e. a B leads to A perspective)? Perhaps extra reviewers with specific expertise was required, or concerns with potential problems in the manuscript led to consultations with other reviewers. It does not seem safe to assume that it was the addition of the reviewer that added extra days.

Similarly, the study centers around the role of the editor in the reviewing process, and the discussion suggested that the involvement of the reviewing editor as a peer reviewer expedited the process. There was little discussion of other factors that could have accounted for the statistical results. For example, perhaps the reviewing editor selected articles that piqued his or her interest, or were more clearly presented. Perhaps the reviewing editor selected to review at times more convenient to his or her workload, while other reviewers did not have such an option. The reviewing editor might select to review articles perceived to be of greater or timelier value to the journal itself, which may increase the speed of the review. 

Specific questions:

A. According to their method section, the authors state that they began with an initial N=9,589. After purging other articles they had an N=8,905. They then isolated a total of 2,750 articles subjected to the peer review process for the study: ""For the rest of the paper, we focus our analysis on this subset of 2,750 papers, of which 1,405 had been accepted, 1,099 had been rejected, and the rest [which would equal 246] were still under consideration.""

Looking at the Excel spreadsheet for citation counts, there are 1407 lines with entry numbers. For peer-reviewed papers, excel spreadsheet has 2747 (after removing duplicate entries based on the MS NO column) entries for manuscripts numbered up to 12621. The excel spreadsheet for unique reviewers has 2747 entries, with a final MS NO of 12621.

The numbers do not appear to match, and there is no explanation for that in methods. Exactly how many manuscripts were reviewed, how many rejected and why, and how many were tracked?

B. In the Excel spreadsheet for citations, the second column was titled ""Citations,"" but these figures do not appear to have any relation to the Scopus citation numbers. What numbers were used for the actual citation counts?

We also note that we find the suggestions by other reviewers compelling, and would be happy to review a revision of this manuscript should that be considered useful.

We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.",2619637082; 1809056843; 2699717977; 2303549338,Marco Giordan; Attila Csikász-Nagy; Andrew M.

Cheminformatics developers often need to choose between “mainstream” (i.e., accepted, expected) and novel, leading-edge tools, with an increasing trend for open science. Possible futures for cheminformatics include the worst case scenario (lack of funding, no creative usage), as well as the best case scenario (complete integration, from systems biology to virtual physiology). As “-omics” technologies advance, and computer hardware improves, compounds will no longer be profiled at the molecular level, but also in terms of genetic and clinical effects. Among potentially novel tools, we anticipate machine learning models based on free text processing, an increased performance in environmental cheminformatics, significant decision-making support, as well as the emergence of robot scientists conducting automated drug discovery research. Furthermore, cheminformatics is anticipated to expand the frontiers of knowledge and evolve in an open-ended, extensible manner, allowing us to explore multiple research scenarios in order to avoid epistemological “local information minimum trap”.",2437884320; 1103498097; 2031199245,Tudor I.

The transcripts of those lectures were published as a book entitled Crisis in Communication: The Functions and Future of Medical Journals two years later. In the book, Fox makes a stark prediction: “A day will come when journals will be superseded as a means of publishing new research.” (FOX, 1965). As the fiftieth anniversary of the book’s publication draws near, it is worth reassessing Fox’s prediction. Will journals be superseded 50 years from now? At first glance that seems unlikely. The first scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions, was published in 1665. Three centuries later, when Fox wrote Crisis in Communication, there were 6,000 medical journals in existence. Now, Scopus, one of the largest indexes of scholarly output, includes around 21,000 journals in its database: it has indexed 21 million articles published between 1823 and 1996, and a further 33 million records published within the last two decades. Indeed, according to a recent analysis, scientific output continues to increase by around 8-9% per year (BORNMANN; MUTZ, 2014). This increase in the number of articles is often at the expense of quality, with many papers never being cited. According to one estimate, as many as 12% of papers in the clinical sciences, and 27% of papers in the life sciences, are not cited within 5 years of publication (REMLER, 2014). The drivers for this are clear — academics feel pressured to publish as many papers as possible in order to get tenure and to secure new research funding. Furthermore, the huge volumes of papers being published also puts pressure on the academic community in other ways: readers are struggling to keep up with the literature; and many journals are finding it increasingly hard to secure the services of qualified peer reviewers to judge the suitability of papers for publication. The process of doing science is also changing. Not so long ago, single-author papers were considered to be essential for career advancement, as they demonstrated the ability to do research independently. More recently, large-scale collaborations are the order of the day, with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of researchers collaborating on expensive, international scientific studies. Jim Gray, a computer scientist, identified this shift in the scientific method calling it ‘the fourth paradigm’. In his words (GRAY, 2007, p. xix): The world of science has changed, and there is no question about this. The new model is for the data to be captured by instruments or generated by simulations before being processed by software and for the resulting information or knowledge to be stored in computers. Scientists only get to look at their data fairly late in this pipeline. The techniques and technologies for such data-intensive science are so different that it is worth distinguishing data-intensive science from computational science as a new, fourth paradigm for scientific exploration. Even small-scale studies often generate large amounts of data, and making these data discoverable and reusable is becoming an increasingly important priority for the scientific community. The rise of the open science movement, in which both the raw data and final publication are made available for easy access and reuse, has opened up opportunities for scientific-data-hosting companies like Figshare and Dryad, as well as for open-access ‘mega-journals’ like PLoS One and Scientific Reports. However, open-access journals, which generate revenue by charging authors an ‘article processing charge’ (APC) to publish their paper, have the potential to make the problem worse, not better, by making it easier for authors to publish their work. Fox considered journal publishing to be in crisis 50 years ago, but the crisis in communication is arguably far worse now than it was then (FOX, 1965). Funders and academic institutions need to address the current crisis in two ways. First, they need to reward scientists for the quality, not quantity, of the work that they publish; surrogate markers of quality, such as journal impact factors, are widely perceived to be imperfect ways of judging an individual scientist’s research output and new metrics are urgently needed. Second, funders and institutions should encourage their researchers to publish much of their work in repositories. These standardized reports would not necessarily be read by human beings, but rather would hold data and data descriptors in a form that is machine-readable to allow accurate indexing and meta-analysis by computers. There are early signs that such an approach would be feasible, but it will take time to change 350 years of academic culture. How long, exactly, remains to be seen. After all, as Niels Bohr so eloquently put it: “it is very difficult to predict — especially the future” (MENCHER, 1971, p. 37). - Figshare and Scientific Reports, which are mentioned in this article, are part of Macmillan Science and Education, the author’s employer. The views expressed here are personal and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Macmillan Science and Education.",2538499870,James Butcher

In fact, such feisty discussion (occasionally attempting to become rough) is a well recognized characteristic almost entirely connected to the Christian West, being not so obvious in the Christian East. Thus, one might be under the impression that the East is lagging behind the West considering the ever open Science vs. Christian Faith Debate. However, it would not only be unfair but also erroneous to label the phenomenon as being the product of the alleged inferiority of the Orthodox theology. Indeed, some influential Orthodox theologians hold a position that the problem was entirely initiated and propelled by and within the scholastic thought of the West, eventually transforming itself into a foundation of a new positive philosophy unwilling or even unable to accept the truth(s) that cannot be rationally verified. However, such a phenomenon seems entirely unknown (or even impossible) for the Christian East. Therefore, it seems important to understand the reasons behind it and analyze their influence. This essay is a modest attempt to shed light on the subject as being contemplated by a scholar (and a believer himself) dealing professionally with the achievements of a positive science such as genetics.",2639278360,Petar Tomev Mitrikeski

In the face of an increasing policy demand for quantitative methodologies to assess societal impact, social media data (altmetrics) has been presented as a potential method to capture broader forms of impact. However, current altmetric indicators were extrapolated from traditional citation approaches and are seen as problematic for assessing societal impact. In contrast, established qualitative methodologies for societal impact assessment are based on interaction approaches. These argue that assessment should focus on mapping the contexts in which engagement among researchers and stakeholders takes place, as a means to understand the pathways to societal impact. Following these interaction approaches, we propose to shift the use of altmetric data towards network analysis of researchers and stakeholders. We carry out two case studies, analysing researchers’ networks with Twitter data. The comparison illustrates the potential of Twitter networks to capture disparate degrees of policy engagement. We propose that this mapping method can be used as an input within broader methodologies in case studies of societal impact assessment.",563251871; 1911358670; 343224479,Nicolás Robinson-García; Thed N. van Leeuwen; Ismael Rafols

From the early days of development, research libraries have joined different networks and been among the most active stakeholders working towards open science. Cohesive networks are needed for coordinated actions and support, whereas bridging networks can provide new approaches and novel information. The Finnish Open Science and Research Initiative is presented in this paper as an example of joining networks, motivating individuals and organisations to deliver high-quality services, infrastructures and competence building to promote a transition towards open science. This paper also presents milestones such as the publication of the academic publishing costs of Finnish research organisations and the maturity level of open science operating cultures in HEIs. Based on the experience of the Finnish open science initiative, joining different networks at the national level on an open mode of operation can significantly speed up the transition towards the era of open science.",2569742387,Riitta Maijala

We posit that cyberinfrastructure should reinforce scientific norms, such as transparency and reproducibility, while embedding and encouraging best practices in scientific research, such as citation. Finally, we believe cyberinfrastucture should consider the entire soup-to-nuts discovery pipeline, even if focusing only on a subset of the workflow. In this article, we develop these ideas in the context of the ResearchCompendia project. ResearchCompendia is designed to facilitate reproducibility in computational science by persistently linking data and code that generated published findings to the article, and executing the code in the cloud to validate or certify those findings. We conclude with a discussion of the future vision of cyberinfrastructure and ResearchCompendia in support of science.",2602354082; 2014791453; 2222273294,Victoria C.

It pursues a different approach, applying functionalism in historical context to explain the emergence of the characteristic ethos and institutions of 'open science'. The emergence during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries of the idea and practice of 'open science' represented a break from the previously dominant ethos of secrecy in the pursuit of 'Nature's secrets'. It was a distinctive and vital organizational aspect of the scientific revolution, from which crystallized a new set of norms, incentives and organizational structures that reinforced scientific researchers' commitments to rapid disclosure of new knowledge. To understand how this came about, it is necessary to examine the economics of patronage and the roles of asymmetric information and reputation in the early modern reorganization of scientific activities. The rise of 'cooperative rivalries' in the revelation of new knowledge is seen as a functional response to heightened asymmetric information problems posed for the Renaissance system of court patronage of the arts and sciences; pre-existing informational asymmetries had been exacerbated by increased importance of mathematics and the greater reliance upon sophisticated mathematical techniques in a variety of practical contexts of application. Analysis of the court patronage system of late Renaissance Europe, within which the new natural philosophers found their support, points to the significance of the feudal legacy of fragmented political authority in creating conditions of 'common agency contracting in substitutes'. These conditions are shown to have been conducive to more favorable contract terms (especially with regard to autonomy and financial support) for the agent--client members of western Europe's nascent scientific communities. Some lessons may be drawn for contemporary science and technology policy debates, in which the open science mode of pursuing knowledge often seems to be viewed a robust concomitant of the power of scientific research techniques--whereas it is a fragile cultural legacy of western Europe's history, upon which rests the ascendancy of modern science as a driver of long-term economic growth.

Researchers are generally supportive of data sharing and publication but they often lack incentives and mechanisms to share data effectively. For open data to help increase scientific reproducibility and reliability it must be more than just available – it should be understandable and reusable and, ideally, validated through peer review. Data journals and data articles have emerged as a new type of publication to help address these issues. Nature Publishing Group has developed a data journal in response to the needs of research funders and a survey of key stakeholders. The journal, Scientific Data, published its first articles in May 2014. The primary article type, the Data Descriptor, combines traditional scientific article content with structured machine-readable information, and has been devised to enable searching across different data types, linking of data to publications, and data-mining.",2519180629; 2519799178,イアン ヒリナスキエヴィッチ; 新谷 洋子

The popularity of R has grown rapidly over the past two decades and the number of users and packages is increasing at a near exponential rate. This rapid growth has prompted a number of formal and informal online and text resources, the volume of which is beginning to present challenges to novices learning R. Students are often first exposed to R in upper division undergraduate classes or during their graduate studies. The way R is presented likely has consequences for the fundamental understanding of the program and language itself; user comprehension of R may be better if learning the language itself followed by conducting analyses, compared to someone who is learning another subject (e.g. statistics) using R for the first time. Consequently, an understanding of the approaches to R education is critical. Methods: To establish how students are exposed to R, we used a survey to evaluate the current use in Canadian university courses, including the context in which R is presented and the types of uses of R in the classroom. Additionally, we looked at the reasons professors either do or don’t use/teach R. Results: We found that R is used in a broad range of course disciplines beyond statistics (e.g. ecology) and just over one half of Canadian universities have at least one course that uses R. Discussion and Conclusions: Developing programming-literate students is of utmost importance and our hope is that this benchmark study will influence how post-secondary educators, as well as other programmers, approach R, specifically when developing educational and supplemental content in online, text, and package-specific formats aiding in student’s comprehension of the R language.",2507912584; 2698264513,Michael A.

Whereas Jean-Claude Guedon has been a professor of Literature in North-America for many years and part of the open access movements since its beginning, Thomas Wiben Jensen is in the early part of his carreer and fairly new to the concept of open access.  The conversation begins with a focus on the Danish national strategy for open access and this strategy's consquenses for the journal NyS where Thomas Wiben is part of the editorial board. However, the conversation brings the reader on an unexpected journey through the history of science communication and through alternative ways of understanding knowledge production as frozen moments or crystals in the Great Conversation of science. It is the hope of the editor and the contributors that the conversation can lead to a debate about innovative ways of communicating and distributing scientific results.",2603393705; 2124442824; 2578641616,Niels Stern; Jean-Claude Guédon; Thomas Wiben Jensen

Longo and Drazen in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) 1 has stirred up quite a bit of controversy. As Executive Officers of the International Society of Computational Biology, Inc. (ISCB), we express our deep concern about the restrictive and potentially damaging opinions voiced in this editorial, and while ISCB works to write a detailed response, we felt it necessary to promptly address the editorial with this response. While some of the concerns voiced by the authors of the editorial are worth considering, large parts of the statement purport an obsolete view of hegemony over data that is neither in line with today’s spirit of open access nor further an atmosphere where the potential of data can be fully realized.

ISCB acknowledges that the additional comment on the editorial 2 eases some of the polemics, but unfortunately without addressing some of the core issues. We still feel that we need to contrast the opinion voiced in the editorial with what we consider to be the axioms of our scientific society. We feel the following statements would lead to a more fruitful future of data-driven science:

• Data produced with public money should be public for the benefit of science and society
• Restrictions to the use of public data hamper science and slow progress
• Open data is the best way to combat fraud and misinterpretations


Current large data collections proceed from many sources, are continually accumulated, and require a variety of analytical approaches. Data generation and data analysis overlap in time and are continually updated with new data sets produced by new techniques and new analysis methodologies. Furthermore, in many cases current science functions in consortia in which scientists collaborate toward common goals while preserving their own scientific objectives. Dividing scientists into data providers and data analysts is simplistic and gives a misleading impression of the actual state of biological and biomedical science.

ISCB very much supports collaboration between disciplines, including experimental and clinical disciplines as well as bioinformatics, as the best way forward to address complex biological problems. But this collaboration cannot be based on imposed restrictions to data access and cannot be contained in professional silos. (The use of expressions such as “research parasites” clearly does not help.)

In this spirit, ISCB recently launched the ISCB Community Journal (ISCB Comm J), which is published on the F1000Research publishing platform. F1000Research and ISCB Comm J have a robust data sharing policy. All primary research articles include the submission of the data underlying the results, together with details of any software used to process results.

Many bio-communities have made significant progress by endorsing open data policies and, gratefully, public funding agencies have connected to the spirit that they are distributing taxpayers’ money to science and that, therefore, the data that are generated in the course belong to the public. It is, perhaps, natural that some areas of biomedical research are slow in adopting these policies. History and the confidential nature of the relevant data are surely some of the reasons. However, in our opinion, data hegemony is another reason and this has to be overcome. The sooner these barriers to progress are removed the sooner patients will benefit from the current flourishing of biomedical research.",2524334304; 2311621257; 320861845; 2033967891; 128580411; 2315546843; 2116993377,Alfonso Valencia; Scott Markel; Bruno A.

Consequently, researchers’ activities can become dislocated from the needs their societies. Valeria Arza and Emanuel Lopez explain how embedding open science practices in research evaluation systems can help address this problem and ensure research retains local relevance.

This project, being a part of the Open Science and Research Initiative in Finland (ATT), proceeds via two subprojects. First, the platform for editing and publishing OA journals are improved. Second, a new consortium based funding model for Finnish OA journals will be created. Kotilava is closely related to another ATT initiative run by The National Library of Finland, TAJUA, which aims to further improve OA repository services and guidance on best practices that the National Library already provides. It also develops tools for creating metadata for research datasets. This poster focuses on the funding model of Kotilava. Most Finnish academic journals are published in print by small scholarly societies. They have limited resources to carry out all the tasks needed in turning to immediate OA. Yet, this transformation has to happen. Researchers need to see their contribution distributed as soon and as widely as possible; also the funders require the results of the research they finance to be published in OA.   Currently, the most common way of funding OA journals are Article Processing Charges (APCs). The difficulties of this model are well known, two of the major ones being that an APC based model is not appropriate for small language areas like Finland nor for all fields of research. Thus, alternative funding models are discussed worldwide. Especially consortium based systems, such as the Open Library of Humanities’ and Knowledge Unlatched’s models, have been of interest. So far the income of Finnish journals has consisted of sales, subventions from societies, government subsidies, and, occasionally, from subsidies by research institutions. Publishing in immediate OA decreases the income from these conventional sources of funding. Clearly, the transformation to immediate OA cannot be financed without substitutive funding. Domestic journals provide the definitive forum to publish research on national culture, history and society. It is in the best interest of all the actors in the field from research organizations and funders to scholarly publishers to guarantee the existence of these publishing channels also in the future. The aims of Kotilava are: determining the criteria the journals should meet (e.g. technical and bibliographical requirements); calculating the income needed to fund immediate OA; outlining the criteria how an article based fee is determined in different types of journals; negotiating with the possible funders and the journals; and proposing a system for collecting the funds to the consortia and for distributing it to the journals with minimum transaction costs. Tasks 1, 2, and 3 are integrated with the part of Kotilava which aids the journals to meet the technical criteria of OA publishing. During summer 2016, a group of 12 journals has begun to examine the possibilities of creating the new funding model in practice.",2536595239,Riitta Koikkalainen

The correlation of phenotypic outcomes with genetic variation and environmental factors is a core pursuit in biology and biomedicine. Numerous challenges impede our progress: patient phenotypes may not match known diseases, candidate variants may be in genes that have not been characterized, model organisms may not recapitulate human or veterinary diseases, filling evolutionary gaps is difficult, and many resources must be queried to find potentially significant genotype-phenotype associations. Nonhuman organisms have proven instrumental in revealing biological mechanisms. Advanced informatics tools can identify phenotypically relevant disease models in research and diagnostic contexts. Large-scale integration of model organism and clinical research data can provide a breadth of knowledge not available from individual sources and can provide contextualization of data back to these sources. The Monarch Initiative (monarchinitiative.org) is a collaborative, open science effort that aims to semantically integrate genotype-phenotype data from many species and sources in order to support precision medicine, disease modeling, and mechanistic exploration.

Abstract: Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) is the largest and authoritative international source of information about open journals. Polish open access journals are indexed there from the very beginning of DOAJ. In 2015, the catalog's editorial board prepared new guidelines for indexing journals. Consequence of this move was preparation of the new application and reapplication form. The article gives the review for the changes in all application forms that occurred since the beginning of DOAJ. It also contains most important guidelines for journals publishers and editorial boards who are applying to DOAJ according to new rules. Part of the paper is also devoted to good practices related to the openness of journals and scientific publications accepted in the DOAJ.",2782742590,Natalia Pamuła-Cieślak

What are the differences between scientists’ and other online groups’ preferred modes of governing knowledge creation? A distinction is drawn between constituted and adaptive modes of governance and similarities and differences between the two groups’ understandings of information curation and verification and openness are considered. It is suggested that open science will need to become more flexible if it is to build collaborations with loosely connected groups on equitable terms that respect their respective values and in ways that maximise the contributions of these groups to social problem solving.,2740889978,Robin Mansell

According to a leg­end, a soldier named Pheidippides (more likely Philippides) dropped dead after run­ning from war-torn Marathon to Athens with the news of victory. Millennia later, we do not know whether he was a soldier or a courier, or whether he really ran the entire 240 km from Athens to Sparta and then back from Marathon to Athens. What is clear however, is that his death went down in history as the first documented exercise-related death and provides a tangible starting-point for the discipline of sport cardiology.

Sports cardiology today covers a broad range of areas; from patients with cardiomyopathies, coronary disease and metabolic syndrome through to fitness fans, high-performance athletes and those with physically demanding professions.

The following editorial introduces the primary topics for discussion to be included in the F1000Research channel Sports cardiology with the hope that this will evoke open, controversial and broad discourse in the form of reviews and original research papers in this important field.",2582076491,Roman Leischik

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested, hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.",694941507; 2135119392; 2461426400; 35839684; 2114205661; 2641644067; 2440085956; 1983462160; 2524891893; 2169498007; 2734815834; 306386534; 2736085150; 2735414064; 1734670822; 2697327829; 2002445749; 2734409999; 233116180; 2689645911; 323584109; 2048831940; 2669709405; 1994166799; 2149895133; 2625844308; 2107023727; 2225648870; 2501822737; 2647319559; 2736593139; 328456269; 2650729799; 1962687673; 2736016483; 2124014511; 1967671111; 2736047377; 2735699363; 2661564358; 2728391742; 2785577338; 2779155956; 2780041811; 2613839543,Nicolas P.

Researchers will have to adapt to new possibilities to new tools and to new responsibilities. The innovation ecosystem will also change by embracing more openness and being more inclusive. Funders, academic institutions and policy makers will need to fund, inform, and legislate to accelerate the transition.Open Science practices are breaking barriers that prevent the free flow of knowledge produced by researchers. The adoption of such practices is bound to redefine the relationships between the stakeholders of research ecosystem and between researchers and society.In this paper I studied about Open Science include Open Access, Open Data and Open Collaboration.

For scientific software, however, this is less often the case. Most scientific software is written by only a few authors, often a student working on a thesis. Once the paper describing the tool has been published, the tool is no longer developed further and is left to its own device. Here we describe the broad, multidisciplinary community we formed around a set of tools for statistical genomics. The GenABEL project for statistical omics actively promotes open interdisciplinary development of statistical methodology and its implementation in efficient and user-friendly software under an open source licence. The software tools developed withing the project collectively make up the GenABEL suite, which currently consists of eleven tools. The open framework of the project actively encourages involvement of the community in all stages, from formulation of methodological ideas to application of software to specific data sets. A web forum is used to channel user questions and discussions, further promoting the use of the GenABEL suite. Developer discussions take place on a dedicated mailing list, and development is further supported by robust development practices including use of public version control, code review and continuous integration. Use of this open science model attracts contributions from users and developers outside the “core team”, facilitating agile statistical omics methodology development and fast dissemination.",865189202; 2767505978; 2476693674,Lennart C.

In response to the EPSRC expectations, the University of Bath developed a Research Data Archive for researchers to archive and share their data. This was developed using the institutional repository software, EPrints. EPrints has a flexible approach to metadata, so developing a metadata schema for use in the Archive was a significant task.

The National Digital Stewardship Residency (NDSR) project, Foundations to Actions: Extending Innovations in Digital Libraries in Partnership with NDSR Learners has 5 geographically distributed partners, each mentoring a resident. The goal is to plan a next-generation digital library and tools based on user priorities, using BHL as a test-bed for incorporating transcriptions, image searching, collection analysis and connections among museums, archives and biodiversity databases.

Expanding Access to Biodiversity Literature positions BHL as an on-ramp to the national digital library infrastructure, the Digital Public Library of America (DPLA). Partners provide tools, support, including training, copyright permissions and dollars, to enable small content providers to contribute via BHL to DPLA. 

Finally, Zooniverse (which builds and hosts citizen science projects) developed Science Gossip as an investigation into the communication of science by images in both the Victorian period and today. Images in BHL are tagged using crowdsourcing, for better access and a better understanding of the range of individuals who established early science.",2659499382; 2547590474,Constance Rinaldo; Jane Smith

Consumers of shared data range from people interested in validating the results of a given study to transformers of the data. These transformers can add value to the dataset by extracting new relationships and information. The relationship between producers and consumers can be modeled in a game-theoretic context, namely by using a Prisoners' Dilemma (PD) model to better understand potential barriers and benefits of sharing. In this paper, we will introduce the problem of data sharing, consider assumptions about economic versus social payoffs, and provide a game-theoretic model of data sharing. Several variations on the payoff matrix are given for different institutional scenarios, ranging from the ubiquitous acceptance of Open Science principles to a context where the standard is entirely non-cooperative. Implications for building a CC-BY economy are then discussed in context.",2308134321,Bradly Alicea

A necessary bridge that can support not only to a higher visibility and institutionalization of HD within universities but also encourages synergy with other realities aligned with public/open science, civic design, open data and co-creation. We go over discussions inherent to current tensions and new ways of understanding knowledge that will be useful to contextualize the jostling or organizational multipurpose tools within the Digital Humanities, we also perform a particular analysis taking into account the various forms of laboratories in pre-digital and digital versions and their impact and implementation by digital humanists.

We argue that open institutions, in whatever forms, are essentially about decentralized production of a collective good (or “commons”) that relies on voluntary collaboration of highly variable human-related input. In addition to providing a general definition of open institutional structure, we submit there are two necessary conditions for open institutions. The first is the integration of consumers into production. The second condition is that the efficiency gain from “production” commons is the objective and the tragedy of anticommons becomes a serious problem.

We trace back almost 30 years of history across selected user facilities illustrating the evolution of facility data management practices and how these practices have related to performing scientific research. The facilities cover multiple techniques such as X-ray and neutron scattering, imaging and tomography sciences. Over time, detector and data acquisition technologies have dramatically increased the ability to produce prolific volumes of data challenging the traditional paradigm of users taking data home upon completion of their experiments to process and publish their results. During this time, computing capacity has also increased dramatically, though the size of the data has grown significantly faster than the capacity of one's laptop to manage and process this new facility produced data. Trends indicate that this will continue to be the case for yet some time. Thus users face a quandary for how to manage today's data complexity and size as these may exceed the computing resources users have available to themselves. This same quandary can also stifle collaboration and sharing. Realizing this, some facilities are already providing web portal access to data and computing thereby providing users access to resources they need [2]. Portal based computing is now driving researchers to think about how to use the data collected at multiple facilities in an integrated way to perform their research, and also how to collaborate and share data. In the future, inter-facility data management systems will enable next tier cross-instrument-cross facility scientific research fuelled by smart applications residing upon user computer resources. We can learn from the medical imaging community that has been working since the early 1990's to integrate data from across multiple modalities to achieve better diagnoses [3] – similarly, data fusion across BES facilities will lead to new scientific discoveries.",2103422978; 2498800581; 2156841754; 2077581545; 2140303920; 2151101088; 2627521066; 2655718564; 2641260906; 2063443187; 1217962163,Stephen D Miller; Paul S.

Is it about providing clear and transparent access to knowledge objects: data, theories and knowledge (open access, open data, open methods, open knowledge)? Is it about providing similar access to knowledge acquisition processes (open science)? Obviously it is; however, this is not the whole story. Open approaches require active engagement. This is not just engagement from the ‘usual suspects’ but engagement from a broader societal base. For example, primary data creators need the appropriate incentives to provide access to Open Data – these incentives will vary between different groups: contract archaeologists, curatorial archaeologists and research archaeologists all have different drivers. Equally important is that open approaches raise a number of issues about data a...",2692126887; 2779817660,Anthony Beck; Cameron Neylon

These datasets, both new and legacy, are often structured in a manner that is not conducive to storage and cataloging with modern data handling systems and large file archive facilities. In this paper we discuss in detail how we have created a robust toolset and simple portal into the Fermilab archive facilities, which allows for scientific data to be quickly imported, organized and retrieved from the multi-petabyte facility.In particular we discuss how the data from the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) for the COUPP dark matter detector was aggregated, cataloged, archived and re-organized to permit it to be retrieved and analyzed using modern distributed computing resources both at Fermilab and on the Open Science Grid. We pay particular attention to the methods that were employed to uniquify the namespaces for the data, derive metadata for the over 460,000 image series taken by the COUP experiment and what was required to map that information into coherent datasets that could be stored and retrieved using the large scale archives systems.We describe the data transfer and cataloging engines that are used for data importation and how these engines have been setup to import data from the data acquisition systems of ongoing experiments at non-Fermilab remote sites including the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso and the Ash River Laboratory in Orr, Minnesota. We also describe how large University computing sites around the world are using the system to store and retrieve large volumes of simulation and experiment data for physics analysis.",2122956178; 2559306830; 2557552894; 2775899577; 2344158614,A.

A particular focus of this study was the manner in which these students merge the world of school science with their social world to create a hybrid space by appropriating knowledge and resources of the school and home. Within this hybrid space they experienced a deeper, more meaningful and authentic engagement in science practical work. This hybrid space redefined the landscape of the science learning experience for these students, as they could derive the twofold benefit of appropriating support when necessary and at the same time maintain their autonomy over the investigation. For South Africa and quite probably other countries; these findings serve as a guideline as to how opportunities can be created for students to do open science investigations, against prevailing school factors such as large classes, a lack of physical resources, the lack of time for practical work and the demands of syllabus coverage.",708816495; 2141234255,Umesh Ramnarain; Josef de Beer

In this paper, we propose a new model that distinguishes the characteristics of the object, its ""state"", from the subjective ""standing"" granted to it by different communities. This provides a way to discuss the difference in practices between communities, which will deliver more productive conversations and facilitate negotiation on how to collectively improve the process of scholarly communications not only for preprints but other forms of scholarly contributions.",2556910074; 2581266050; 2278817147; 2101394917,Cameron Neylon; Damian Pattinson; Geoffrey Bilder; Jennifer Lin

This paper will first discuss what additional legal regulation may be required to allow full accessibility, which includes not only a legal authorization to perform certain rights, but also the technical possibility to effectively access and reuse material. Then, based on the example of attribution and authorship requirements for reproduction and performances of works and derivative works, it will be examined what technical infrastructure may better support the enforceability of these licensing terms, namely a framework automating certain actions and pedagogy tools. From legal accessibility to technical accessibility and technical support of open content licenses, this article illustrates the intricate relationship between law and technology in the realm of copyright and focuses on access and authorship, two fundamental elements of (free) culture and (open) science.",2653748040,Melanie Dulong de Rosnay

Digital delivery and storage have revolutionised the way in which data is captured, stored and made available for sharing. The presentation will look at the Royal Society's Report Science as an Open Enterprise to identify the challenges and opportunities that Open Science brings. The session will then look at the newly-produced LERU Roadmap for Research Data (launched in Brussels on 22 January 2014). The Roadmap makes over 40 recommendations for research-led universities on what they need to do to meet the challenges. The paper will conclude with an analysis of how UCL will meet these challenges.",2644488295,P Ayris

The latter are widely acknowledged to be critical for the sustained growth of knowledge-driven economies, but are most efficiently pursued in the “open science” mode. In some fields, informal cooperative norms of behavior among researchers– in regard to the sharing of timely access to raw data- steams and documented database resources – are being undermined by legal institutional innovations that accommodate the further privatising of the public domain in information. A variety of corrective measures are needed to restore proper balance to the IPR.",2584665884,Paul A. David

The critical care research community has responded admirably to these challenges by rigorously conducting numerous large and often multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of putative therapies for critical illnesses. Yet in spite of two decades of work, few incontrovertibly efficacious therapies have resulted from this herculean effort (1). The reasons for this are unsettled, but several categories of problems have emerged. The first problem is that of “positive” trials that cannot be replicated (2-15). Since the clinical trial is in essence a diagnostic test of a hypothesis (16), these non-replicable studies represent “false positives.” False positive trials are due to type I errors which are increased by selection of a conventional and lax statistical significance threshold (e.g., α=0.05) (17,18), bias in the study at any stage of design, conduct, analysis and reporting (19), and fraud (20). Recently, the center for open science collaboration demonstrated that the majority of 100 “positive” psychological research studies could not be replicated, suggesting a false positive rate of 63% in that field (21). The generalizability of this result to medicine is uncertain, but the problems of non-replicability and false positives are not.",2623435886,Scott Aberegg

These VOs have developed a plethora of tools that have been found useful to members of the OSG. Unfortunately it is hard for everyone in the OSG community to keep up with all the tools, and their accessibility; Similarly OSG support staff and resource administrators have been known to have a hard time debugging an issue related to a reported issue because of the distributed nature of various tools; Additionally, new collaborators have repeatedly complained that most of the tools on the OSG are hard to discover; and even after they discover a tool, the interface is not uniform, and requires them to learn a new interface and its data format. MyOSG addresses these concerns: The primary idea is to use an authoritative source of information about OSG entities as a backbone, and organize data from different tools around this backbone to create a web portal. Further, MyOSG provides the ability for users to export / subscribe to a variety of information in formats such as XML, UWA -- an industry standard widget format, iCal -- for calendar type information, and others. This enables a user to construct Individual Information Centers (IIC) on tools such as iGoogle, Netvibes, Opera Widgets, and on mobile devices such as iPhone, etc. In summary, MyOSG is a highly customizable web portal that allows vastly different categories of users to access information they find important to their role in a format that is convenient to them.",2130056952; 2140555764; 2302944078,Arvind Gopu; Soichi Hayashi; Rob Quick

They deal with four sets of issues: (i) setting a common framework, a general discussion of open data principles, values and opportunities; (ii) insights into scientific practices, a view of the way in which the open data movement is developing in a variety of scientific domains (biology, psychology, epidemiology and archaeology); (iii) a case study of human genomics, which was a trail-blazer in data sharing, and which encapsulates the tension that can occur between large-scale data sharing and one of the boundaries of openness, the protection of individual data; (iv) open science and the public, based on a round table discussion about the public communication of science and the societal implications of open science. There were three proposals for the planning of further interdisciplinary initiatives on open science. Firstly, there is a need to integrate top-down initiatives by governments, institutions and journals with bottom-up approaches from the scientific community. Secondly, more should be done to popularize the societal benefits of open science, not only in providing the evidence needed by citizens to draw their own conclusions on scientific issues that are of concern to them, but also explaining the direct benefits of data sharing in areas such as the control of infectious disease. Finally, introducing arguments from social sciences and humanities in the educational dissemination of open data may help students become more profoundly engaged with Open Science and look at science from a broader perspective.",1978554192; 2780591107; 2615904805; 2684419931; 2654490846; 2615572354; 2685575733; 1973107688; 2066956233; 2633197437; 2781296060; 2635241756; 2632668716; 2609886121; 2639218919,Giovanni Destro Bisol; Deborah Mascalzoni; Jennifer C.

The concept of transparency at all stages of the research process, coupled with free and open access to data, code, and papers, constitutes “open science.” Despite the many benefits of an open approach to science, a number of barriers to entry exist that may prevent researchers from embracing openness in their own work. Here we describe several key shifts in mindset that underpin the transition to more open science. These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public. Though foreign and perhaps frightening at first, these changes in thinking stand to benefit the field of ecology by fostering collegiality and broadening access to data and findings. We present an overview of tools and best practices that ...",1982583839; 89804679; 2317935602; 2558200899; 300215091; 2658340468; 2128082227; 2155549124; 2618688174; 2704337010; 2700221353; 2098531148; 2464314039; 2608916245; 2236251960,Stephanie E.

The NCSU Libraries has paired user research approaches with iterative design practice to determine contextually relevant services to support researchers.

This poster will showcase two case studies as examples of successful avenues of support through library services, the user research and application of frameworks that supported the development of these services, and the project management methodology that applied research to practice. Each case study will outline strategies used to develop services that support modern research practice through the investigation of a complex problem space.",2561743682; 2143688856; 2567255123,Ekatarina Grguric; Hilary M.

My game theory models are unique in that they account for three factors that previously have been overlooked in the literature: price elasticity of demand, the feasibility of open source production of a given technology product, and network effects. This analysis suggests that the focus of some ""open"" intellectual property advocates on direct efforts to enact open source and open access norms into law has in some respects been misplaced. Based on my game theory models, I propose several new approaches towards a more open intellectual property system, including an ""aperture"" model of patent disclosure and a ""regulatory"" framework for copyright in scientific publishing, which might represent a tighter fit with the political economy of intellectual property.",2343924790,David W.

On 17 th July 2015 the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts for Baden-Wuerttemberg, Germany, invited national experts to the presentation of the final report of the ‘bwFDM communities’ project. This 18 month project was launched at the beginning of 2014 to evaluate the needs of services and the support that libraries and IT service centres should offer researchers in the area of research data management. Full-time key project staff had been established at all 9 universities in the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg to conduct semi-structured personal interviews of all research groups working with research data (in a broad sense including all areas of science, social science and humanities) and to document them in the form of user stories. 627 interviews have been conducted and more than 2,500 user stories could be extracted, showing the wide range of needs and wishes articulated by researchers. On this basis issues of importance and requirements had be identified, categorised in 18 different groups and finalised into an analysis of the status quo and recommendations for concrete action plans. The results cover the areas ‘general requirements and policy framework’, ‘data collection and data sharing’, ‘technical framework and virtual research environments’, ‘preservation’,  ‘IT infrastructure and IT support’, ‘licencing’ and ‘Open Science’. The presentation will give an overview of the project results and will highlight the roles libraries and IT service centres are expected to play from the researcher´s point of view. As the final report to the Ministry contributes to a comprehensive research data management strategy for the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg, the presentation will also point out the status of the federal strategy in RDM.",2708100820,Karlheinz Pappenberger

Basic research may also lead to practical benefits, such as a new drug or diagnostic method.  Building on our previous study of basic biomedical and biological researchers at Harvard, we present findings from a new survey of similar scientists from three countries.  This survey asked about the scientists’ motivations, goals and perspectives along with their attitudes concerning  policies designed to increase both the practical (i.e. public health) benefits of basic research as well as their own personal satisfaction. Close to 900 basic investigators responded to the survey; results corroborate the main findings from the previous survey of Harvard scientists.  In addition, we find that most bioscientists disfavor present policies that require a discussion of the public health potential of their proposals in grants but generally favor softer policies aimed at increasing the quality of work and the potential practical benefits of basic research. In particular, bioscientists are generally supportive of those policies entailing the organization of more meetings between scientists and the general public, the organization of more academic discussion about the role of scientists in the society, and the implementation of a “basic bibliography” for each new approved drug.",41108871; 2531720121; 1851960627; 2116398261; 2202533312,Giorgio Scita; Carmen Sorrentino; Andrea Boggio; David Hemenway; Andrea Ballabeni

OS movement has largely adopted in European countries recently but in low middle income countries like Bangladesh OS activities are moving slowly. Realizing its importance for university and research potentiality, university libraries of Bangladesh permitting OA to their content for internal and external members. This research attempts to explore the extent of OS activities through OA repositories and provides necessary recommendation for future development in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach – This paper begins with an overview of intellectual capital management strategies currently being employed by universities. It moves into a discussion of the impact of open science instruments in research to establish more vibration in open methodology. It closes with a set of recommendation in implementing Open Science in university repositories and plans to ensure that the research output of the university remains accessible over the long term. Data have been collected through survey questionnaire in preparing PhD dissertation in Dhaka University during the year of 2013. Informal interview with the senior professionals in the filed were also conducted and other part of this article has been adapted through intensive literature review and observation. Findings – The result reveals the fact that most of the public/government and private university libraries have failed to meet the requirement of open science concept. Due to insignificant research and field based educational activities there are huge lacking in generation of sufficient number of electronic content. Existing intellectual capitals are managed with some kind of open sourced library software without maintaining minimum standard and policies country wide. In maximum cases content has been preserved for the internal use rather than ensuring open access to the external users. Research limitations/implications – Academic libraries in tertiary level of education fall into many categories in Bangladesh. These are degree awarding public/government and private universities and colleges under National Universities and Intuitions and Open University. This research concentrates on public/government and private university libraries leaving all other categories. Strategic sampling has been made from 130 universities though a larger numbers of sample could have been produced better result.

It also aimed to test the feasibility of an OECD global survey on science with a focus on major emerging policy issues. This online, email-based pilot survey was based on a stratified random sample of corresponding authors of publications listed in a major global scientific publication index across seven diverse, hand-picked science domains. The results provide evidence of the extent of journal and repository-based open access, data sharing practices, the link between different forms of open access to research and research impact, and the decoupling of quality assurance and access roles played by journals. The results point to the importance of considering economic incentives and social norms in developing policy options for open access. The findings also provide new insights on scientist careers, mobility and gender pay bias.",2530364699; 1981506320,Brunella Boselli; Fernando Galindo-Rueda

Whether or not managers should adopt such strategies or stick to more traditional, closed corporate models in the organization of R&D is a dilemma that remains poorly understood. This paper assesses the impact of open science strategies that involve the disclosure of corporate R&D findings through scientific publications on innovative performance and sets out conditions under which such strategies are more or less beneficial. We highlight that such strategies are especially beneficial in the development of radical (rather than incremental) innovations and if pursued in conjunction with R&D collaborations involving academic institutions. We empirically analyze a panel dataset of 160 UK therapeutic biotechnology firms over the period 1998-2009. Our results from count data models on the number of new products in development provide strong empirical support for our hypotheses.",2650662466,Simcha Jong

The main aim of the project has been to develop education in health sciences. The target group is the junior faculty from the Public Health departments, library and IT centers in the partner universities. Special emphasis has been placed on developing sustainable models in the information and knowledge management systems for education and research in all these institutions. Not only have we have utilized open-source systems and software as well as open science ideology but the project has also encouraged the partners’ junior professionals to actively to instigate changes in the way that their own institutions provide library and IT services e.g. implementing up-to-date technologies and workflows. This novel approach to learning and teaching is based on the concept of co-operation, collaboration and trust between all of the participating partners, its core philosophy is the full ownership by the less developed southern partner institutions. This paper and presentation describes in detail the work done in the CUHAS (the Catholic University of Health and Allied Sciences), Mwanza, Tanzania. The introduction of e-learning and its implementation in teaching and learning in the higher institutions and research centers will exert a major impact on knowledge management and dissemination and development of information systems. Currently, Public Health teachers and students at CUHAS are using the Moodle e-learning platform. The HEI-ICI project has also created new services as well as improving existing ones, particularly to adapt to the changing habits and reading styles of our patrons e.g. the adoption of e-resources; the introduction of the KOHA integrated library system, the exploitation of social media in learning and teaching. In addition, we will describe the whole project and its results in the other participating institutions.",2565867344; 2562021536; 2561218621,Oscar Joachim; Ismael Khangane; Jarmo Saarti

Such data is referred to as open scientific data. Four key drivers are identified: (i) Changing societal approaches and increasing expectations that the outcomes of publicly-funded research be freely available; (ii) the emergence of data journals; (iii) changing policies of research funders and publishers; and (iv) the requirements for research organisations and individual researchers to comply with these policies and introduce research data management plans. In this chapter, the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (CERN) is used as a case study to show how open scientific data can be successfully managed and used, in innovative ways, to deliver open education in particle physics. Finally, this chapter identifies three challenges that require attention of research funders and scientific organisations. First, the challenge to devise a minimum standard for open scientific data. Second, the challenge to develop incentives for researchers and librarians, and third, the challenge to reconceptualise the ownership of open scientific data. This chapter argues that addressing these challenges can advance the preservation and sharing of open scientific data for the global public good.",2556280505,Vera Lipton

Many of these clusters are consistently under utilized while researchers on campus could greatly benefit from these unused capabilities. By leveraging principles from the Open Science Grid it is now possible to utilize these resources by forming a lightweight campus grid. The campus grids framework enables jobs that are submitted to one cluster to overflow, when necessary, to other clusters within the campus using whatever authentication mechanisms are available on campus. This framework is currently being used on several campuses to run HEP and other science jobs. Further, the framework has in some cases been expanded beyond the campus boundary by bridging campus grids into a regional grid, and can even be used to integrate resources from a national cyberinfrastructure such as the Open Science Grid. This paper will highlight 18 months of operational experiences creating campus grids in the US, and the different campus configurations that have successfully utilized the campus grid infrastructure.",2144263850; 2591958925; 1989818769; 2594786813,Derek Weitzel; Dan Fraser; B.

It reflects the philosophy of PAGES and its community of scientists that the past holds the key to better projections of the future. Climatic and environmental evidence from the past can be used to sharpen future projections of global change, thereby informing political and societal decisions on mitigation and adaptation. Young scientists are critical to the future of this endeavour, which we call 'paleoscience'. Their scientific knowledge, interdisciplinarity, international collaboration, and leadership skills will be required if this field is to continue to thrive. Meanwhile, it is also important to remember that science develops not only by applying new strategies and new tools to make new observations, but also by building upon existing knowledge. Modern research in paleoscience began around fifty years ago, and one could say that the third generation of researchers is now emerging. It is a wise investment to ensure that existing skills and knowledge are transferred to this generation. This will enable them to lead the science towards new accomplishments, and to make important contributions towards the wider field of global change science. Motivated by such considerations, PAGES organized its first Young Scientists Meeting (YSM), held in Corvallis (Oregon, USA) in July 2009 (http://www.pages-osm.org/ysm/index.html). The meeting took place immediately before the much larger 3rd PAGES Open Science Meeting (OSM; http://www.pages-osm.org/osm/index.html). The YSM brought together 91 early-career scientists from 21 different nations. During the two-day meeting, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and new faculty met to present their work and build networks across geographical and disciplinary borders. Several experienced and well-recognized researchers tutored this conference, and gave assistance to young scientists by offering advice on publication, promotion, outreach processes, and data management. At the subsequent OSM, the young scientists had the opportunity to present their results to a larger community, and to build networks with their senior colleagues. In a friendly and classroom-like atmosphere, the research presented during the YSM was of a remarkably high quality, and merited publication in this special issue. The 23 short proceedings papers are first-authored by YSM attendees, and based on their presented work and the associated discussions. Consistent with the spirit of the YSM, the core of the guest editor team consisted of YSM early-career scientists, while members of the wider scientific community reviewed the papers. Studies presented in this issue cover a large range of topics. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental research is always seeking new natural archives and improved proxies, and so some papers focus on reconstruction methodologies and the interpretation and calibration of proxies. Other papers present a variety of modeling approaches, such as climate system modeling, forward modeling, or ecosystem modeling. Still others focus on reconstructions from marine (foraminifera, diatoms, corals) or continental (tree rings, speleothems, ice cores) archives, or on understanding the dynamics of the Earth system and the feedbacks between its various components. The studies presented span timescales ranging from the past 200,000 years to the last few decades, and consider changes in natural phenomena such as the hydrological cycle and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, as well as local- and regional-scale interaction of humans with the environment. The papers presented in this special issue therefore reflect current challenges in paleoscience research: understanding natural variability on both long and short time scales, and monitoring anthropogenic impacts which range from historic landscaping to more recent pollution. The concept and format of the 1st PAGES YSM worked very well, and created a high degree of enthusiasm and stimulation among the participants (as is demonstrated by this special issue). The 2nd YSM is therefore firmly planned to take place in 2013, back-to-back with the 4th PAGES OSM. Crucial and gratefully acknowledged contributions to the success of the YSM were made by the numerous co-sponsors (see logos below), who provided the financial basis for the YSM and supported the attendance of many early-career researchers from various parts of the world. Furthermore, we cordially thank all reviewers for shaping this proceeding issue with their insightful and helpful reviews.",2764969885; 2710211839; 2764349552; 2764705229; 2676567692; 2622467165,Caroline Cléroux; Jennifer Fehrenbacher; Steven Phipps; Summer Rupper; Branwen Williams; Thorsten Kiefer

One of the possible dangers of academic patenting is to divert researchers from long-term-oriented research and to delay the publication of results in open science. The question of unintended consequences of technology transfer and crowd-out effect is a critical issue when trying to foster technical change and ensure provision of top quality research in the long run. Nevertheless, little evidence has been provided until now to support either view. The aim of this paper is to search for evidence of rivalry between academic patenting and scientific research in a panel of 1323 researchers along 30 years. Drawing on bibliometrics, biographical and patent data of a sample of (tenured and untenured) publicly-funded researchers working in the fields of Engineering Chemistry and Nanotechnologies for New Materials, we implement two econometric models in order to understand if patenting and inventing is likely to affect the quantity and the quality of publications in a researcher’s career. Results show that the occurrence of a patent is positively associated with the quality of previous and the quantity of later scientific publications.",2014626674; 2662739833,Mario Calderini; Chiara Franzoni

In the Open Science Grid (OSG), privileges are granted on the basis of the user's membership to a Virtual Organization (VO). However, Grid sites are solely responsible to determine and control access privileges to resources using users’ identity and personal attributes, which are available through Grid credentials. While this guarantees full control on access rights to the sites, it makes VO privileges heterogeneous throughout the Grid and hardly fits with the Grid paradigm of uniform access to resources. To address these challenges, we are developing the Scalable Virtual Organization Privileges Management Environment (SVOPME), which provides tools for VOs to define, publish, and verify desired privileges and assists sites to provide the appropriate access policies. Moreover, SVOPME provides tools for grid site to analyze site access policies for various resources, verify compliance with preferred VO policies, and generate directives for site administrators on how the local access policies can be amended to achieve such compliance without taking control of local configurations away from site administrators. This paper discusses what access policies are of interest to the OSG community and how SVOPME implements privilege management tools for the OSG.",2091181715; 2674454772; 25894833; 2719624678; 2714839988,Tanya Levshina; Balamurali Ananthan; Gabriele Garzoglio; Nanbor Wang; I.

This has a direct impact on libraries, archives, and other service providers in the data curation and access landscape. DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT The GESIS Data Archive for the Social Sciences (DAS) has been curating and disseminating social science research data since 1960. The article presents tools, services, and strategies developed by the DAS to support the research community in adequately responding to the legal, ethical, and practical challenges that the transformation towards data-centric, open science presents. These include GESIS’s Secure Data Center, the data publication platform “datorium” and a recent project to create a georeferencing service for survey data. LESSONS LEARNED The experiences gained through these activities show that getting involved—now, rather than further down the road—pays off in that it allows service providers to actively shape the ongoing transformation. At the same time, by cooperating with suitable partners, the effort and investment of resources can be kept at a manageable level for individual organizations.",2119464303; 2407249995; 2337236126; 2608890317,Astrid Recker; Stefan Müller; Jessica Trixa; Natascha Schumann

This is not least because the creation of large collaborative scientific databases amplifies the complicated interactions between proprietary, for-profit R&D and public ""open science"". We draw on experiences from the field of bioinformatics to examine some of the likely consequences of these interactions in neuroscience. The widespread sharing of data and tools for neuroscientific research is a key step in the development of neuroinformatics. We consider some of the areas in which policy frameworks can facilitate these forms of collaboration, by easing legal and cultural barriers which have slowed developments to date.",2677527394; 2720812751,P.

The principal problems arise from the idiosyncracy of observations on the research frontier and the exceptional specificity of the human capital employed in identifying and validating scientific novelty. Resolution of these problems was by no means inevitable or predictable, as the scientific institutions which had emerged as the principal institutional support of ‘Open Science’ in the seventeenth and eighteenth century could not be efficiently scaled up to accommodate the requirements of a greatly expanded scientific enterprise. This paper recounts how in the second quarter of the nineteenth century the emergence of decentralized university-based research networks in Germany resolved the problem of scale, laying the foundations for the discoveries that powered the ‘Second Industrial Revolution’ of the late nineteenth and early twentieth century.",2687451305,George Grantham

In der funktional differenzierten Gesellschaft ist die Inklusionsordnung der Wissenschaft strikt an verberuflichte Leistungsrollen gebunden, wahrend alle ubrigen Gesellschaftsmitglieder weitgehend exkludiert werden. Unsere These ist, dass im Zuge des digitalen Wandels neue Inklusionsmuster entstehen. Wir beobachten die Verbreitung funktionalisierter Subrollen, in denen die professionelle Rolle des Wissenschaftlers dekomponiert wird. Eine gesellschaftstheoretisch informierte Beschreibung dieser neuen digitalen Inklusionsprofile leistet zweierlei: Zum einen wird dadurch ein differenzierungstheoretischer Konservatismus uberwunden, der Diagnosen einer Offnung der Wissenschaft lediglich als semantische Oberflachenphanomene deutet. Zum anderen lasst sich analytische Distanz zu dominanten Selbst- und Fremdbeschreibungen gewinnen, die diese Entwicklung als Demokratisierung der Wissenschaft rhetorisch uberhchen. Schlagworte: Wissenschaftssoziologie; Inklusion; Citizen Science; Web 2.0; gesellschaftliche Differenzierung. Summary: From the perspective of systems theory, science is a prototype of a self-referential functional system that maintains social distance to the public. In functionally differentiated societies, science maintains a strict regime of inclusion, which is closely tied to the professional role of the scientist as someone who produces and acquires knowledge. We suggest that the digital revolution is generating novel modes of inclusion. These take the form of functionalized subroles in which the professional role of the scientist is disassembled. By proposing a socio-theoretically informed characterization of these new modes of inclusion we aim to meet two different goals: The first is to overcome the theoretical conservatism of differentiation theory, in which diagnoses of the social openness of science are solely interpreted as semantic surface phenomena. The second is to achieve analytical distance to a societal discourse that describes these new modes of inclusion as examples of a successful democratization of science.",2622933841; 2707677959,Sascha Dickel; Martina Franzen

Aiming to link the multiple visions for the next phase of GIS development, this article suggests that the emerging open GIS should serve as a guiding concept. Contextualized in the broader literature of open science, this article proposes open GIS should include eight dimensions related to data, software, hardware, standards, research, publication, funding, and education. For the GIS community, open GIS offers four exciting opportunities: (1) technology-driven opportunities for addressing challenges posed by the (spatial) big data deluge; (2) application-led opportunities for confronting the problems of a rapidly changing planet; (3) curiosity-inspired, crowd-powered opportunities for the development of an open and geographic citizen science; and (4) education-focused opportunities for implementing the vision of a spatial university. Although there are academic, legal, social/political, and environmental impediments for the practice of open GIS, open GIS will become increasingly important in shaping our research and educational agendas in the future.",2712048811,Daniel Sui

Rapid advances in computing, communications, and observational technologies &#x2013; along with concomitant advances in high-resolution modeling, ensemble and coupled-systems predictions of the Earth system &#x2013; are revolutionizing nearly every aspect of the geosciences. Modern data volumes from high-resolution ensemble prediction systems and next-generation remote-sensing systems like hyper-spectral satellite sensors and phased-array radars are staggering. The advent and maturity of cloud computing technologies and tools have opened new avenues for addressing both big data and Open Science challenges to accelerate scientific discoveries. There is broad consensus that as data volumes grow rapidly, it is particularly important to reduce data movement and bring processing and computations to the data. Data providers also need to give scientists an ecosystem that includes data, tools, workflows and other end-to-end applications and services needed to perform analysis, integration, interpretation, and synthesis - all in the same environment or platform. Instead of moving data to processing systems near users, as is the tradition, one will need to bring processing, computing, analysis and visualization to data - so called data proximate workbench capabilities, also known as server-side processing.",2770947393,Mohan Ramamurthy

It aims to enable an open information ecosystem to understand systematically what data underpins literature and what literature references data. Scholix is an evolving lightweight set of guidelines to increase interoperability. It consists of: A consensus among a growing group of publishers, datacentres, and global/ domain service providers to work collaboratively and systematically to improve exchange of data-literature link information Information model: conceptual definition of what is a Scholix scholarly link Scholix is the “wholesaler to wholesaler” exchange framework, to be implemented by existing hubs or global aggregators of data-literature link information such as DataCite, CrossRef, OpenAIRE, or EMBL-EBI. These hubs in turn work with their natural communities of data centres or literature publishers to collect the information through existing community-specific workflows and standards. Scholix thus enables interoperability between a smaller number of large hubs and leverages the existing exchange arrangements between those hubs and their natural communities (eg between CrossRef and journal publishers). Scholix is a technical solution to wholesale information aggregation; it will need to be complemented by other policy, practice and cultural change advocacy initiatives. This approach could be extended over time to other types of research objects in and beyond research (e.g. software, tweets, etc).",2524264598; 2490268810; 2555831580; 2776371155,Adrian Burton; Martin Fenner; Wouter Haak; Paolo Manghi

When it is comprehensively approached within integrated modeling environments, research teams often must recreate modeling foundations on which to base their own research, often because they are unable to access similar foundations already established by others. Moreover, there is an increasing awareness that energy, water, and environmental issues are best studied at the regional level, and many of the most relevant human-environmental interactions are tied to production and consumption technologies that themselves are tightly bound to regional economic systems that comprise national economies. We need to integrate and model these interacting systems comprehensively, and in an open access environment that promotes interaction among scholars, and database and model sharing to eliminate wasteful and redundant foundation infrastructure building. The pace of new knowledge development can be advanced radically by adopting a common and well-tested integrated systems modeling approach for widespread scientific use and development, supporting a research community that spans a wide range of problem domains. The future of regional science research thus lies in the integrated and comprehensive modeling of interacting systems. This paper describes our vision of this open science future, which we believe will rest on an open source and object-oriented foundation. We describe OASIS, a specific exemplar project now underway designed to fill the current integrated systems science infrastructure void with a framework whose evolutionary character will ultimately reflect the conceptual strengths and contributions of a large community of scholars. The result will be distinguished not only by the collective wisdom of the modeling community, but also by careful attention to the mechanisms that support replication and reproducibility. With the advantage of 21st century technology, object oriented open source open science will deepen our understanding and radically accelerate the pace of knowledge building in coming decades. We see this as a fundamentally new knowledge building paradigm that will dominate future integrated systems research.",2238406718; 2293904581; 2720050848,Randall W. Jackson; Sergio J.

Much to the surprise of open access critics, PLoS Biology recently achieved a high impact factor of 13.9 after only two years of publishing, a feat rarely accomplished even in more traditional print journals.
	The Public Library of Science (PLoS) employed the most liberal interpretation of the Budapest–Bethesda–Berlin (BBB) open access (OA) principles when creating its inaugural journal, PLoS Biology, after extensive OA advocacy efforts. BBB principles encourage open access for all individuals with an Internet connection and free use of all information for any educational purposes, including the creation of derivative works.
	This study explores new OA research methodologies for measuring an OA technology’s effect on the Internet community. I will analyze linking patterns from a variety of Web categories to individual PLoS Biology articles from November 2004, a one–month, investigatory glimpse into who cites these articles and how this compares to Google Scholar citations of the same article.
	I will describe two principles involved in the scientific OA transaction: the “gifting” of scientific articles and the further proliferation of this scientific information being given back to the community in the form of citation. Drawing on Marcel Mauss, I will highlight how the concept of “gifting” deviates from “sharing” in an Internet environment. I will conclude by highlighting the public citation finding in order to investigate the “public” in the Public Library of Science.",2686052275,Charlotte A. Tschider

ER’s goal is to be the leading ecological, evolutionary, and biodiversity journal in Asia. This article introduces the development of ER, improvements to its editorial system and their outcomes, and the strategies designed to achieve this goal. ER has already become a leading comprehensive and international publication as shown by statistical evidence and its strong editorial foundation. However, some members of the Ecological Society of Japan (ESJ) retain impressions of an old stereotype about ER. The discrepancy between the current status of the journal and its stereotype may explain why submissions from Japan remain static. A new article category for ER, Biodiversity in Asia, was created to encourage Asian studies. In addition, the Forum category is dedicated to promoting a broad understanding of the ESJ’s various activities. To promote open science, the proportion of open access articles in the journal is increasing. The publication of Data papers has been accelerated to improve the public availability of excellent open data sets. ER symposia and seminars provide good opportunities for members to participate. ER financially supports the invitation of scientists internationally to facilitate research exchanges with other countries and consequently promotes the internationalization of the ESJ. The ESJ is open to the world’s ecologists, and your participation in developing ER is welcome.",2154853126; 2069299297; 2606466102; 2607305865; 1986590720,Tomonori Tsunoda; Buntarou Kusumoto; Kei ichi Okada; Yuko Aoshima; Atsushi Kume

In recent years, some medical sciences and behavioral sciences struggled with what came to be known as replication crises. As a field, criminology has yet to address formally the threats to our evidence base that might be posed by large-scale and systematic replication attempts, although it is likely we would face challenges similar to those experienced by other disciplines. In this review, we outline the basics of replication, summarize reproducibility problems found in other fields, undertake an original analysis of the amount and nature of replication studies appearing in criminology journals, and consider how criminology can begin to assess more formally the robustness of our knowledge through encouraging a culture of replication.

The research methods commonly used by psychologists, especially the statistical analyses used to analyze experimental data, are under scrutiny. The lack of reproducible research findings in psychology and the paucity of published studies attempting to replicate psychology studies have been widely reported (e.g., Pashler and Wagenmakers, 2012; Ioannidis et al., 2014; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Although it is encouraging that people are aware of problems evident in mainstream psychology research and taking actions to correct them (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015), one problem has received little or no attention: the reliance on between-subjects research designs. The reliance on group comparisons is arguably the most fundamental problem at hand because such designs are what often necessitate the kinds of statistical analyses that have led to psychology's professional crisis (Sidman, 1960; Michael, 1974; Parsonson and Baer, 1978). But there is an alternative.

Single-case designs involve the intensive study of individual subjects using repeated measures of performance, with each subject exposed to the independent variable(s) and each subject serving as their own control (Sidman, 1960; Barlow et al., 2008; Johnston and Pennypacker, 2009; Kazdin, 2010). Comparisons of performance under baseline and experimental conditions are made for each subject, with any experimental effects replicated with the individual subject across time or across multiple subjects in the same experiment. Single-case experiments yield data that can be interpreted using non-inferential statistics and visual analysis of graphed data, a strategy characteristic of other natural sciences (Best et al., 2001). Single-case experimental designs are advantageous because they more readily permit the intensive investigation of each subject and they achieve replication within an experiment rather than across experiments. Thus, data from just a few subjects tells a story.",2153369499,Matthew P. Normand

The biomedical research community relies on the reproducibility of published discoveries to create new lines of research and to translate research findings into therapeutic applications. Since 2012, when scientists from Amgen reported that they were able to reproduce only 6 of 53 'landmark' preclinical studies, the biomedical research community began discussing the scale of the reproducibility problem and developing initiatives to address critical challenges. GBSI released the 'Case for Standards' in 2013, one of the first comprehensive reports to address the rising concern of irreproducible biomedical research. Further attention was drawn to issues that limit scientific self-correction including reporting and publication bias, underpowered studies, lack of open access to methods and data, and lack of clearly defined standards and guidelines in areas such as reagent validation. To evaluate the progress made towards reproducibility since 2013, GBSI identified and examined initiatives designed to advance quality and reproducibility. Through this process, we identified key roles for funders, journals, researchers and other stakeholders and recommended actions for future progress.

Sadly, result reproducibility is often an overlooked feature accompanying original research publications, competitions and benchmark evaluations. The main reasons behind such a gap arise from natural complications in research and development in this area: the distribution of data may be a sensitive issue; software frameworks are difficult to install and maintain; Test protocols may involve a potentially large set of intricate steps which are difficult to handle. To bridge this gap, we built an open platform for research in computational sciences related to pattern recognition and machine learning, to help on the development, reproducibility and certification of results obtained in the field. By making use of such a system, academic, governmental or industrial organizations enable users to easily and socially develop processing toolchains, re-use data, algorithms, workflows and compare results from distinct algorithms and/or parameterizations with minimal effort. This article presents such a platform and discusses some of its key features, uses and limitations.

This paper argues that the emergence of the Free Software Movement is closely related to the ethos of science, that the Free Software Movement is the result of the efforts to retrieve the ethos of science in the area of computer software, and that the philosophy of free software is the fruit of adhering to and carrying forward the ethos of science. On the other hand, the Free Software Movement offers challenges to the enhanced protection of intellectual property and enhanced secrecy of scientific research data and provides great enlightenments for institutionalization of the ethos of modern science, thus triggering the so called ""Open Science"" movement.",2723806519,Li Lun

Dabei geht es um die Frage, wie wissenschaftlicher Erfolg - oder Scientific Impact - mit differenzierteren Massen als der Bibliometrie gemessen werden kann: In einem durch die Digitalisierung sich stetig verandernden Wissenschaftsbetrieb (Stichworte sind Open Access, Open Data und Networked Science) bieten sich dazu immer mehr Moglichkeiten und Daten. In Zusammenarbeit mit der wissenschaftlichen Social Network Site ResearchGate findet deshalb an der Universitat St. Gallen ein exploratives Pilotprojekt statt, das Scientific Impact in der BWL uber Netzwerkmetriken und die Aktivitat von Wissenschaftlern in der Online-Community messen mochte. Die Prasentation gibt einen Einblick in das entstehende Feld der Altmetrics und stellt das Pilotprojekt vor. Als ubergeordnetes Ziel soll die Diskussion angeregt werden, ob und wie Daten aus Online Social Networks wie Researc hGate oder Mendeley die traditionelle Bibliometrie erganzen oder gar ersetzen konnen.",2625966937,Christoph Lutz

These principles were founded upon the idea that Science is based on building on, reusing and openly criticising the published body of scientific knowledge’ (http://pantonprinciples.org) and they provide a succinct list of the fundamentals to observe when making your data open. Intended for a broad audience of academics, publishers and librarians, Issues in Research Data explores the implications of the Panton Principles through a number of perspectives on open research data in the sciences and beyond. The book features chapters by open data experts in a range of academic disciplines, covering practical information on licensing, ethics, and advice for data curators, alongside more theoretical issues surrounding the adoption of open data. As the book is open access, each chapter can stand alone from the main volume so that communities can host, distribute, build upon and remix the content that is relevant to them.

In the spirit of open science, the toolbox enables researchers worldwide to assess the quality of street networks such as OpenStreetMap (OSM) by calculating key performance indicators commonly used in street network comparison studies.

Issues such as the benefits (and pitfalls) of integrating theory and experiment, working with large datasets, and open science. We will be inviting opinion pieces from leaders in many different areas of theoretical and experimental neuroscience, but would like to expand beyond the 'usual suspects' to hear the thoughts of young scientists. We are particularly keen to receive opinion pieces from graduate students and postdocs. Perhaps a new hypothesis has arisen from attending a particularly interesting meeting, a paper that went relatively unnoticed when first published but has since been proven seminal, a study that has recently caught your attention, or maybe you have a prediction of where a particular field will be in 10 years? All of these, and more, will be considered.

Essays should be one or two pages long, and will be selected based on their content as well as style. This is a fantastic opportunity to have your voice heard in the community, and to participate in the wider debate on the future of your field.

Open science and the increasing data sharing requirements from governments, funding bodies, institutions and scientific journals has led to a pressing demand for the development of data metrics. As a very first step towards reliable data metrics, we need to better comprehend the limitations and caveats of the information provided by sources of open data. In this paper, we critically examine records downloaded from the DataCite’s OAI API and elaborate a series of recommendations regarding the use of this source for bibliometric analyses of open data. We highlight issues related to metadata incompleteness, lack of standardization, and ambiguous definitions of several fields. Despite these limitations, we emphasize DataCite’s value and potential to become one of the main sources for data metrics development.",2787088827; 1923114979; 2136102793; 2035848498,Nicolas Robinson-Garcia; Philippe Mongeon; Wei Jeng; Rodrigo Costas

In doing so, he identified three challenges facing EU member states in the years to come. First, he said that Europe is lagging behind in transferring the results of research into new products and services: too often, new technologies that are developed in Europe are commercialized elsewhere. Second, Europe needs to improve the quality of its research output: although the EU generates more scientific results and publications than any other region in the world, it does not capture a proportional share of high‐impact or highly cited landmark publications. Third, he noted that Europe punches below its weight in international science and science diplomacy: Europe's voice should be more actively raised in global debates. Recent discussions and moratoria about gain‐of‐function experiments in virology or about modifying the human germ line confirm the Commissioner's point: they are mostly initiated and driven by US researchers, and the USA is still the most influential country in terms of international science policy debates.

In order to meet these challenges, Commissioner Moedas proposed three strategic priorities: “Open Innovation,” “Open Science” and “Openness to the World” [1]. Open Innovation consists of policy measures intended to speed up the commercialization of research by introducing novel funding sources and modes of investment. Open Science, the Commissioner believes, is the key to increasing excellence, which he hopes will spread from the European Research Council and the Marie Sklodowska Curie Actions programme to the rest of Horizon 2020. Concrete policy measures in this regard are a call for a European Science Cloud Project and support for open access publishing to make the results of research immediately available without any constraints. Finally, Openness to the World …",2289751786,Helga Nowotny

1. the vast majority of ethical debate about biodefense research to date has focused on the dual use problem, and

2. the focus of ethical discussion of dual-use research has been on the need to strike ‘a proper balance of only two dominant values: biosecurity and “open science”’ —the idea being that ‘under current conditions other values can and ought to be ignored because the stakes are so high’.1

With regard to (2), Buchanan and Kelley's main point is that policy making regarding biodefense and dual use should be seen as an ‘optimisation problem’—the aim should be to achieve the greater good of society, where all relevant values are taken into account, rather than limiting attention to just two values—security and open science—in particular. While, as other commentators have argued, it is questionable whether these authors have provided an accurate account of ethical discussion of biodefense and dual use to date, in this brief commentary my purpose is to argue that the values of security and open science should themselves be seen as proxies for other values (comprising the greater good of society) and that solution to …",312765877,Michael J.

The Digital Cultural Heritage (DCH) sector also has the challenge of the complexity of the information itself. This is because of the relationship that each cultural object has with the collections it is part of, with the memory institutions where it is held, with the other objects of the same nature and/or culturally connected with it, and the many other types of relationships that represent the real scientific value of the digitised cultural object (be it a book, an archival record, an artefact from a museum, a sound recording or a video).

Since the first bacterial genome was published 20 years ago, there has been an explosion in the production of sequence data, fuelled by next-generation sequencing, placing biology at the forefront of data-driven science. As a consequence, there is now huge demand for the physical infrastructure to produce, analyse and share software and datasets. This need is compounded by the continuing lack of trained bioinformaticians to analyse the data. In 2014 the Medical Research Council made a ~£50m investment in “big data” to support the development of new research infrastructures. The £8.5m CLoud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) was the only award to a microbial consortium and is one the largest investments in microbial genomics bioinformatics ever made. CLIMB will provide bioinformatics infrastructure as a service to the academic UK medical microbial community. CLIMB is spread across four sites (Birmingham, Cardiff, Swansea and Warwick) and we provide a single sign-on, distributed computing and storage infrastructure. The total investment in hardware is £3.6m, which provides 7680 virtual CPUs, 500 terabytes of local high performance storage per site and 7000 terabytes (7PB) of replicated object storage. This facility is sufficient to provide over a thousand simultaneously running virtual machines to users. The service is implemented using the open-source OpenStack framework. Users will be able to login using their eduroam account and start up virtual machines instantly with access to large microbial genome datasets. We will present case studies of using CLIMB to integrate large microbial datasets from diverse sources and provide live demos of the service. CLIMB is currently in a beta testing state and we are looking for early access participants to help us develop the service. In parallel with the development of the system itself we are running an active programme of bioinformatics training workshops hosted in newly commissioned space at Warwick, Swansea and Birmingham",2307977539; 2781209787; 2499513515; 2735612246; 2784817347; 1344789241,Thomas Richard Connor; Nick Loman; Simon Thompson; Matt Ismail; Sam Sheppard; Mark J.

However in the last two decades this traditiona has been eroded by intellectual property claims. Such claims encompass fundamental discoveries from which knowledge for future products is drawn. Although patents have been regarded as means to promote the progress of science, recent examples in biomedicine show that this is not always the case. Reiterated granting of patents not only on commercial end products but even on so called research tools may hinder further research, either by creating too many concurrent fragments of intellectual property rights or by increasing the transaction costs of bundling up such rights. These effects are sometimes strengthened by a deliberate policy of allowing applications for patents on the results of publicly funded research. The shortcomings of intellectual property rights can be better understood and dealt with according to the theory of the public domain, which offers a strong case for a new approach to the governance of science and knowledge.",2720871590,Emanuela Gambini

To support this perspective, I present evidence from case studies, published literature, and personal experiences as a practicing open scholar. I describe some of the challenges inherent to practicing open scholarship, and some of the tensions created by incompatibilities between institutional policies and personal practice. To address this, I propose several concrete actions universities could take to support open scholarship, and outline ways in which such initiatives could benefit the public as well as institutions. Importantly, I do not think most of these actions would require new funding, but rather a redistribution of existing funds and a rewriting of internal policies to better align with university’s stated missions of dissemination of knowledge and societal impact.",2632207355,Erin C.

Scientific computing has influenced how science is done today, achieving breakthroughs that were impossible to achieve several decades ago. For the past decade several such communities in the Open Science Grid (OSG) and the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) have been using GlideinWMS to run complex application workflows to effectively share computational resources over the grid. GlideinWMS is a pilot-based workload management system (WMS) that creates on demand, a dynamically sized overlay HTCondor batch system on grid resources. At present, the computational resources shared over the grid are just adequate to sustain the computing needs. We envision that the complexity of the science driven by 'Big Data' will further push the need for computational resources. To fulfill their increasing demands and/or to run specialized workflows, some of the big communities like CMS are investigating the use of cloud computing as Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IAAS) with GlideinWMS as a potential alternative to fill the void. Similarly, communities with no previous access to computing resources can use GlideinWMS to setup up a batch system on the cloud infrastructure. To enable this, the architecture of GlideinWMS has been extended tomore » enable support for interfacing GlideinWMS with different Scientific and commercial cloud providers like HLT, FutureGrid, FermiCloud and Amazon EC2. In this paper, we describe a solution for cloud bursting with GlideinWMS. The paper describes the approach, architectural changes and lessons learned while enabling support for cloud infrastructures in GlideinWMS.« less",2034179383; 1608830970; 2764377675; 2723954014; 2714839988; 2776923209,Parag Mhashilkar; Anthony Tiradani; B.

In this paper a solution for this issue is proposed by means of the gold- oriented method which assumes placing scientific papers of traditional academic journals in open access and ensuring their visibility on the Internet. This method is implemented in the project of open science repository called as CyberLeninka and discussed in details in the paper. Also plans to evolve CyberLeninka to a CERIF-CRIS and vision to build the e-infrastructure of Open Science in Russia are provided.",2482368347; 2494408762; 2665355128,Dmitry Semyachkin; Eugene Kislyak; Mikhail Sergeev

We present the generic components of such workflows to provide a reference model for these stakeholders. The RDA-WDS Data Publishing Workflows group set out to study the current data-publishing workflow landscape across disciplines and institutions. A diverse set of workflows were examined to identify common components and standard practices, including basic self-publishing services, institutional data repositories, long-term projects, curated data repositories, and joint data journal and repository arrangements. The results of this examination have been used to derive a data-publishing reference model comprising generic components. From an assessment of the current data-publishing landscape, we highlight important gaps and challenges to consider, especially when dealing with more complex workflows and their integration into wider community frameworks. It is clear that the data-publishing landscape is varied and dynamic and that there are important gaps and challenges. The different components of a data-publishing system need to work, to the greatest extent possible, in a seamless and integrated way to support the evolution of commonly understood and utilized standards and--eventually--to increased reproducibility. We therefore advocate the implementation of existing standards for repositories and all parts of the data-publishing process, and the development of new standards where necessary. Effective and trustworthy data publishing should be embedded in documented workflows.

The transformations stemming from the use of digital technology have had a
fundamental impact on the sector of scientific communications [DIL 12]. In the first section, we will give an overview of the state of the art, showing that these new forms of scientific communication are often initially limited to a simple transposition of the paper version. However, new models of
transmission have also emerged, notably in terms of open access (free access with the possibility of reusing and redistributing the article(s) in question) and open science, which advocates an open scientific approach with the use of innovative peer review models (open peer review and mega-reviews). Based on these observations and ascertainments, we will go into greater depth in the concept of “hypermediating journals”, presented with regard to the development of the COSSI (Communication, organisation, societe du savoir et information: Community, Organization, Society of Knowledge and Information) journal. Inspired by the idea of a “mediating site” [DAV 04], a hypermediating journal proposes a redocumentarization of its corpus [PED 06, SAL 07] to reveal a new meaning.",2336309624; 2633812864,Lise Verlaet; Hans Dillaerts

The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of ~28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.",726432469,Bastian Greshake

The broad political agreement at the Amsterdam Conference last year to aim for full OA by 2020 at an EU level has added extra leverage to the attempt to progress with large-scale OA implementation across a fairly fragmented policy landscape. Even with the intrinsic contradiction between quickly reaching 100% OA and disrupting the present scholarly communications landscape, there’s a growing consensus that we’re heading towards a ‘new’ situation where Academia may regain some control over its own research output. The presentation looks into the current status of this process, examining the impact of disruptive initiatives like the Open Library of Humanities, the no-hybrid OA policies or Sci-Hub.",2728641477,Pablo de Castro

As adoption of open access languishes, increased openness among informal modes of scholarly communication is challenging normative conceptions of open science. Presently, numerous initiatives explore open practices; demonstrating new possibilities related to increased transparency and improved content interoperability. Such projects include, for example, the use of draft manuscript repositories, linked-data repositories, open lab notebooks, academic blogs, and formalized content ontologies. Although novel forms of scholarly communication on the Web are increasing, researchers are much less likely to depart from publishing in traditional journals, particularly when academic rewards are at stake. While there remains widespread adherence to traditional publishing models that fail to attain a normative degree of openness, the very notion of open science is evolving in less formal, technologically enabled, communication environments. This juxtaposition raises some interesting questions about the role of informal scholarly communication as a vehicle for the proliferation of openness. To address this, I examine development of digital scholarship platforms funded by an initiative promoting enhanced publications. Intended to accelerate transition of traditional publications to the Web medium, enhanced publications present already published texts in a Web environment with interlinking of content objects such as: data on which the publication is based, contextual scaffolding, post-publication reactions, and secondary analyses. The empirical purview of this study includes institutions, technologies, and communities of practice, in addition to the development team, as factors characterizing manifestations of openness.In this study ethnographic techniques and participant observation are used in a case study methodology. Physical presence is augmented by the Web medium itself, such that participant contributions are rendered visible through interlinking of digital objects and in the documentary traces of interaction. Openness, the object of study, is analytically framed in a context of social and technological interactions at both the interface and infrastructure scholarly communication. By framing openness as contingent upon interface and infrastructure, I foreground the dual role of technology in facilitating both agency and structure. Analysis of the Enhanced Publications initiative, and the projects produced by it, reveal new articulations of openness in scholarly communication that (a) leverage increased transparency and content interoperability (b) are situated in localized communities of practice, and (c) are inscribed in emergent communication practices and formats. These findings help to characterize new forms of open science that call into question the limited scope of ‘open access’ and the present focus on top-down mandates to put it into practice.",2602625474,Clifford Tatum

Through these war years, his extracurricular activities included firewatching at St Paul’s Cathedral. After the war he did his deferred national service in the Royal Air Force on a short service commission with tours to Egypt, and it was here that his passion for industrial medicine was born.

Painstakingly cataloguing the basic constituents of our DNA (‘genome sequencing’) took ten years, over three billion dollars and was a multinational collaboration. Since then, our ability to sequence genomes has been finessed so much that by 2017 it is possible to explore the 20,000 or so human genes for under £1000, in a matter of days. Such testing offers clues to our past, present and future health, as well as information about how we respond to medications so that truly ‘personalised medicine’ is now a reality.  

The impact of such a ‘genomic era’ is likely to have some level of impact on all of us, even if we are not directly using healthcare services ourselves. We explore how advancements in genetics are likely to be experienced by people, as patients, consumers and citizens; and urge policy makers to take stock of the pervasive nature of the technology as well as the human response to it.",2770166109; 2770189705,Jonathan Roberts; Anna Middleton

The research conducted at their leadership class facility touched our lives in both minute and massive ways - whether it was studying the catalytic properties of gold nanoparticles, predicting protein structures, or unearthing the secrets of exploding stars. The authors remained true to their vision to act as the forefront computational center in extending science frontiers by solving pressing problems for our nation. Our success in this endeavor was due mainly to the Department of Energy's (DOE) INCITE (Innovative and Novel Computational Impact on Theory and Experiment) program. The program awards significant amounts of computing time to computationally intensive, unclassified research projects that can make high-impact scientific advances. This year, DOE allocated 400 million hours of time to 28 research projects at the ALCF. Scientists from around the world conducted the research, representing such esteemed institutions as the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and European Center for Research and Advanced Training in Scientific Computation. Argonne also provided Director's Discretionary allocations for research challenges, addressing such issues as reducing aerodynamic noise, critical for next-generation 'green' energy systems. Intrepid - themore » ALCF's 557-teraflops IBM Blue/Gene P supercomputer - enabled astounding scientific solutions and discoveries. Intrepid went into full production five months ahead of schedule. As a result, the ALCF nearly doubled the days of production computing available to the DOE Office of Science, INCITE awardees, and Argonne projects. One of the fastest supercomputers in the world for open science, the energy-efficient system uses about one-third as much electricity as a machine of comparable size built with more conventional parts. In October 2009, President Barack Obama recognized the excellence of the entire Blue Gene series by awarding it to the National Medal of Technology and Innovation. Other noteworthy achievements included the ALCF's collaboration with the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) to examine cloud computing as a potential new computing paradigm for scientists. Named Magellan, the DOE-funded initiative will explore which science application programming models work well within the cloud, as well as evaluate the challenges that come with this new paradigm. The ALCF obtained approval for its next-generation machine, a 10-petaflops system to be delivered in 2012. This system will allow us to resolve ever more pressing problems, even more expeditiously through breakthrough science in the years to come.« less",2636552427,C. Drugan

JeDEM, the Journal of E-democracy and Open Government (jedem.org), was first published in 2009 as an initiative of the Centre for E-Governance. It is an open access e-journal (that follows the green open access road) with a focus on topics such as e-democracy, e-participation, open government and open access. The journal follows the green open access road, and it is indexed with EBSCO [1] , DOAJ [2] , Google Scholar and the Public Knowledge Project metadata harvester [3] . With a wide range of subjects and research fields, articles cover diverse topics so publishing in JeDEM attracts a wide range of authors and readers from different disciplines. While the effects and impact of open access publishing have been studied, there is less research on the motivational factors of publishing in open access e-journals (such as JeDEM) that focus on a user perspective (see e.g. Nicholas et al 2015; Jamali, Nicholas, and Herman 2016). A review of JeDEM by Quality Open Access Market (QOAM) [4] in 2016 provides an external evaluation of JeDEM, but in this contribution, we wish to present and to discuss a research design to assess the users’ perspectives and motivational factors for publishing open access whilst also considering different user types and disciplines. A workshop held at CEDEM16 (Conference for E-Democracy and Open Government 2016 [5] , see Lampoltshammer, Edelmann, und Schossboeck, 2016)), shed some light on the most important topics for researchers in open access publishing. The results of this workshop revealed some motivations for publishing open access. Another workshop will be held at CeDEM Asia 2016 (Conference for E-Democracy and Open Government Asia 2016) [6] , with the aim of uncovering further motivational factors and understanding them from a comparative perspective. Comparing the results of both workshops and a literature review regarding motivational factors for open access publishing will form the basis for developing and choosing the questions for a quantitative study (online survey) to be sent out to all users of JeDEM by summer 2017. Conferences in the area of open access will be used to discuss the methodology and set-up of this questionnaire. Registered and potential users will be encouraged to answer the survey, also to find out about their use of the features of the journal (e.g. commenting articles) and how such features contribute to the concept of open science and scholarly communication. By assessing the user perspective of our open access journal, we seek to answer questions such as: Can we distinguish differences in motivation for publishing in open access across user types and disciplines? What differences can be determined? How can users be classified according to their motivations and does it make sense to consider user types and motivations for management activities of an open access journal? What type of users are JeDEM users? What are users’ opinion on different aspects of open access publishing and its further development, e.g. open peer review etc. and how do user opinions differ across the disciplines or countries? How can results help other e-publishers or editors in the area of open access and contribute to the field of scholarly communication? As an ongoing research project, we will be looking forward for feedback and recommendations about how to develop the user survey and our activities for the journal.

The European Commission (EC) is also supporting the development of FOSS [...]. In addition to the financial savings, FOSS contributes to scientific knowledge freedom in computational science (CS) and is increasingly rewarded in the science-policy interface within the emerging paradigm of open science. Since complex computational science applications may be affected by software uncertainty, FOSS may help to mitigate part of the impact of software errors by CS community- driven open review, correction and evolution of scientific code. The continental scale of EC science-based policy support implies wide networks of scientific collaboration. Thematic information systems also may benefit from this approach within reproducible integrated modelling. This is supported by the EC strategy on FOSS: ""for the development of new information systems, where deployment is foreseen by parties outside of the EC infrastructure, [F]OSS will be the preferred choice and in any case used whenever possible"". The aim of this contribution is to highlight how a continental scale information system may exploit and integrate FOSS technologies within the transdisciplinary research underpinning such a complex system.

It presents OA policies and selected cases illustrating how these policies are implemented. Methods - Analysis of scientific articles, conference proceedings, and primary sources like documentations of OA projects and initiatives and correspondence with selected German institutions supporting Open Access. Conclusions - In Germany almost all most important scientific institutions support the development of both Open Access models, both the green way and the golden way. All German OA mandates are soft mandates which request rather than require self-archiving. They are implemented by the development of repository infrastructure and by financial support for publications. German OA advocates believe that the development of green way OA can be accelerated by changes in copyright law.",2513827664,Teresa Święćkowska

European partners involved are: Universita degli Studi Guglielmo Marconi (coordinator, Italy), Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (Spain), University of Lisbon (Portugal), University of Oxford (UK). The OportUnidad project explores the adoption of strategies and channels that embrace the principles of openness and reusability within the context of educational institutions.

 The State of OA: A large-scale analysis of the prevalence and impact of Open Access articles. 

Despite growing interest in Open Access (OA) to scholarly literature, there is an unmet need for large-scale, up-to-date, and reproducible studies assessing the prevalence and characteristics of OA. We address this need using oaDOI, an open online service that determines OA status for 67 million articles. We use three samples, each of 100,000 articles, to investigate OA in three populations: 1) all journal articles assigned a Crossref DOI, 2) recent journal articles indexed in Web of Science, and 3) articles viewed by users of Unpaywall, an open-source browser extension that lets users find OA articles using oaDOI. We estimate that at least 28% of the scholarly literature is OA (19M in total) and that this proportion is growing, driven particularly by growth in Gold and Hybrid. The most recent year analyzed (2015) also has the highest percentage of OA (45%). Because of this growth, and the fact that readers disproportionately access newer articles, we find that Unpaywall users encounter OA quite frequently: 47% of articles they view are OA. Notably, the most common mechanism for OA is not Gold, Green, or Hybrid OA, but rather an under-discussed category we dub Bronze: articles made free-to-read on the publisher website, without an explicit Open license.  We also examine the citation impact of OA articles, corroborating the so-called open-access citation advantage: accounting for age and discipline, OA articles receive 18% more citations than average, an effect driven primarily by Green and Hybrid OA. We encourage further research using the free oaDOI service, as a way to inform OA policy and practice.",1969205032; 2208157607; 291762745; 2081538865; 2740267712; 2741312048; 2741153153; 2787483045; 2735675035,Heather A.

In this article I wonder which scientists’ cultural elements sustain new open science practices. Against the celebrations of the revival of a 20th century Mertonian ethos of disinterest, I suggest that an ethos of openness can include justifications related to sharing as well as features such as anti-bureaucracy rebellion, hedonism and search for profit. It is a recombination of the modern scientist’s ethos with cultural systems related to hacking and information technologies. To show this emergence and thus the importance of hacker cultures for contemporary societies, I studied the public images related to the establishing of two open access genetic databases, and in particular the two biologists who lead those projects: Ilaria Capua and Craig Venter. This recombination maintains an ambivalence: while both cases are geared against today’s incumbents’ concentration of power, the justificatory system they have in common does not exclude entrepreneurship and profit.

They support top-level research and can be organized at the national and regional level, at EU Member State, European and global level. RIs have become a topic of interest and priority for funders, political bodies, and (increasingly) institutional decision makers. In Europe the European Commission is a funder of RIs, complementing funding done by EU Member States at the national level. Over the last ten years hundreds of RI-projects have been planned and some received funding for design, extension and improvement of operations and services to scientific communities. The ESFRI4 roadmap for research infrastructures represents a financial volume of approx. 20 billion EUR for ten years to construct 44 RIs. From the perspective of realizing the objectives set for RI, 2012 is an essential milestone, as the discussion of the HORIZON 2020 programmes at the European level will take place as well as consultations with member states. The following overview is by no means complete. It focuses on some RIs majorly influenced by the production and management of scientific information and which have relevance for the European political and funding agenda. RI projects include a variety of typologies, ranging from hard, single-site facilities to distributed, soft facilities relying on networks. Typically they have emerged from discipline-specific or cross-disciplinary requirements. RIs produce, process or manage big and small but heterogeneous volumes of information. They are the so-called ‘scientific data factories’ of the 21st century. They comprise various types of information resources such as publications, digitized collections, learning objects and research data. Key issues on today’s agenda for RIs are their uptake by researchers, and their viability, sustainability and interoperability. Research libraries’ engagement with RIs has been low. While this could be understandable in 2005 when the first priorities for RI investments were defined, it now represents a big gap in the European strategy. Key initiatives such as the ESFRI Research Infrastructures involve no participation by research libraries, except for DARIAH. Participation in EC-funded projects (through LIBER or directly through institutions) focused (with a few exceptions) on the areas of digitization, cultural heritage and publications. Research libraries need to become visible actors in strategic discussions on RIs and should actively explore their engagement in research data infrastructures. Open Access, open science (data), research data infrastructures and management are the catalysts to get research libraries back into the awareness of researchers beyond the humanities and social sciences. ‘Open Access is global — but implementation is local’. This is a popular slogan of the OpenAIRE project and gives local research libraries an important role in the European context. Research data are discipline-specific, but policies, workflows and standards also need to be implemented at the local level. Creating participatory infrastructures by involving institutional, national and disciplinary actors has been identified by the EC as a key task for the current decade. The term ‘participatory’ is also considered to be of fundamental relevance for European policy strategy, as it matches well with national and European coordination for cost efficiency and is instrumental in avoiding duplication of work. The primary challenges to building a coherent, fundable and sustainable ecosystem do not lie in ICT technology, but rather in governance, law, organization, socio- cultural aspects, trust, and, of course, costs.",2669638427,Norbert Lossau

In 2015 more than 700 customers qualified for this project and over 10,000 voucher codes were issued. We will provide background information and figures about the usage of the vouchers and acceptance of the project. We will review if there is a traceable record of success,  what effect the Gold for Gold project has on the RSC publications, if there is any measurable global impact; and finally what changes to expect in the future.

Which one of the two expressions better identifies the possible modes of interactions between Universities, market and firms? The paper addresses this question in the light of the advancements in the economic literature on the topic. It emerges that channels of interaction go far behind the technology transfer, including traditional output of university - scientific publications and graduates - and a variety of channels ranging from research in cooperation to consultancy. Moreover, it emerges that different channels are often complementary: a fact that has important implications for innovation policies and university long term strategies. The problem of the possible negative feed back of cooperation with private entities on production of open science by academics and on the traditional role of universities is the main concern of a growing stream of literature. Until now the results point, in a large majority, to a complementarity between academic research and market activities. Nonetheless, given the heterogeneity of academic production, and the possible different kinds of production functions, the conclusion can not be easily generalized.",2704486398,Saveria Capellari

In our opinion, the transformations related to the emergence of digital media needs to be put in a historical perspective. Open science is not necessary, but rather one among many possible evolutions that depend on several factors that include but go beyond technological evolution and adoption, and even cultural change. Here we sketch out three issues that we believe should be acknowledged as core problems by any research agenda that analyzes open science and the impact of digital technologies on the production and circulation of scientific knowledge: the resilience of communication formats over time, in this case the scientific paper; the increased importance for science to maintain its social boundaries; and finally the broader social positioning of scientific research and its communication practices.",620826715; 1224873507,Alessandro Delfanti; Nico Pitrelli

Amongst these models, one of the most interesting licenses is that offered by so-called copyleft licenses, which are licenses that allow software to be transferred with the insurance that the source code will remain open, with the caveat that anyone who redistributes the software, with or without changes, must pass along the freedom to further copy and change it. However, software development is not the only area in which this licensing model could apply. The viral nature of copyleft licenses has generated a considerable amount of interest in circles that transcend software development. The idea of sharing materials is not new, and has been made more evident by the chaotic and sometimes anarchic nature of the internet. However, shared materials tend to suffer from the possibility of third parties that use the freely acquired information to turn them into proprietary works. That is why many different organisations are turning to the copyleft model to protect works that are being freely shared online. One such project is the OpenContent License (OPL), a collaborative effort that sets a similar license to the GPL, ensuring that shared works will continue to remain free to subsequent users. A more ambitious project is the Creative Commons, which offers a wide range of licenses applicable to all sorts of creative material. In the area of biotechnology, there have been some suggestions that the copyleft model could be used to protect the public results of the human genome race being placed in the public domain by several researchers, something that has been suggested by a leading member of the Human Genome Consortium, although the idea has never been implemented. This paper will explore the application of copyleft licenses to other areas of research and development, and will try to explore if these can be successfully adapted to various different areas where creators want to share their works to the public but want to make sure that there will not be any further commercialisation of their creations.",664130172,Andres Guadamuz

Given the pace at which heterogeneous data are published on the web, thanks to initiatives such as Linked Data and Open Science, scalability of data exchange becomes crucial. Pivotal to data exchange is the chase algorithm, which is a fixpoint algorithm to evaluate both source-to-target constraints and target constraints in the data exchange process. In this paper, we investigate how new programming models such as MapReduce can be used to implement the chase on large-scale data sources. To the best of our knowledge, how to exchange data at scale has not been investigated so far. We present an initial solution for chasing source-to-target tuple generating dependencies and target tuple-generating dependencies, and discuss open issues that need to be addressed to leverage MapReduce for the data exchange problem.",542769824; 140057078,Khalid Belhajjame; Angela Bonifati

To Open Access and Open Data advocates, the web offers great opportunity for expanding the accessibility, scale, diversity and quality of archaeological communications. Nevertheless, Open Access and Open Data face steep adoption barriers. Critics wrongly see Open Access as a threat to peer review. Others see data transparency as naively technocratic and lacking in an appreciation of archaeology's social and professional incentive structure. However, as argued in this paper, the Open Access and Open Data movements do not gloss over sustainability, quality and professional incentive concerns. Rather, these reform movements offer much needed and trenchant critiques of the academy's many dysfunctions. These dysfunctions, ranging from the expectations of tenure and review committees to the structure of the academic publishing industry, go la...",2673964841,Eric C. Kansa

As any other basic science, the CS is publicly perceived as an open and free science that is trying to make progress in any possible direction, resolving scientific problems in its arena and dealing with pure scientific and issues and theoretical questions per se. In this paper I claim that this is not the case. CS is heavily controlled by commercial forces, which dictate its progress, goals and future directions. The new developments in the CS arena are in most cases the result of the market needs. Several research projects at the universities are funded by the industry, dealing with issues with a clear industrial aspect. Public funds, such as the 6 th European Framework project allocates a major portion of their funds for industrial research. The IEEE and ACM, the most respectful technology organizations of the CS, are governed by the industry and the universities at about equal share. The industry is holding patent rights for several CS research results, and CS scientists are issuing patents for their research because it may have a significant economic value. The CS is not an open science, in terms of Popper definition.",2669207754,Shai Ophir

One of the crucial components of a cyber-infrastructure is an accounting service that collects data related to resource utilization and identity of users using resources. The accounting service is important for verifying pledged resource allocation per particular groups and users, providing reports for funding agencies and resource providers, and understanding hardware provisioning requirements. It can also be used for end-to-end troubleshooting as well as billing purposes. In this work we describe Gratia, a federated accounting service jointly developed at Fermilab and Holland Computing Center at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. The Open Science Grid, Fermilab, HCC, and several other institutions have used Gratia in production for several years. The current development activities include expanding Virtual Machines provisioning information, XSEDE allocation usage accounting, and Campus Grids resource utilization. We also identify the direction of future work: improvement and expansion of Cloud accounting, persistent and elastic storage space allocation, and the incorporation of WAN and LAN network metrics.",2091181715; 2125772623; 1989818769; 2764771558; 2697526550,Tanya Levshina; Chander Sehgal; B.

GlaxoSmithKline recently placed the structures and activities of 177 novel anti-tubercular leads in the public domain, as well as the results of ongoing optimisation of some of the series. Since many of the compounds arose from screening campaigns, their provenance was unclear and synthetic routes were in many cases not reported. Here we present the efficient synthesis of several novel analogues of one family of the GSK compounds—termed “Spiros”—using an oxa-Pictet–Spengler reaction.

DOAJ has a special place in our hearts here in Lund as it was conceived  at the first  Nordic Conference on Scholarly Communication in Lund/Copenhagen 2002,  and then produced by the Lund University Libraries Head Office for ten years under  Lars Bjornshauge’s  leadership,  until he moved on to Director of SPARC Europe and Managing Director of DOAJ in its new constellation. From the DOAJ news release: “We have just completed the transition to a new environment and launched a new platform with integrated functionality for sharing, exporting and enhanced search/browse functionality: at the article level, search results can be filtered by language and publication year and by license and publication fee; at the journal level, you can filter by subject, by country, by license and by publication fees."" For the first time more than 50% of the journals are providing metadata at article level. DOAJ will continue to work with the 2000+ publishers to increase this figure. More than 1 million articles are now searchable in DOAJ which means more than 1 million article-level metadata entries are available for harvesting!! COMING EVENTS “Making Data Count: Research Data Availability and Research Assessment.” A Knowledge Exchange Workshop 11-12 April 2013 in Berlin Germany. Book the date for Motesplats Open Access (Meeting Place Open Access) 17-18  April 2013 at the School of Business, Gothenburg University. The 17th International Conference on Electronic Publishing -  “ Mining the Digital Information Networks ” will be held June 13-14, 2013 at  Blekinge Institute of Technology, Karlskrona, Sweden. ARTICLES Jan Erik Frantsvag analyses the consequences of the increasing tendency of large research funders to use their financial power to put pressure  behind their demands for Open Access.  Non-compliance with the contracts between funders and grantees will expose institutions and researchers to the risks of both economic and  career losses.In “Researcher, beware“ those risks are discussed. It is very important for institutions and researchers to be aware of possible consequences of funding contracts. Institutions with externally funded research are accused of gross negligence if they  do not teach  their researchers how to handle these contracts and what compliance implies. To avoid  the  risks and frustration involved in being exposed to a jungle of different policies, Frantsvag suggests, that everyone should align their policies with those of the EU or NIH.  Frantsvag also comments on the use of the CC-By licence, for instance required by the Wellcome Trust and the RCIK. http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/sciecominfo/article/view/6122/5251 --- In Iceland two important changes regarding open access took place in January 2013 . Solveig Thorsteinsdottir describes them in “Icelandic funder mandate and revised law for publicly supported research in Iceland“.  In December 2012 the Icelandic parliament approved a bill amending the law on public support for scientific research. A new article about open access was added, stating that: “The results of research funded by grants from the funds that come under this Act shall be published in open access and made accessible to everyone, unless otherwise agreed. Beneficiaries shall in all their research papers resulting from the funds,  state the name of the grantor.“ This important change was accompanied by another significan event: an open access mandate from the largest public funding agency, Rannis - the Icelandic Centre for Research http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/sciecominfo/article/view/6123/5250 --- Leif Longva : “Tendering the purchase of Open Access publishing” finds that open access publishing is about to enter a new phase. The benefits of OA are now widely acknowledged and receive high-level support. Longva chooses the Research Councils UK (RCUK), and the coming EU framework program Horizon 2020 as prominent examples when he takes  a market-oriented view of the fact that many institutions now establish funds to help authors pay their article processing  fees (APCs).  He quotes the RCIK policy: “RCUK does not specify an upper or lower limit on the level of APCs paid out of the Block Grant./---/At the same time, institutions should work with their authors to ensure that a proper market in APCs develops, with price becoming one of the factors that is taken into consideration when deciding where to publish.” The disadvantage of this system it that it lacks real incentives for authors to shop around for journals with the most reasonable APCs. Consequently, journals are free to set any prices they want. To deal with this situation and create a real market, tendering should be used to purchase open access to ensure that buyers/authors get the most value for money. http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/sciecominfo/article/view/6124/5252 --- Three authors from Lithuania, Gintare Tautkeviciene, Vilma Petrikaite, and Marija Eidukeviciute present the project “Open Access from the Perspectives of Young Researchers”.This project was implemented in 2012 by Kaunas University of Technology together with the Lithuanian Society of Young Researchers and the partners Lithuanian Research Libraries Consortium and the Association of Lithuanian Serials . While implementing this project three seminars on open access were organized. During these seminars the doctoral students, young scientists and other researchers were introduced to international and regional open access initiatives, the possibilities to become more globally visible, the European Commission, the European Research Council and other funding bodies' requirements for research publications and scientific data access, copyright issues,  and the concept of open science. A series of workshops was arranged,  concluding with a public discussion open access developments in Lithuania. http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/sciecominfo/article/view/6130/5257 --- In the Swedish report “It takes two to tango – making way for relevant research support services at Lund University Libraries (LUB)” Hanna Voog & Gunilla Wiklund present a 2012 project to investigate what types of support researchers in Lund need and in what areas. Were existing library services adequate, should they be strengthened or should entirely new services be developed?   The project included a literature review on definitions, examples of research support services  and researcher needs, as well as experiences of such support services. A survey was carried out  to identify existing support services at LUB , and  there were focus group interviews with researcher groups from each participating faculty. One result of  the project led to the important conclusion, that research support services need to be easily accessible, visible, and close to the researchers. http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/sciecominfo/article/view/6125/5253 --- Finally wee turn to the specific subject of open access monographies, discussed by Jorgen Eriksson and Aina Svensson in ”Monographs and Open Access”.The developments of OA publishing during the last decades has mainly focused on scientific and scholarly journal articles. However, an increasing number of initiatives concentrating on the academic monography have been introduced. There is now  a tendency  to regard business models for printed monograhies within Arts & Humanities and the Social Sciences as  unsustainable. Publishers, universities and other stakeholders are looking for new ways to handle monographies. Eriksson & Svensson present a Swedish project mainly focusing on two areas: to make monographies freely available, and to propose a national model for academic review of monographies. To keep up with the latest developments,  the authors participated in the “4th Conference on Open Access Scholarly Publishing (COASP) 19-21 September 2012”. and give a summary of the session on monographies and open access. http://nile.lub.lu.se/ojs/index.php/sciecominfo/article/view/6126/5254 We hope that you will have a god read.

These resources have been heavily leveraged by scientists in disciplines such as high energy physics, astronomy, and climatology, but until recently they have been little used by biomedical researchers. We suggest that many of the ‘Big Data’ challenges facing the medical informatics community can be efficiently handled using national-scale cyberinfrastructure. Resources such as the Extreme Science and Discovery Environment, the Open Science Grid, and Internet2 provide economical and proven infrastructures for Big Data challenges, but these resources can be difficult to approach. Specialized web portals, support centers, and virtual organizations can be constructed on these resources to meet defined computational challenges, specifically for genomics. We provide examples of how this has been done in basic biology as an illustration for the biomedical informatics community.",2733993499; 2159717700; 2693965603; 2606426640; 2434930588; 2120168719; 2643709547; 2117041051,Richard D.

In terms of Research Data Management, the presentation looks at UCL’s new EU-funded LEARN project and the implications of the new Hague Declaration on Knowledge Discovery in the Digital Age. The paper argues that facts and data should not be constrained by copyright or other IPR legislation, since such legislation was designed to cover the expression of such ideas and facts, not the data themselves. The final part of the presentation looks at the European Commission’s agenda for Science 2.0 (Open Science) and looks at how libraries might embrace aspects of bibliometric analysis and the principles of the new Leiden Manifesto. The role of the Library as publisher is also explored. The presentation concludes by underlining that the challenges of Open Access to publications, Research Data Management and Open Science present real opportunities for research libraries to assume a vital role in the research landscape.",2718538560,P Ayris

This transect of >12,000 km crosses a range of ecosystems from subpolar to tropical, from euphotic shelf seas and upwelling systems, to oligotrophic mid-ocean gyres. The year 2015 has seen two milestones in the history of the AMT: the achievement of 20 years of this unique ocean going programme and the departure of the 25th cruise on the 15th of September. Both of these events were celebrated in June this year with an open science conference hosted by the Plymouth Marine Laboratory (PML) and will be further documented in a special issue of Progress in Oceanography which is planned for publication in 2016. Since 1995, the 25 research cruises have involved 242 sea-going scientists from 66 institutes representing 22 countries. AMT was designed from the outset to be a collaborative programme. It was originally conceived by Jim Aiken, Patrick Holligan, Roger Harris, and Dave Robins with Chuck McClain and Chuck Trees at NASA to test and ground truth satellite algorithms of ocean color. The opportunities offered by this initiative meant that this series of repeated biannual cruises rapidly developed into a coordinated study of ocean biodiversity, biogeochemistry, and ocean/atmosphere interactions.",2439047353; 2683355099; 2027629194; 2120473825; 2659860080; 2597419760,Andrew P.

Actually, transdisciplinary modelling of complex and uncertain environmental systems is challenging computational science (CS) and also the science-policy interface. Large spatial-scale problems falling within this category - i.e. wide-scale transdisciplinary modelling for environment (WSTMe) - often deal with factors for which deep-uncertainty may prevent usual statistical analysis of modelled quantities and need different ways for providing policy-making with science-based support. Here, practical recommendations are proposed for tempering a peculiar - not infrequently underestimated - source of uncertainty. Software errors in complex WSTMe may subtly affect the outcomes with possible consequences even on collective environmental decision-making. Semantic transparency in CS and free software are discussed as possible mitigations. [...]",2752214999,de Rigo Daniele

This discussion is also closely aligned with the need to identify sustainable ways to expand the national research enterprise and to generate actionable results that can be applied to improve the nation’s health. The principles and practices of Open Science offer a promising path to address both goals by facilitating (1) increased transparency of data and methods, which promotes research reproducibility and rigor; and (2) cumulative efficiencies wherein research tools and the output of research are combined to accelerate the delivery of new knowledge in proximal domains, thereby resulting in greater productivity and a reduction in redundant research investments. Objectives: AcademyHealth’s Electronic Data Methods (EDM) Forum implemented a proof-of-concept open science platform for health research called the Collaborative Informatics Environment for Learning on Health Outcomes (CIELO). Methods: The EDM Forum conducted a user-centered design process to elucidate important and high-level requirements for creating and sustaining an open science paradigm. Results: By implementing CIELO and engaging a variety of potential users in its public beta testing, the EDM Forum has been able to elucidate a broad range of stakeholder needs and requirements related to the use of an open science platform focused on health research in a variety of “real world” settings. Conclusions: Our initial design and development experience over the course of the CIELO project has provided the basis for a vigorous dialogue between stakeholder community members regarding the capabilities that will add the greatest value to an open science platform for the health research community. A number of important questions around user incentives, sustainability, and scalability will require further community dialogue and agreement.

Adopting an Open Science approach means the audience for the research can extend beyond the researchers involved to other researchers and to members of the public. Thus, Open Science has implications for engineering research, practice, publishing and public engagement with engineering. This paper reviews the history and evolution of the Open Science movement, includes some reflections on the related areas of Open Access, peer-review and public engagement with science and engineering and discusses data gathered from interviews. The analysis suggests that interviewees have concerns about issues such as precedence and protection of original work and the time needed to integrate open science practices into daily work. Successfully working in such collaborations is likely to require not only common practical tools but also the development of shared language and understanding between researchers and members of the public. Interviewees recognise the value of Open Science in collaborative research and its innovative facility to sustain direct public access to research outputs. It also has the potential to allow members of the public to make real practical contributions to research.",2114433508; 2569957845; 2021395778; 565710005,Ann Grand; C. Wilkinson; K.

In addition, we present data from surveying biomedical researchers and technicians regarding which hypothetical features and functionalities they hope to see implemented in an eLN, and which ones they regard as less important. We also present data on acceptance and satisfaction of those who have recently switched from paper laboratory notebook to an eLN.  We thus provide answers to the following questions: What does an electronic laboratory notebook afford a biomedical researcher, what does it require, and how should one go about implementing it?",288736519; 347718738,Ulrich Dirnagl; Ingo Przesdzing

The TeraGrid team has utilized multiple surveys of user requirements to develop five-year roadmaps describing new capabilities and services, organized into several new initiatives: Deep, Wide, and Open. TeraGrid is managed by the University of Chicago and includes resources at eight partner sites (Argonne National Laboratory, Indiana University, National Center for Supercomputing Applications, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Purdue University, San Diego Supercomputer Center, and Texas Advanced Computing Center).

TeraGrid Deep aims to assist scientists with applications that require the combination of multiple leadership class systems- including TeraGrid storage, computing, instruments, visualization, etc. – working in concert. A team of roughly 15 staff is providing hands-on assistance to application teams pursuing TeraGrid Deep projects.

TeraGrid Wide is a set of partnerships with peer Grid projects and prototype ""science gateways"" that are aimed at making TeraGrid resources available to, and tailored to, entire communities of users. Science gateways are driving policy, process, and technology standards to enable web portals, desktop applications, campus clusters, and other grid infrastructure projects to seamlessly use TeraGrid resources. Initial TeraGrid science gateway projects include community portals and desktop tools supporting life sciences and biomedicine, high-energy physics, neutron science, astronomy, nanotechnology, atmospheric and climate sciences, and environmental and emergency decision-support.

TeraGrid Open involves the rapid evolution of the TeraGrid software and services toward interoperability with peer Grids and campus resources. Currently TeraGrid is partnering with the Open Science Grid as well as partners in Europe (e.g. UK eScience, DEISA) and Asia-Pacific (e.g. Naregi, K*Grid).",2477303955,Charles E. Catlett

However, as a young university created in 2009, King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) needs to aggregate bibliometrics from researchers coming from diverse origins, not necessarily with the proper affiliations. In this context, the University has launched an institutional repository in September 2012 with the objectives of creating a home for the intellectual outputs of KAUST researchers. Later, the university adopted the first mandated institutional open access policy in the Arab region, effective June 31, 2014. Several projects were then initiated in order to accurately identify the research being done by KAUST authors and bring it into the repository in accordance with the open access policy.

Integration with ORCID has been a key element in this process and the best way to ensure data quality for researcher’s scientific contributions. It included the systematic inclusion and creation, if necessary, of ORCID identifiers in the existing repository system, an institutional membership in ORCID, and the creation of dedicated integration tools. In addition and in cooperation with the Office of Research Evaluation, the Library worked at implementing a Current Research Information System (CRIS) as a standardized common resource to monitor KAUST research outputs. We will present our findings about the CRIS implementation, the ORCID API, the repository statistics as well as our approach in conducting the assessment of research impact in terms of usage by the global research community.",2016942106; 2608122820; 2044307403; 2502744436,Mohamed A.

Since OAR@UoM is the first and only online Institutional Repository (IR) on the Maltese Islands, it also plays a major role to promote Open Access (OA) nationally, and to form partnerships with other stakeholders who lack the infrastructure but are interested to deposit in OA. The Outreach department of the University of Malta Library was tasked with promoting OAR@UoM, and also develop training workshops to instruct academics on how to upload their research, whilst providing some background information on OA and the benefits associated. A number of promotional materials were created and disseminated on campus to help increase the awareness of OA and OAR@UoM. During the yearly OA week (October) on Campus, the Library organizes a number of OA related activities,talks and discussions
 
After providing academics with monthly workshops on the benefits of OA and showing them how easy it is to upload on OAR@UoM, only a handful of academics have actually uploaded their publications (or their research outcomes). In 2017, with the OA Policy being in its final stages of approval, the University of Malta Library decided to set up an Open Science department to better organize the workflow related to OA and submission of items on the IR. Thus, the contributions of academics from the UM for the time being depends entirely on their views on the usefulness of the IR. Consultations with local academics on their views on the IR show that the most popular reasons they are mentioning as obstacles for submitting work, are copyright issues or specific agreements with publishers, or not having the time to submit. This is evident from a number of comments from academics during training workshops held between 2014-2017 by library staff members. Since the Open Science department is a relatively new department, the research will look into its creation and development and focus on its impact on the UM research community.This paper will explore the duties and role of the OS department in collaboration with the Outreach department to promote and market OA in Malta.",2751854376,Ryan Scicluna

These sciences seem to be clinging particularly tight to traditional ways of publishing and doing peer review.

The activity utilized resources from sites around the world, including a dozen sites participating to the Open Science Grid consortium (OSG). About 1,500 jobs were run every day across the OSG, consuming and producing hundreds of Gigabytes of data. Access to OSG computing and storage resources was coordinated by the SAM-Grid system. This system organized job access to a complex topology of data queues and job scheduling to clusters, using a SAM-Grid to OSG job forwarding infrastructure. For the first time in the lifetime of the experiment, a data intensive production activity was managed on a general purpose grid, such as OSG.

Research was historically defined as a systematic effort to expand a shared body of knowledge, whereas QA was defined as an effort to ascertain whether a specific project met desired standards. However, the two categories increasingly overlap due to advances in bioinformatics and the shift toward open science. As few ethics review policies take these changes into account, it is often difficult to determine the appropriate level of review. Mislabeling can result in unnecessary burdens for the investigators or, conversely, in underestimation of the risks to participants. Therefore, it is important to develop a consistent method of selecting the review process for genomics and bioinformatics projects. This paper begins by discussing two case studies from the ICGC, followed by a literature review on the distinction between QA and research and a comparative analysis of ethics review policies from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These results are synthesized into a novel two-step decision tool for researchers and policymakers, which uses traditional criteria to sort clearly defined activities while requiring the use of actual risk levels to decide more complex cases.",1973113305; 2466042662; 2256808047; 2660198853; 2754497264; 2138876914; 2161725612; 2186442368; 2068298254,Yann Joly; Derek So; Gladys Osien; Laura Crimi; Martin Bobrow; Don Chalmers; Susan Wallace; Nikolajs Zeps; Bartha Maria Knoppers

The way we interact with and react to digital media, however, has been constantly evolving and there is a clear trend towards implementing device-oriented interactive engagement in a more meaningful way, where users readily add to shaping and creating digital experiences that not only generate added value for them personally, but also for the various other actors involved. This also concerns the interaction with both virtual as well as real-life objects in cultural settings. Across different sectors, creating a complementary synthesis of the digital and analog has been a primary topic, particularly in the course of the 21st century. In this paper we aim to discuss the establishment of cultural innovation networks between museums and other sectors, exemplify potential links between digital and physical objects in connection with a current Digital Humanities project (exploreAT!) and shed light on user engagement possibilities opening towards open innovation research infrastructures (OI-RI).",2769712551; 2404871457; 2562015894; 2297208394; 2346503756,Caitlin Gura; Amelie Dorn; Alejandro Benito; Eveline Wandl-Vogt; Antonio G.

the consumerization of information technology, and the currents school of thought of open

researchers and the ethos of science, academic research traditions and the life cycle of
academic research. For the creation of a methodology for analysis of the actions of
researchers, knowledge management is seen as a discipline that provides the definition of
criteria for the use of emerging technologies for collaboration and the Pyramid of
engagement was used to identify possible actions on the web. Based on theoretical foundation
we develop a methodology for evaluation of academic engagement actions by analyzing
researchers sites and also collaboration by sending an online questionnaire. In its conclusions
identified the diversity of actions of researchers in relation to the forms of engagement and
adoption of digital technologies, in line with the emergence of initiatives related to open science. And suggests directions for further research in Information Science related to the

The simultaneous transitions towards biology as a data science and towards a 'life cycle' view of research data pose new challenges. Researchers face a bewildering landscape of data management requirements, recommendations and regulations, without necessarily being able to access data management training or possessing a clear understanding of practical approaches that can assist in data management in their particular research domain. Here we provide an overview of best practice data life cycle approaches for researchers in the life sciences/bioinformatics space with a particular focus on 'omics' datasets and computer-based data processing and analysis.

For our purposes, OH will be described as a highly adaptable platform for present and future research infrastructures. As part of the contemporary movement for “Open Science,” OH will be examined with respect to its actual and potential contributions to the development of common tools and infrastructures for large-scale scientific collaborations. The primary data we use was gathered by the CERN Knowledge Transfer group in October 2016 through an online survey in addition to face-to-face interviews. Our preliminary findings point to the need for establishing different modes of institutional support beyond
CERN and outside the hobbyist market to help advance cultures of collaborative hardware development in the sciences.",2768340267; 2770483552,Luis Felipe Rosado Murillo; Pietari Kauttu

Nearly half of all clinical trials are never published [2–4]; those that are often exclude important data and may face long delays to publication [5–6], and individual patient level data has rarely been available for re-analysis [7–8]. Moreover, financial conflicts of interest have been associated with actions that have had the potential to bias the conduct and dissemination of clinical research. All of these foundational weaknesses were at issue when a series of publications in the Spine Journal [1] suggested that the investigators behind the key publications supporting rhBMP-2 had significant financial conflicts of interest and that the published reports of these industry-sponsored studies may have incompletely reported important adverse events.

In response to these concerns, Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minnesota) provided the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project with the opportunity to apply its model [9–10] of data transparency and data stewardship to clarify the effectiveness and safety of rhBMP-2. This model entailed the oversight of two independent systematic reviews based on individual patient level data from all clinical trials conducted by Medtronic and the subsequent availability to scientists of the individual patient-level data from the trials. As part of this initiative, Medtronic fully granted jurisdiction over the data to the YODA Project and funded the effort. This project was conceived as a new type of industry-academic partnership to address the problem of unpublished and selectively published clinical evidence, with the hope of advancing open science, developing norms for good stewardship of clinical trial data, and serving patients and society, all while respecting legitimate industry concerns about the use of previously proprietary clinical trial data.",2586713787; 2142156483; 92389296,Jeffrey B.

In spite of marked differences among its different national varieties, a common characteristic of this species can be found in the global monopolization of knowledge. This monopolization involves hierarchical relations among firms and between capital and labor because the capital of some firms includes the exclusive ownership of much of the knowledge used in production. Since the 1994 TRIPS agreements, the growing commoditization of knowledge has extended the role of closed science and closed markets at the expense of open science and open markets. The intrinsic long-term dynamics of this species of capitalism are increasingly characterized by inequality and stagnation. In order to exit from the current crisis, we must change many features of Intellectual Monopoly Capitalism and rely on an eclectic approach that draws insights from the Liberal, the Keynesian and the Marxian traditions",814889553,Ugo Pagano

The hopeful assumption they share is that labs, by building on openness among other features, can generate promising solutions to grand challenges of systemic nature. Despite their seeming proliferation and popularisation, the underlying innovation principles embodied by labs have, however, received scant academic attention. This is a missed opportunity, because innovation labs appear to leverage openness for radical innovation in an unusual fashion. Indeed, in this exploratory paper we draw on original interview data and online self-descriptions to illustrate that, beyond convening “uncommon partners” across organisational boundaries, labs apply the principle of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation and development phases. While the emergence of labs clearly forms part of a broader trend towards openness, we show how it transcends established conceptualisations of open innovation (Chesbrough, 2006), open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012).",2687619491; 2648844338; 2777092474,Lidia Gryszkiewicz; Ioanna Lykourentzou; Tuukka Toivonen

More recently, attention has been focused on aspects such as transparency, quality, and provenance, particularly in regard to data. For industry, citizens, and other researchers to participate in the open science agenda, further work needs to be undertaken to establish trust in research environments. Based on a critical review of the literature, this paper examines the issue of trust in an open science environment, using virtual laboratories as the focus for discussion. A trust framework, which has been developed from an end-user perspective, is proposed as a model for addressing relevant issues within online research data services and tools.",2108267218; 2712238951; 2276817842,Malcolm Perry Wolski; Louise Mary Howard; Joanna Pierce Richardson

Ein Losungsweg liegt in der Ruckbesinnung auf die Idee der Offenheit, des freien Zugangs zu Information und Wissen, fur die Bibliotheken mit dem Ziel der Bildung und Selbstaufklarung gegrundet wurden. Im Idealfall fugen sich durch gemeinsame Wertvorstellungen und damit verbundene technologische Prinzipien die dezentralen Aktivitaten der Bibliotheken in einer Netzwerkstruktur zusammen. Die emanzipatorische Qualitat des Semantic Webs ist bislang weithin unterschatzt und konnte helfen, Grabenkampfe zwischen Protagonisten und Antagonisten der Digitalisierung zu beenden. Die Autoren pladieren fur Bibliotheken als Sachwalter der Offenheit, fur einen freien, uneingeschrankten und globalen Zugang zu wissenschaftlicher Information und fur die Weiterverarbeitbarkeit dieser Information stark machen. Am Beispiel von Dateninfrastrukturen werden konkrete Handlungsschritte diskutiert. Die Autoren fordern mit ihrem Beitrag eine breite Debatte und pladieren grundsatzlich fur mehr Offenheit, Wahlfreiheit und Konsequenz im eigenen Handeln. The current national information service structures are characterized by alliance constraints and lock-in phenomena that effectively block the development of state -of-the-art data infrastructures. A possible solution could be the return to the principle of openness that used to be at the heart of the concept of libraries as institutions of education and enlightenment. Ideally, shared values imply similar technological frameworks and lead to a complementary network of individual activities and services. Up to now the emancipatory quality of the Semantic Web has largely been underestimated. It could help, however, put an end to the trench warfare raging between proponents and detractors of the principle of digitisation. The authors suggest that libraries assume the role of stewards of openness and fight for free, unrestricted and global access to processable scientific information. Taking the example of data infrastructures, they discuss concrete further steps on the way to Open Science. In their article the authors put the case for a broad-based debate and demand greater openness, freedom of choice and consistency in each institution's actions.",2697888983; 2787191521,Felix Lohmeier; Jens Mittelbach

The assessment was completed in January 2018 as part of the Open Science and Research Initiative of the Finnish Ministry of Education and Culture.
The project mapped and evaluated the openness of selected major academic publishers: Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), American Chemical Society (ACS), Elsevier, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE), Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins (LWW), Sage, Springer Nature, Taylor & Francis, and Wiley-Blackwell. The dimensions of publisher openness were summarized in a scorecard of seven key factors, providing a new tool for systematic and standardized evaluation. We used data from the publisher websites to compare the key factors of openness, and the publishers were given a chance to provide comments on the collected information. As complementary sources, we utilized data from commonly acknowledged, open databases: Directory of OA Journals (DOAJ), Gold OA Journals 2011-2016 (GOAJ2), Scopus (title list + Scimago), and Sherpa / Romeo.
The main results include the scorecard and the evaluation of openness of the selected major academic publishers. These are based on seven key factors: (i) Fraction of open access (OA) journals and their articles of the total publication output, (ii) costs of OA publishing (article processing charges, APC), (iii) use of Creative Commons (CC) licensing, (iv) self-archiving policies, (v) access to text and data mining (TDM), (vi) openness of citation data, and (vii) accessibility of information relating to OA practices. To take a look beyond the publisher level into journal level practices we also sampled individual journals. We use the samples to discuss the distribution of journals according to APCs, their licensing and three impact metrics (CiteScore 2016, Scimago Journal & Country Ranks (SJR) 2016, and Source Normalized Impact per Paper (SNIP) 2016).",2787426063; 2239612352; 2604700841; 2786763952; 2786678975,Anna Björk; Juho-Matti Paavola; Teemu Ropponen; Mikael Laakso; Leo Lahti

It begins by sketching current issues in Brexit debates at the end of 2016 as the context into which discussions about open access are then placed. Issues in four thematic areas are analysed: OA policies and mandates, EU copyright reform, new OA publishing models and open science. The level of dependence in the UK on European developments is assessed in each case and its contribution to Brexit issues identified. The paper concludes that Brexit presents not only challenges, but also opportunities which the UK could seize. In open access, the UK is already playing a leadership role. In areas of open science, particularly in relation to the European Open Science Cloud, it is the European Commission which is asserting leadership. The UK needs to consolidate its current activity and ensure that, whatever the nature of Brexit arrangements, its freedom does not lead to isolation.",2607971232,Paul Ayris

Peking University Library started planning the Open Research Data Project at the beginning of 2014. However, it seems that we lacked positive demands from the researchers, necessary institutional level policies and partners to cooperate with. After seeking support both internally and externally, and raising awareness of research data as an important format of academic output, Peking University got granted a NSFC (National Science Foundation of China) project with a part of it goes to development of Research Data Platform. 
With collaboration of the Institution of Social Science Survey and University Research Administration Units and after one year’s development, Peking University Open Research Data Platform launched at the end of 2015. Services provided include completed data capturing, managing and publishing, sharing and storing, DOI registration and authoritative data citing, access and copy right control mechanism, data version archiving, usage statistics, tracking and reporting, online data analysis and visualization plus digital fingerprint, Chinese and English bilingual interface.

With the advent of tools such as IPython Notebooks and Knitr, these notebooks allow code and data to be mixed together and published online. However, these approaches assume that all work is done in the same notebook environment. In this work, we look at generating notebook documentation from multi-environment workflows by using provenance represented in the W3C PROV model.

Specifically, using PROV generated from the Ducktape workflow system, we are able to generate IPython notebooks that include results tables, provenance visualizations as well as references to the software and datasets used. The notebooks are interactive and editable, so that the user can explore and analyze the results of the experiment without re-running the workflow.

We identify specific extensions to PROV necessary for facilitating documentation generation. To evaluate, we recreate the documentation website for a paper which won the Open Science Award at the ECML/PKDD 2013 machine learning conference. We show that the documentation produced automatically by our system provides more detail and greater experimental insight than the original hand-crafted documentation. Our approach bridges the gap between user friendly notebook documentation and provenance generated by distributed heterogeneous components.",2119453698; 2421453920; 2138383528; 2249402561; 2305895654; 2011313876,Adianto Wibisono; Peter Bloem; Gerben Klaas Dirk de Vries; Paul T.

The recent release of large open access chemistry databases generates a demand for flexible tools to process them and discover new knowledge. To freely support open science based on these data resources, it is desirable for the processing tools to be open source and available for everyone. Results: Here we describe a novel combination of the workflow engine Taverna and the cheminformatics library Chemistry Development Kit (CDK) resulting in a open source workflow solution for cheminformatics. We have implemented more than 160 different workers to handle specific cheminformatics tasks. We describe the applications of CDK-Taverna in various usage scenarios. Conclusions: The combination of the workflow engine Taverna and the Chemistry Development Kit provides the first open source cheminformatics workflow solution for the biosciences. With the Taverna-community working towards a more powerful workflow engine and a more user-friendly user interface, CDK-Taverna has the potential to become a free alternative to existing proprietary workflow tools.",2680891074; 2780186156; 210963128; 2695111095,Thomas Kuhn; Egon L Willighagen; Achim Zielesny; Christoph Steinbeck

Since 1996, such an e-Infrastructure is developed and operated in the Czech Republic, with its emphasis shifting from a shared uniform distributed infrastructure to a more user-tailored environment. Its development relates (and in some cases precedes) the evolution of European Grid Infrastructure (EGI), with its current vision of an Open Science Commons concept. While the current e-Infrastructure concept and its implementation is of a very generic nature, it can be tailored to specifically cover different needs of environmental applications. This paper gives an overview of the Czech national e-Infrastructure, its connection to EGI and a number of applications from environmental science domains.",2592382835,Ludek Matyska

In this concept paper, we review a number of opportunities and challenges that can inform the creation of a national bioinformatics training infrastructure capable of servicing the large number of emerging and existing life scientists. While college curricula are slower to adapt, grassroots startup-spirited organizations, such as Software and Data Carpentry, have made impressive inroads in training on the best practices of software use, development, and data analysis.

With the almost global availability of the Internet comes the expectation of universal accessibility to knowledge, including scientific knowledge-particularly that generated by public funding. Currently this is not the case. In this Commentary we discuss access to this knowledge, the politics that govern peer review and publication, and the role of this knowledge as a public good in medicine.

 Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1440 opened an avenue for the distribution of scholarly information to the entire world. The scientific literature first appeared in 1665 with Le Journal des Scavans followed in the same year by Philosophical Transactions. Today there are more than 5000 scientific publishing companies, 25,000 journals and 1.5 million articles published/year generating revenue of $25 billion USD.

 The European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have argued for open access (OA) to scientific data for all publicly funded research by 2020 with a similar initiative in the USA via the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR). However, OA to published science is but one step in this odyssey. If the products of science are not openly available then it can be argued that the norms of science as defined by Merton including “universalism” and “communalism” have yet to be accomplished. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the delivery of medicines to the poor and for rare diseases, the attempts to privatize human genetic information and, not least, dealing with the challenges of antibiotic resistance and new disease pandemics exacerbated by climate change.",1984969895; 254508294,Chris R.

Open science is a method of doing research that lets everyone who has something to say about the subject take part in the problem solving process. 
Already now, the amount of information we gather from observations, theory and modelling is too vast for any one individual to comprehend and turn into knowledge. And the amount of information just keeps growing in the future. A platform that promotes sharing of thoughts and ideas allows us to pool our collective knowledge of white dwarfs and get a clear picture of our research field. It will also make it possible for researchers in fields closely related to ours (AGB stars, planetary nebulae etc.) to join the scientific discourse. 
In the first stage this project would allow us to summarize what we know and what we don't, and what we should search for next. Later, it could grow into a large collaboration that would have the impact to, for example, suggest instrument requirements for future telescopes to satisfy the needs of the white dwarf community, or propose large surveys. 
A simple implementation would be a wiki page for collecting knowledge combined with a forum for more extensive discussions. These would be simple and cheap to maintain. A large community effort on the whole would be needed for the project to succeed, but individual workload should stay at a low level.",2631988974,Tommi Vornanen

With the advancement of genome-sequencing technologies, new genomes are being sequenced daily. Although these sequences are deposited in publicly available data warehouses, their functional and genomic annotations (beyond genes which are predicted automatically) mostly reside in the text of primary publications. Professional curators are hard at work extracting those annotations from the literature for the most studied organisms and depositing them in structured databases. However, the resources don't exist to fund the comprehensive curation of the thousands of newly sequenced organisms in this manner. Here, we describe WikiGenomes (wikigenomes.org), a web application that facilita tes the consumption and curation of genomic data by the entire scientific community. WikiGenomes is based on Wikidata, an openly editable knowledge graph with the goal of aggregating published knowledge into a free and open database. WikiGenomes empowers the individual genomic researcher to contribute their expertise to the curation effort and integrates the knowledge into Wikidata, enabling it to be accessed by anyone without restriction.",2276784258; 2161477694; 2080558691; 2566592584; 2762262459; 2009985931; 1792760558; 2251287563; 2569444445; 1982406386; 2134807814,Timothy E.

Recently changes in scientific communication due to European Commission activities and worldwide are encouraging researches to open science, in particular publications and available data to all communities. These shifts are also reflected in publishing activities of the Slovenian Forestry Institute (SFI). The European project EUFORINNO has offered a financial support to publishers of Acta Silvae et Ligni to focus and intensify activities for improvement of the journal.  Acta Silvae et Ligni is the only Slovenian scientific journal dedicated to publish original or review scientific and professional contributions from the fields of forests, forestry, wood science and technology, forested landscape, nature and the environment. Journal in particular supports the development of scientific and professional terminology in Slovenian language. The journal is published in cooperation of three institutions: the Slovenian Forestry Institute, Department of Forestry and Renewable Forest Resources and Department of Wood Science and Technology at Biotechnical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana. In 2013, with no. 100, its current title has been introduced with the purpose of boosting the internationalization of the journal. Several other changes have also been done on graphical design, home page, policy strategy, open access to bring the journal closer to all levels of readers, and a fully electronic submission system. The journal is under evaluation within two major databases, Web of Science and Scopus. Also the process of obtaining DOI for all articles has been lounged (e.g. membership in a specific DOI organization).  In addition the digitalization process of 643 articles from the Zbornik gozdarstva in lesarstva was conducted and entered into the repository SciVie.  With all these activities we try to enable use and re-use of new and old materials that might otherwise not be readily accessible, and we thus support the advancement of forest research and development.",2704367394; 2266432245; 265236551; 1987111820,Tine Grebenc; Maja Peteh; Tom Levanič; Hojka Kraigher

A high level of government intervention in both the publishing industry and academia and the challenges associated with attempting to make a transition from a centrally controlled towards a more market based publishing industry are two notable differences; however, as in other countries, academic communities and publishers are being transformed by digital technologies. This research explores the complex yet dynamic digital transformation of academic publishing in China, with a specific focus of the open and networked initiatives inspired by Web 2.0 and social media. The thesis draws on two case studies: Science Paper Online, a government-operated online preprint platform and open access mandate; and New Science, a social reference management website operated by a group of young PhD students. Its analysis of the innovations, business models, operating strategies, influences, and difficulties faced by these two initiatives highlights important characteristics and trends in digital publishing experiments in China.

The central argument of this thesis is that the open and collaborative possibilities of Web 2.0 inspired initiatives are emerging outside the established journal and monograph publishing system in China, introducing innovative and somewhat disruptive approaches to the certification, communication and commercial exploitation of knowledge. Moreover, emerging publishing models are enabling and encouraging a new system of practising and communicating science in China, putting into practice some elements of the Open Science ethos. There is evidence of both disruptive change to old publishing structures and the adaptive modification of emergent replacements in the Chinese practice. As such, the transformation from traditional to digital and interactive modes of publishing, involves both competition and convergence between new and old publishers, as well as dynamics of co-evolution involving new technologies, business models, social norms, and government reform agendas.

One key concern driving this work is whether there are new opportunities and new models for academic publishing in the Web 2.0 age and social media environment, which might allow the basic functions of communication and certification to be achieved more effectively. This thesis enriches existing knowledge of open and networked transformations of scholarly publishing by adding a Chinese story.

Themes
During the planning phase of IPY 2007–2008, a number
of major themes emerged from the communitybased
consultation planning. In 2004, the ICSU Planning
Group identified six major research themes outlined in
the ""Framework"" document (Rapley et al., 2004; Chapter
1.3). These major IPY research themes were:
(1) To determine the present environmental status of
the polar regions by quantifying their spatial and
temporal variability.
(2) To quantify and understand past and present
environmental and human change in the polar
regions in order to improve predictions.
(3) To advance our understanding of polar-global
teleconnections on all scales and of the processes
controlling these interactions.
(4) To investigate the unknowns at the frontiers of
science in the polar regions.
(5) To use the unique vantage point of the polar
regions to develop and enhance observatories
studying the Earth’s inner core, the Earth’s
magnetic field, geospace, the Sun and beyond.
(6) To investigate the cultural, historical and social
processes, which shape the resilience and
sustainability of circumpolar human societies, and
to identify their unique contributions to global
cultural diversity and citizenship.
This summary reviews the early ideas and findings
from each of the themes. Our objective is to take stock
of what the IPY scientific community has learned to
date, that is, by the official closing of IPY 2007–2008
at the IPY Open Science Conference in Oslo in June
2010 (Chapter 5.6). The previous chapters outlined
what happened during IPY. Here, we will focus on the
general achievements of the IPY science program. This
summary is deliberately written to avoid referring to
individual IPY projects, program names or specific
activities that have been amply covered in other
sections of this volume (Part 2; Part 3; Chapters 5.2, 5.3,
and 5.4). As is known from previous IPY/IGY efforts
(Chapter 1.1), the major insights will take a substantial
time to emerge. Given the initial stage of analysis and
interpretation of much of the IPY data, this summary
is neither comprehensive nor complete. Also, it uses a
limited number of references, since the main literature
based on the IPY results has not emerged yet. Many
preliminary results (at the time of this writing) were
only available from the abstracts of papers presented
at the Oslo IPY Science Conference in June 2010 (e.g.,
Bell et al., 2010a; Ferracioli et al., 2010; Wiens et al.,
2010).1 Nonetheless, this chapter should be viewed as
a first glimpse of the advances in our inter-disciplinary
(and often, cross-disciplinary) understanding of
the processes and linkages in the polar regions. For
decades, the data collected during IPY 2007–2008 will
support new scientific insights and advances.",2120458397; 2345241272; 2662407602; 2688550948; 2633114533; 2075732191; 2076097222; 2058747524; 2094779876,Robin E. Bell; Ian Allison; K Alverson; K Danell; E Fahrbach; Igor Krupnik; Jerónimo López-Martínez; Eduard Sarukhanian; Colin Summerhayes

While distribution channels of theses and dissertations have changed significantly in the digital age, they are generally still considered grey literature. This opinion paper argues the applicability of the concept of grey to electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). 




Design/methodology/approach




The paper is presented as a debate between two contradictory opinions on the application of the grey literature concept to ETDs.




Findings




The paper provides a definition of grey literature and then discusses its application to electronic dissertations and theses. In particular, it assesses the aspects of acquisition, quality, access, and preservation. Some arguments highlight the “grey nature” of ETDs, such as the limited access via institutional and other repositories. Other arguments (e.g. the development of ETD infrastructures and the quality of ETDs) question this grey approach to ETDs. The paper concludes that “greyness” remains a challenge for ETDs, a problem waiting for solution on the way to open science through the application of the FAIR principles (findability, accessibility, interoperability, reusability).




Research limitations/implications




LIS professionals and scientists should be careful about using the concept of grey literature. The debate will help academic librarians and LIS researchers to better understand the nature of grey literature and its coverage, here in the field of electronic theses and dissertations.




Originality/value




Some definitions from the print age may not be applicable to the digital age. The contradictory character of the debate helps clarify the similitudes and differences of grey literature and electronic theses and dissertations and highlights the challenge of ETDs, in particular their accessibility and findability.",2763989043; 2786054287,Joachim Schöpfel; Behrooz Rasuli

Whilst this information can be obtained directly from the data providers, the resulting formats, temporal aggregations, and vocabularies may not be homogeneous across datasets. Moreover, different data policies hold for the different databases, being only some of them publicly available. Therefore, obtaining and harmonizing multi-model seasonal forecast data for sector-specific applications is an error-prone, time consuming task. In order to facilitate this, the ECOMS User Data Gateway (ECOMS-UDG) was developed in the framework of the ECOMS initiative as a one-stop-service for climate data. To this aim, the variables required by end users were identified, downloaded from the data providers and locally stored as virtual datasets in a THREDDS Data Server (TDS), implementing fine-grained user management and authorization via the THREDDS Access Portal (TAP). As a result, users can retrieve the subsets best suited to their particular research needs in a user-friendly manner using the standard TDS data services. Moreover, an open source, R-based interface for data access and postprocessing was developed in the form of a bundle of packages implementing harmonized data access (one single vocabulary), data collocation, bias adjustment and downscaling, and forecast visualization and validation. This provides a unique comprehensive framework for end-to-end applications of seasonal predictions, hence favoring the reproducibility of the ECOMS scientific outcomes, extensible to the whole scientific community.",1986915573; 2310867164; 2552734138; 2736915853; 2329861231; 2421719320; 2612054883; 2036406513; 2303082645,Antonio S.

Among these developments, three prominent instances — open source software, open access to research and scholarship, and open science — share not only a commitment to the unrestricted exchange of information and ideas, but economic principles based on (1) the efficacy of free software and research; (2) the reputation–building afforded by public access and patronage; and, (3) the emergence of a free–or–subscribe access model. Still, with this much in common, the strong sense of convergence among these open initiatives has yet to be fully realized, to the detriment of the larger, common issue. By drawing on David’s (2004; 2003; 2000; 1998) economic work on open science and Weber’s (2004) analysis of open source, this paper seeks to make that convergence all the more apparent, as well as worth pursuing, by those interested in furthering this alternative approach, which would treat intellectual properties as public goods.",74898719,John Willinsky

A new model of data sharing is emerging, and this issue is becoming more and more crucial for the scientific community and for national and international research policy. As shown by the OECD in 2007, public granting agencies hope that publicly funded research projects would give access to the data produced within their work, in order to provide new resources for economic development. And with the extension of the Open Research Data Pilot in Horizon 2020, H2020 beneficiaries have to make their research data “findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR)”, and are therefore asked to provide a Data Management Plan (or DMP) to this end.

More than a constraint, this new model of openness brings direct benefits for researchers. Sharing their data allows the researchers to organise and retrieve them effectively, to ensure their security, to collaborate with fellow researchers within the same discipline or from other disciplines, to reduce costs by avoiding duplication of data collection, to make easier validation of results, to increase the impact and visibility of their research outputs.",2266223644; 2561698404,Marie Puren; Charles Riondet

ABSTRACT This article analyses the way citizen science as we know it today configures its main aspirations and dynamics as part of an open science system centered on production of and access to data. Seen in this light, we call attention to the risk of citizen science being diverted to a practice of sophisticating data collection and classification and, thus, that the democratic values which underlie the idea of open science become, more than genuine, spectacular. As an alternative, the suggestion proposed – with Alan Irwin (1993) – is to revise the understanding of citizen science as linked to the idea of citizen critique, demand, and confrontation.

There is an increasing demand for accessing data supporting the research results to validate and reproduce them. Therefore universities have to be prepared for this new challenge that goes beyond dissemination because it requires a strategy for managing research data within institutions. In this paper I will try to give some hints on how to deal with this challenge that can be framed in the new open science movement aimed at providing openness in all the whole cycle of research.,2730331504,Ignasi Labastida

We interviewed researchers from a variety of backgrounds about their attitudes towards and experiences with openness in their research practices. We observe a considerable discrepancy between the concept of open science and scholarly reality. While many researchers support open science in theory, the individual researcher is confronted with various difficulties when putting open science into practice. We analyse the major obstacles to open science and group them into two main categories: individual obstacles and systemic obstacles. We argue that the phenomenon of open science can be seen through the prism of a social dilemma: what is in the collective best interest of the scientific community is not necessarily in the best interest of the individual scientist. We discuss the possibilities of transferring theoretical solutions to social dilemma problems to the realm of open science.",287546729; 2720754638,Kaja Scheliga; Sascha Friesike

Moreover, scientific publications are preserved in a digital library archive. It is challenging to identify the data usage that is mentioned in literature and associate it with its source. Here, we investigated the data usage of a government-funded cancer genomics project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), via a full-text literature analysis. Design/methodology/approach: We focused on identifying articles using the TCGA dataset and constructing linkages between the articles and the specific TCGA dataset. First, we collected 5,372 TCGA-related articles from PubMed Central (PMC). Second, we constructed a benchmark set with 25 full-text articles that truly used the TCGA data in their studies, and we summarized the key features of the benchmark set. Third, the key features were applied to the remaining PMC full-text articles that were collected from PMC. Findings: The amount of publications that use TCGA data has increased significantly since 2011, although the TCGA project was launched in 2005. Additionally, we found that the critical areas of focus in the studies that use the TCGA data were glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer, and breast cancer; meanwhile, data from the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) platform is the most preferable for use. Research limitations: The current workflow to identify articles that truly used TCGA data is labor-intensive. An automatic method is expected to improve the performance. Practical implications: This study will help cancer genomics researchers determine the latest advancements in cancer molecular therapy, and it will promote data sharing and data-intensive scientific discovery. Originality/value: Few studies have been conducted to investigate data usage by governmentfunded projects/programs since their launch. In this preliminary study, we extracted articles that use TCGA data from PMC, and we created a link between the full-text articles and the source data.",2389029423; 2297236888; 2495488828; 2477835614,Jiao Li; Si Zheng; Hongyu Kang; Zhen Hou Qing Qian

We provide an overview of three main modes of direct interaction between firms and universities: IP licensing, research services and research partnerships. We outline the main characteristics of each mode, its relative importance for firms as well as benefits and challenges. While licensing remains an important mode in which public research finds its way into firms laboratories, we highlight the significant role of relationship-based modes of interaction which include research services and research partnerships ­ between firms and universities. While some of these relationship-based interactions enable appropriation via intellectual property rights, others are more aligned with the norms of open science and create benefits for firms by generating basic knowledge, creating skills and enabling follow-on innovation. We conclude with open questions for future research.",35765227; 2162692397,Markus Perkmann; Joel West

In addition, there is a significant ongoing R&D activity focused on future upgrades of the STAR detector, which also requires extensive simulations support. In addition to the local computing facility, the Open Science Grid (OSG) resources have been successfully used in STAR. However, the explosive growth of both computational needs and the available computing power, combined with distributed nature of the latter, dictate that all available options are considered - from open source to commercial grids. The computing facility of Sun Microsystems (the SunGrid) aims to deliver enterprise computing power and resources over the Internet, enabling developers, researchers, scientists and businesses to optimize performance and speed time to results without investment in IT infrastructure.",2764450169; 2764677285; 2713547112; 2229834207; 2057778522,J Lauret; M Potekhin; G Carcassi; A Shamash; R Valia

There exist various technologies, tools and infrastructure that facilitate collaborative production processes in various social spheres, and scientific production is not an exception. Open science produces scientific knowledge in a collaborative way, including experts and non-experts and to share the outcomes of knowledge creation processes. We identify 68 open science initiatives in Argentina using different primary and secondary sources. This paper describes those experiences in terms of goals, disciplines and openness along research stages. Building on the relationship between characteristics of openness and expected benefits, we discuss policy implications in order to better support openness and collaboration in science.",2726369863; 2733658224; 2731993829,Valeria Arza; Mariano Fressoli; Sol Sebastian

Using bibliometric and altmetric indicators, it seeks to analyze the impact and subsequent use of their scholarly works on social and scientific platforms. Fifty-five authors with the highest productivity were identified, based on the results of bibliometric studies on InfoLit carried out on both an international and Ibero-American scale in searches of major databases as well as publications collected in a Latin American wiki. Subsequently an analysis of bibliometric and altmetric indicators at the author and publication level was carried out, based on the results of searches on eight scientific platforms (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley, ORCID, IraLIS, E-LIS and EXIT), three social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and data provided by a commercial supplier (Altmetric.com). Overall we found a greater presence of authors in ResearchGate (58%), Academia.edu (51%) and Google Scholar (49%) as opposed to Mendeley (25%) and ORCID (18%). Furthermore, as to social platforms, the greatest potential influence lies with Facebook, due to its high number of followers ( / top 10 authors). In addition, an analysis with the Spearman rho statistic, shows among some sources and platforms, a low correlation between the number of citations in Google Scholar and readings in Mendeley (r = 382) and low negative for mentions in blogs (r = 0,-237), Google+ (r = 0, -214) and Twitter (r = 0, -183). In conclusion, both the productivity and the impact-visibility center on specific authors writing about InfoLit, and various measurement resources show that for these authors there is a positive two-way impact from bibliometric to altmetric and vice versa.",2711608781; 2741015752,Alejandro Uribe-Tirado; Joel Alhuay-Quispe

However, a research data management (RDM) service does not exist in Japan. Therefore, at the National Institute of Informatics (NII), we developed the next-generation RDM on a national scale by using the open science framework (OSF). We combined the RDM with the existing NII worldwide cyberinfrastructure services (SINET and GakuNin) and OSF add-ons for external Cloud services and institutional repositories. Finally, we displayed the first closed trial for nationwide RDM services in seven universities and a national research institute for research integrity; this helped promote open science in Japan in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. NII and participant organizations obtained some RDM operating know-how and discovered new issues by follow-up meetings.

Responses are provided by Axel Cleeremans, Yasuko Kitano, Cornelius Weber and Stefan Wermter, Justin Hart and Brian Scassellati, Juyang Weng, Guy Hoffman and Moran Cerf. Several dimensions of the question stand out. First, as we are very far from understanding what “consciousness” is, it appears that building robots capable of various forms of self- and other- aware- ness, and importantly how they can develop these capabilities progressively, can be very useful in the quest to unveil the underly- ing mechanisms. Second, as consciousness is a multiscale complex systems, multiple approaches and perspectives need to be taken in this process of robot building. Third, when one looks at applications, it is the function, and not the nature, of consciousness which becomes the relevant angle of analysis, and several ethical questions arise.",2781006728,Pierre-Yves Oudeyer

While these policies spark the promise of transparency, an open data program is an effective gateway to a larger data and technology strategy. Governments can use portals to convene a tech community consisting of entrepreneurs, professionals in information technology from large enterprises, and civic activists. The blend of the technology components and grassroots culture is necessary for governments to function as a platform. Yet, open data can achieve more than transparency and GaaP services. By leveraging open data and applying the principles of open access and open science, governments can collaborate with external researchers to implement analytic, stochastic research models that improve the efficiency of city operations and help advise on data-driven policy. Governments can leverage technologies such as open source software and distributed version control to share research with others, inviting review through reproducible research and also inviting improvements. In order to be successful, there must be a alignment between the governments internal technology stack and it’s edifice to the public. We will discuss lessons from building a broad data strategy inclusive of open data, advanced analytics a la open science, internal technology systems, and necessary culture to iterate toward an collaboration between governments, the public, researchers, and private enterprise.?",2714676308,Tom Schenk

Using data on U.S. Research and Development laboratories, that quantify spatial aspects of learning about universities and firms as well as their locations, I find that academic spillovers are more localized than industrial spillovers. I also find that localization is increased by nearby stocks of R&D, but reduced by laboratory and firm size. These results on localized academic spillovers reflect open science and the industry-university cooperative movement, which encourage firms to work with local universities, so that localization coincides with the public goods nature of science. This situation contrasts with relations to other firms, where contractual arrangements are needed to access proprietary information, often at a considerable distance.",2764093273,James D. Adams

This involvement in science can be understood as an issue of access to publications, code, and data that facilitates public engagement in the research process, thus appropriate policy to support the associated welfare enhancing benefits is essential. Current legal barriers to citizen participation can be alleviated by scientists' use of the ""Reproducible Research Standard,"" thus making the literature, data, and code associated with scientific results accessible. The enterprise of science is undergoing deep and fundamental changes, particularly in how scientists obtain results and share their work: the promise of open research dissemination held by the Internet is gradually being fulfilled by scientists. Contributions to science from beyond the ivory tower are forcing a rethinking of traditional models of knowledge generation, evaluation, and communication. The notion of a scientific ""peer"" is blurred with the advent of lay contributions to science raising questions regarding the concepts of peer-review and recognition. New collaborative models are emerging around both open scientific software and the generation of scientific discoveries that bear a similarity to open innovation models in other settings. Public engagement in science can be understood as an issue of access to knowledge for public involvement in the research process, facilitated by appropriate policy to support the welfare enhancing benefits deriving from citizen-science.",2602354082,Victoria C.

In the Open Science Grid (OSG), privileges are granted on the basis of the user's membership to a Virtual Organization (VO). However, user privilege definitions and enforcements are administered separately by VOs and Grid sites. Such partitioning can potentially introduce inconsistent user privileges throughout the Grid and break the Grid paradigm of uniform access to resources. There is a need for an automated privilege management mechanism for a VO to codify privilege policies granted to its users, to propagate the policies to grid sites, to identity and suggest remedies for non-supported VO privileges at individual sites. The Scalable Virtual Organization Privileges Management Environment (SVOPME) addresses the challenge under the context of the Open Science Grid (OSG). The SVOPME provides tools for VOs to define and publish desired privileges. At a site, SVOPME tools help analyze access policies defined for VO users and verify policy consistency between VOs and sites, and suggest site configurations changes. This paper presents the designs and features of SVOPME tools and the lessons learned in applying SVOPME tools for OSG VOs and sites. Furthermore, we will outline future improvements to SVOPME tools to adapt to a range of different site configurations and new privilege policies.",25894833; 2719624678; 2714839988; 2091181715; 2674454772,Gabriele Garzoglio; Nanbor Wang; I.

This study is based on 22 in-depth interviews with U.K. researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics, which were conducted between September 2013 and February 2014. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts, we identify seven core themes that characterize researchers’ understanding of openness in science and nine factors that shape the practice of openness in research.

First, how scientists currently use SWMSs was determined through a comprehensive usage survey examining 1455 research publications from 2013 to July 31st, 2015. To understand how data-intensive scientists are producing impactful research, we further examined usage of two major research clouds, the Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC) and Cornell's Red Cloud.

To address the questions I create an online survey that will be used to find trends among the researchers, and augment the survey results with interviews to get a deeper understanding behind the reasons for these trends.

Lindberg, MD, after 31 years from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), the National Institutes of Health director, Francis Collins, MD, PhD, charged the NLM working group to articulate a new, strategic vision for the NLM. The NLM has been a tremendous supporter of informatics, and this new report provides insight into the role that NLM will play in the future. It articulates a vision for how the NLM can continue to be a trustworthy source of biomedical data and information, an advocate for open science, a promoter of the next generation of data scientists, a protector of the legacy of the past, and a vital partner for those who are generating biomedical knowledge for the future.

The NLM working group put out a request for information (RFI) (see http://www.nlm.nih.gov/news/nih\_rfi\_nlm\_working\_group.html) and received over 650 responses both domestically and internationally.1 The training programs and programs that provided access to medical information such as PubMed …",686635164,Douglas B.

The purpose of this paper is to propose a personal viewpoint on the development of document supply in the context of the recent European Union (EU) decisions on open science.

Design/methodology/approach
The paper provides some elements to the usual questions of service development, about business, customers, added value, environment and objectives.

Findings
The EU goal for open science is 100 per cent available research results in 2020. To meet the challenge, document supply must change, include more and other content, serve different targets groups, apply innovative technology and provide knowledge. If not, document supply will become a marginalized library service.

Originality/value
Basically, open science is not library-friendly, and it does not offer a solution for the actual problems of document supply. But it may provide an opportunity for document supply to become a modern service able to deal with new forms of unequal access and digital divide.",2763989043,Joachim Schöpfel

A large debate resulted on the possible trade-off between the increased benefits for the direct transfer of knowledge from university to industry and the risks of reduction of quality and diffusion of university knowledge. The theoretical principles of alternative paradigms of public research should be taken into account and more empirical studies on the problem should be conducted and implemented in order to avoid that the debate becomes merely ideological. This paper makes a synthetic review of the more relevant fields of empirical research on these topics and signals some directions of theoretical research which are particularly interesting for the future.",2733674329,Roberto Iorio

Despite the availability of various petascale machines currently, the steps and lessons from their deployment are rarely described in the literature. This paper presents the experiences observed during the deployment of Blue Waters, the largest supercomputer ever built by Cray and one of the most powerful machines currently available for open science. The presentation is focused on the final deployment steps, where the system was intensively tested and accepted by NCSA. After a brief introduction of the Blue Waters architecture, a detailed description of the set of acceptance tests employed is provided, including many of the obtained results. This is followed by the major lessons learned during the process. Those experiences and lessons should be useful to guide similarly complex deployments in the future.",2121470861; 2168161180; 2229094847; 2225784136; 2786045138; 2590115993,Celso L. Mendes; Brett M.

The Open Data Movement, like other Open philosophies, aims he goal of making immediately ""accessible to anyone the primary research data, without limitation of copyright, patent or other control mechanisms"". In this work we try to analyze some interesting statements made by different stakeholders operating in the context of the Open Data, in order to clarify a system of behaviors, often subject to ambiguity and sometimes manipulation. The experts are divided in considering Open Data a derivation of Open Government or a derivation of Open Science, but in both cases the context is the digital environment. Between these two Open territories, we could place a third place, that connects them and that is called Open Bibliographic Data or OpenBiblio: this middle place includes OPACs, databases and open archives. Speaking of Open Data means to place the defining elements within the framework of the Open Knowledge, in a dimension of knowledge that must analyse also the issue of Open Data licenses, which are different from the best-known Creative Commons. The Open Data shares its objectives and developments, in particular with reference to the Open Linked Data project, which deals with interoperability between different data sources and formats. Hence the title chosen for this work: Open Data con LODe, LinkedOpenData, where the final ""e"", for us, means something immersed, ""embedded"" within the system itself. The real meaning belongs to the context of the Open Library, and in particular belongs to the Recommendations LODe BD, drawn up by the AIMS team of FAO, and it applies the concept of LOD-enabled bibliographic data, where the ""e"" has the meaning of something ""enabled"". It's not sufficient to apply a license in order to make a resource ""open"", but the resource must also be ""open"" in terms of real and effective interoperability, avoiding the use of licenses only as something fashionable. In this work our aim is not to be completely exhaustive in the definition process, but our purpose is simply to analyse the issue within a framework that seems sometimes rich as well as chaotic.",2681411963; 2469344750,Antonella De Robbio; Silvia Giacomazzi

In this new trend so-called open science, we focus on collaborative work between citizens and scientists. In the present article, we call this collaboration crowd science. We hypothesized that an ideal collaborative relation can be developed from three elements: selections of appropriate topics of scientific projects, appropriate locations and opportunities for citizen-scientist interactions, and well-organized methodologies of the collaborations. To practice and develop this style of the crowd science, we have been organizing two annual workshops, the KYOTO Open Science Workshop in 2016 and 2017. The workshops were held at MTRL KYOTO outside universities, and were designed both for researchers and citizens. In the second workshop in 2017, we employed so-called ideathon technique to develop a survey project of alien slugs as an example. In the ideathon, participants proposed feasible plans to enhance the project, and researchers would not come up with such plans. Questionnaire results showed that 73% of participants had been motivated to the crowd science. We found that the above three fundamental elements induced citizens collaborative motivation to crowd science. We will continue this attempt to build a collaborative relationship between academic experts and citizens who participate in science.",2769650980; 2769242201; 2769901583,Eiri Ono; Yuko Ikkatai; Teruaki Enoto

The referee consensus solver deployed to the Open Science Grid [3,4] was used for this task. The dataset includes demographic and screening measures, a high-resolution MRI scan of the brain, and whole-head magnetoencephalographic (MEG) recordings during eyes closed rest (560 sec), a simple task (540 sec), and passive listening/viewing (140 sec). The data were collected from 619 neurologically normal individuals, ages 18–87. The processed results from the resting recordings are completed and available for download at http://stash.osgconnect.net/+krieger/. These constitute ≈1.7 TBytes of data including the location within the brain (1 mm resolution), time stamp (1 msec resolution), and 80 msec time course for each of 3.7 billion validated neuroelectric events, i.e. mean 6.1 million events for each of the 619 participants. The referee consensus solver provides high yield (mean 11,000 neuroelectric currents/sec; standard deviation (sd): 3500/sec) high confidence (p −12 for each identified current) measures of the neuroelectric currents whose magnetic fields are detected in the MEG recordings. We describe the solver, the implementation of the solver deployed on the Open Science Grid, the workflow management system, the opportunistic use of high performance computing (HPC) resources to add computing capacity to the Open Science Grid reserved for this project, and our initial findings from the recently completed processing of the resting recordings.

Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encouraging authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars – they cannot reliably tell the difference between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon – quality uncertainty – has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals’ reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts. The public expects transparency from science, and appropriately so – we should be held to a higher standard than used car salespeople.",60271087,Simine Vazire

More specifically, the FOSTER objectives are to: 
•	Support different stakeholders, especially young researchers, in adopting open access in the context of the European Research Area (ERA) and in complying with the open access policies and rules of participation set out for Horizon 2020; 
•	Integrate open access principles and practice in the current research workflow by targeting the young researcher training environment; 
•	Strengthen the institutional training capacity to foster compliance with the open access policies of the ERA and Horizon 2020 (beyond the FOSTER project); 
•	Facilitate the adoption, reinforcement and implementation of open access policies from other European funders, in line with the EC’s recommendation, in partnership with PASTEUR4OA project. 
As stated in the project Description of Work (DoW) these objectives will be pursued and achieved through the combination of 3 main activities: content identification, repacking and creation; creation of the FOSTER Portal; delivery of training. 
The core activity of the Task T2.1 will be to define a basic quality control protocol for content, and map available content by target group, and content type in parallel with WP3 Task 3.1. 

Training materials include the full range of classical (structured presentation slides) and multi-media content (short videos, interactive e-books, ) that clearly and succinctly frames a problem and offers a working solution, in support of the learning objectives of each target group, and the range of learning options to be used in WP4 (elearning, blended learning, self-learning). 

The map of existing content metadata will be delivered to WP3 for best choice of system requirements for continuous and sustainable content aggregation, enhancement and content delivery via “Tasks 3.2 e-Learning Portal” and “Task 3.4 Content Upload”. The resulting content compilation will be tailored to each Target Group and delivered to WP4.",2122372975; 1975327188; 2165572607; 2125733128; 2776457135,Joy Davidson; Iryna Kuchma; Vanessa Proudman; Astrid Orth; Sarah Jones

The core or behavioral kernel of simulation tool presented here represents the effects of the reputational reward structure of OS/FS communities (as characterized by Raymond 1998) to be the key mechanism governing the probabilistic allocation of agents’ individual contributions among the constituent components of an evolving software system. In this regard, our approach follows the institutional analysis approach associated with studies of academic researchers in “open science” communities. For the purposes of this first step, the focus of the analysis is confined to showing the ways in which the specific norms of the reward system and organizational rules can shape emergent properties of successive releases of code for a given project, such as its range of functions and reliability. The global performance of the OS/FS mode, in matching the functional and other characteristics of the variety of software systems that are produced with the needs of users in various sectors of the economy and polity, obviously, is a matter of considerable importance that will bear upon the long-term viability and growth of this mode of organizing production and distribution. Our larger objective, therefore, is to arrive at a parsimonious characterization of the workings of OS/FS communities engaged across a number of projects, and their collective productive performance in dimensions that are amenable to “social welfare” evaluation. Seeking that goal will pose further new and interesting problems for study, a number of which are identified in the essay’s conclusion. Yet, it is argued that that these too will be found to be tractable within the framework provided by refining and elaborating on the core (“proof of concept”) model that is presented in this paper.",2660059130; 2584665884,Jean-Michel Dalle; Paul A.

From computational models of organelles, cells, and simple organisms, to physiological models of tissues, organ systems, and ecosystems, a diverse array of biological systems have been the target of large-scale computational modeling efforts. Nonetheless, these research agendas have yet to prove decisively their value among the broader community of theoretical and experimental biologists. In this commentary, we examine a range of philosophical and practical issues relevant to understanding the potential of integrative simulations. We discuss the role of theory and modeling in different areas of physics and suggest that certain sub-disciplines of physics provide useful cultural analogies for imagining the future role of simulations in biological research. We examine philosophical issues related to modeling which consistently arise in discussions about integrative simulations and suggest a pragmatic viewpoint that balances a belief in philosophy with the recognition of the relative infancy of our state of philosophical understanding. Finally, we discuss community workflow and publication practices to allow research to be readily discoverable and amenable to incorporation into simulations.

It presents a methodology for the definition and classification of the content of Institutional Repositories that will be useful to outline the standards of comprehensive, comparable and defined outputs, to select those corresponding to the different mission and institutional activities carried out by research organizations (Universities and Public Research Institutions). The research question is: what is the value of the Institutional Repositories for the evaluation of public research organizations even beyond research activities? What kinds of output should an Institutional Repository contain to respond to both scientific requirements and comparability assumptions in the evaluation process, besides the sharing capacity and the flexibility inherent to the notion of Open Science? Through a case study on a specific Institutional Repository (CNR National Council), the paper proposes a conceptual framework to address the research questions, which is supposed to contribute outreach purposes, evaluation and sharing of science.",2765355104; 2766702672,Serena Fabrizio; Emanuela Reale

However, closer inspection of the open-ended questions found the respondents often differed in the use of the nomenclature. In particular, the respondents found it difficult to define knowledge exchange in this context. It is hoped that this initial study will form the foundation of future work in this area, and that it will help to further develop the debate regarding the need for a consistent nomenclature across science communication.",1901784002; 2154643821; 2070610044; 2692789104,Samuel Illingworth; James Redfern; Steve Millington; Sam Gray

Previous studies have found that multiple barriers can impede the effectiveness and efficiency by which academic research is commercialized. This case study was designed to better understand the impediments to research commercialization at the University of Kentucky via a survey and interview with three successful academic entrepreneurs. The study also garnered insight from the individuals as to how the commercialization process could be improved. Issues with commercialization infrastructure; a lack of emphasis, at the university level, on the importance of research commercialization; a void in an entrepreneurial culture on campus; inhibitory commercialization policies; and a lack of business and commercialization knowledge among faculty were highlighted as the most significant barriers. The research subjects also suggested that commercialization activity may generally increase if a number of factors were mitigated. Such insight can be communicated to the administrative leadership of the commercialization process at the University of Kentucky. Long term, improving university-based research commercialization will allow academic researchers to be more active and successful entrepreneurs such that intellectual property will progress more freely to the marketplace for the benefit of inventors, universities and society.",53375224; 2529501955,Nathan L.

In the paper we present an approach to designing an EL environment that can satisfy these Open Science challenges. The proposed approach is based on a concept of scientific objects-for-reuse that circulate throughout a research community by a mechanism specially designed to improve their scientific usage and to collect quality data about usage characteristics. This is achieving by development of EL tools, by establishment of research data and information spaces (DIS) and by implementing online research infrastructure at the national level. Currently in Russia the approach has a pilot implementation called the Socionet. We expect essential benefits and clear added value by integrating this approach with a national research assessment information system aimed to improve evaluation of researchers and scientific organizations.",2682219505,Sergey Parinov

Its intent is to make academic research more transparent, collaborative, accessible, and efficient. In the present article, we examine the origins, various forms, and understandings of this movement. Furthermore, we put the aims of individual groups associated with Open Science and the academic realities of their concepts into context. We discuss that much of what is known as Open Science can be viewed through the prism of a social dilemma. From this perspective, we explain why the concept of Open Science finds a lot of support in theory, yet struggles in practice. We conclude the article with suggestions on how to foster more Open Science in practice and how to overcome the obstacles it is currently facing. 1",2760869382; 2591675802,Sascha Friesike; Thomas Schildhauer

Due to its intensive resource requirements, the scientific workflows are often executed on distributed platforms, including campus clusters, grids and clouds. In this paper we build a scientific workflow for blast2cap3, the protein-guided assembly, using the Pegasus Workflow Management System (Pegasus WMS). The modularity of blast2cap3 allows us to decompose the existing serial approach on multiple tasks, some of which can be run in parallel. Afterwards, this workflow is deployed on two distributed execution platforms: Sandhills, the University of Nebraska Campus Cluster, and the Open Science Grid (OSG). We compare and evaluate the performance of the built workflow for the both platforms. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of the number of clusters of transcripts in the blast2cap3 workflow over the total running time. The performed experiments show that the Pegasus WMS implementation of blast2cap3 significantly reduces the running time compared to the current serial implementation of blast2cap3 for more than 95 %. Although OSG provides more computational resources than Sandhills, our workflow experimental runs have better running time on Sandhills. Moreover, the selection of 300 clusters of transcripts gives the optimum performance with the resources allocated from Sandhills.",322676148; 7791215; 2147107919; 2144498669; 2071234966; 335256981,Natasha Pavlovikj; Kevin Begcy; Sairam Behera; Malachy T.

Often founded by young researchers after realizing the lack of digital tools for researchers, these startups bring new tools to conduct experiments, manage laboratories, or explore the literature. Many of these tools use so-called cloud technologies, developed in the early 2000s to make complex software cheaply, rapidly, and easily accessible through the user's web browsers.

This poses challenges due to the social boundaries that separate communities. In this chapter, I explore how specially designed boundary organizations can facilitate cooperation across social boundaries and, thereby, support knowledge integration. I present an inductive study of the Structural Genomics Consortium, a boundary organization operating at the interface between academia and industry. The findings suggest that the boundary organization enabled cooperation by intervening both structurally and cognitively. Structurally, it managed and maintained the social boundary between academia and industry, thereby reducing the potential for conflict and allowing for multilateral decision-making. Cognitively, it created a cosmopolitan interpretive scheme that appealed to participants from diverse settings and maintained their motivation. Compared to previous research on boundary organizations that has focused on their structural interventions, we stress that establishing a cognitive scheme broad enough to align with multiple communities is important for facilitating lasting cooperation across social boundaries.",35765227,Markus Perkmann

Any restriction on data and on its re-use limits any progress of research and communities development. Between Open Science and Open Government, we can place a third place that connects them both and that concerns the meta information. This middle land is called Open Bibliographic Data or OpenBiblio.

Instruments, reagents, computers, and other equipment are essential for producing systematic knowledge. Yet, current supply chains limit access and impede creativity and customization through high mark-ups and proprietary designs, compounded by proprietary hardware licenses and patents. Open Science Hardware (OSH) addresses part of this problem by sharing designs, instructions for building, and protocols. Expanding the reach of OSH within academic research, NGO initiatives, citizen science, and education has potential to increase access to experimental tools and facilitate their customization and reuse. We organized with others the “Gathering for Open Science Hardware” (GOSH) in 2016 to address what we see as the primary barrier to OSH: early adopters are disparate and separated by geographical and disciplinary borders which limit interaction, exchange and community building. This inaugural gathering brought together 50 of the most active developers, users, and thinkers in the OSH movement, complemented by expertise from diverse backgrounds, to seed a global community. This article provides a review of the activities and debates we conducted at GOSH 2016.",2647757820; 45941769; 2480982830,Shannon Dosemagen; Max Liboiron; Jenny Molloy

In production since 2006 at FNAL, it was adopted by the Open Science Grid as a distributed, grid-wide accounting system in 2007. Since adoption Gratia's next challenge has been to adapt to an explosive increase in data volume and to handle several new categories of accounting data. Gratia now accounts for regular grid jobs, file transfers, glide-in jobs, and the state of grid services. We show that Gratia gives access to a thorough picture of the OSG and discuss the complexity caused by newer grid techniques such as pilot jobs, job forwarding, and backfill.",2764749867,Philippe Canal

Commodifying knowledge as is currently done with journals, is not sustainable any longer. An alternative is the commodification of how information is consumed. By focusing on the commodification of consumption instead of commodification of the resource, the problem of access to knowledge can be resolved in a sustainable manner. Additionally, commodification of consumption removes several perverse incentives from the scholarly system that now produce unreliable knowledge. The main tenet underlying the themes of Open Access, Open Data, Open Science, and replication initiatives in scholarly communication is sustainability through transparency of the scholarly process in all facets. The sustainability of any networked system is threatened by single points of failure (i.e., the entire system can be manipulated from one node in the network). The scholarly process is ridden with such single points of failures at all stages. Distributing the scholarly communications system would remove the problems of single points of failure. Distributing and decentralizing the scholarly communications system is achievable with newly developed peer-to-peer (p2p) Internet protocols. Alongside decentralization and distribution of the content, integrity of the scholarly record can also be reformed to transform sections of a paper into different, reusable nodes of knowledge. These nodes can be logged on a blockchain based ledger of which everyone can have a copy. In order to deposit nodes onto the ledger, the depositor needs to agree that the contents are licensed CC 0, in order to maximize legal certainty regarding reuse of the contents. This is key to create a sustainable eco-system where scholars and companies can cooperate instead of compete, as we currently do.",2758708241,Chris H.J. Hartgerink

The interpretation of such an extensive collection of samples in their ecological context requires means to explore, assess and access raw and validated data sets. To address this challenge, the Tara Oceans Consortium offers open science resources, including the use of open access archives for nucleotides (ENA) and for environmental, biogeochemical, taxonomic and morphological data (PANGAEA), and the development of on line discovery tools and collaborative annotation tools for sequences and images.

The hopeful assumption they share is that labs, by building on openness among other features, can generate promising solutions to grand challenges of systemic nature. Despite their seeming proliferation and popularisation, the underlying innovation principles embodied by labs have, however, received scant academic attention. This is a missed opportunity, because innovation labs appear to leverage openness for radical innovation in an unusual fashion. Indeed, in this exploratory paper we draw on original interview data and online self-descriptions to illustrate that, beyond convening “uncommon partners” across organisational boundaries, labs apply the principle of openness throughout the innovation process, including the experimentation and development phases. While the emergence of labs clearly forms part of a broader trend towards openness, we show how it transcends established conceptualisations of open innovation (Chesbrough et al., 2006), open science (David, 1998) or open government (Janssen et al., 2012).",2772201861; 2772449388; 2775218378,L Gryszkiewicz; I Lykourentzou; Thi Toivonen

We argue that open-source collaboration coordinates the division of labor through the exchange of effort rather than of products: suppliers of effort self-identify in the same way as suppliers of products in a market rather than accepting assignments like employees in a firm. We suggest that open-source software (and other) projects are neither bazaars nor cathedrals, but hybrids manifesting both voluntary production and conscious planning.",622314658; 1269671142,Richard N.

There is a wealth of knowledge hidden in this huge amount of articles, but reading and analysing all of them manually is not humanly possible. Text and data mining (TDM) can provide a solution. It can process millions of texts quickly and reveal patterns and trends that can lead to new discoveries in various fields, for example in research analytics, medicine, agriculture and social sciences.

Joseph Schumpeter claimed that new combinations are consequential only when they have been successfully commercialized. The capacity to privatize knowledge is, moreover, a powerful stimulus to innovation. This paper reexamines the Ayresian and Schumpeterian positions using evidence from the Bayh Dole experiment. The Bayh Dole Act, which gave universities title to inventions resulting from federally-sponsored research, created a laboratory wherein the trade-offs between diminution of the appropriable knowledge fund (due to patenting) and incentives to commercialization can be appraised.",2625098356,Christopher Brown

The main findings include: publishing in high-impact factor journals is the only reputational game in town; online scholarly communities, and ResearchGate in particular, are gaining ground; social media are beginning to have an impact, especially in the dissemination arena; outreach activities have become more important; libraries are becoming increasingly invisible to ECRs; Open Science is not gaining traction; and more transformational ideas are being expressed, especially in the US and UK.",2054145023; 2298748623; 2465376622; 2584153463; 2663197024; 2196743485; 1997790263; 2103310103,David Nicholas; Anthony Watkinson; Chérifa Boukacem-Zeghmouri; Blanca Rodríguez-Bravo; Jie Xu; A.

The code resulting from each hackathon is published at https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/ with separate directories or repositories for each team.",2599953394; 2530586391; 2659301230; 2563589188; 2274757954,Ben Busby; Matthew Lesko; August; January Hackathon participants; Lisa Federer

Demands on early career researchers are increasing. They not only need to excel academically but must also compete for funding with well-established researchers, foster collaborations, and communicate their research to a diverse audience of colleagues, peers, and funding agencies within and outside of their own disciplines and countries. Representatives from funding agencies and research councils including the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.K. Natural Environment Research Council (NERC), Antarctica New Zealand, IASC, and SCAR ran sessions and panel discussions focusing on key skills in writing proposals, conducting remote and logistically complex fieldwork, communicating their science, and improving research productivity.

It will do so vis-a-vis current citation conventions and impact measurement for research in AHSS. Case study findings on research data inventoried at Goldsmiths’, University of London will be presented. Goldsmiths is a UK research-intensive higher education institution which specialises in arts, humanities and social science research. The paper’s aim is to raise awareness of the subject-specific needs of AHSS scholars to help inform the design of future digital tools for impact analysis in AHSS.

Firstly, I shall explore the definition of research data and how it is currently understood by AHSS researchers. I will show why many researchers choose not to engage with digital dissemination techniques and ORCID. This discussion must necessarily include the idea that practice-based and applied AHSS research are processes which are not easily captured in numerical ‘sets’ and cannot be labelled electronically without giving careful consideration to what a group or data item ‘represents’ as part of the academic enquiry, and therefore how it should be cited and analysed as part of any impact assessment.

Then, the paper will explore: the role of the monograph and arts catalogue in AHSS scholarship; how citation practices and digital impact measurement in AHSS currently operate in relation to authorship and how digital identifiers may hypothetically impact on metrics, intellectual property (IP), copyright and research integrity issues in AHSS.

I will also show that, if we are to be truly interdisciplinary, as research funders and strategic thinkers say we should, it is necessary to revise the way we think about digital research dissemination. This will involve breaking down the boundaries between AHSS and other types of research.",2751807890,Muriel Swijghuisen Reigersberg

The paper is based on a presentation made at the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research Open Science Conference in Auckland 2014. In this study, diaries have been used from the German “Gauss”-Expedition (also known as the “German South Polar Expedition”), led by Erich von Drygalski and the British “Discovery”-Expedition (also known as the “British National Antarctic Expedition”), led by Robert Falcon Scott. Both expeditions were undertaken during the period from 1901 through 1904. The timeframe is of particular interest, because it is a time when the men who went south did not have reliable comparative accounts in order to adequately mentally prepare for what they were about to experience.

There is a need for comprehensive, balanced and flexible distributed cyberinfrastructure (DCI) in support of science and engineering applications. A fundamental technical challenge is to support a broad range of application usage scenarios and modalities on a range of platforms with varying performance. The current generation of DCI has resulted in important scientific results as well as advances in the state-of-practice of delivering DCI as services to the user community, broadly defined. However, a complete conceptual framework for DCI design principles remains prominent by its absence. This missing framework prevents an objective assessment of important technical as well as policy considerations.

The SCREAM workshop generally aims to address this gap, and specifically aims to understand, through a combination of experience, application requirements, and conceptual models, how to best to create a conceptual framework for the objective design and assessment of distributed cyberinfrastructure. In other words, it aims to build toward the science of cyberinfrastructure upon what has hitherto been a purely empirical approach to cyberinfrastructure design and practice. The SCREAM Workshop is interested in all areas that will further this objective, in particular the interaction of multiple cyberinfrastructure components and systems (distributed computing, broadly defined), including academic and commercial production systems and research testbeds.

Significant effort has been invested in the delivery and practice of DCI with different objectives and varying capabilities, and existing (Open Science Grid, XSEDE, GENI, EGI, PRACE, DAS-n) and previous offerings have yielded valuable information. Enough experience now exists to reflect on what has worked and why, and why some approaches have failed. Thus, we believe the time is appropriate to build upon these lessons towards a next generation of DCI that is designed and architected for well-defined usage modes, performance and capabilities.

Although primarily targeted towards computing scientists, we believe this workshop will have an impact beyond the computing specialist in light of the fact that production cyberinfrastructure impacts the effectiveness of other science & engineering endeavors. This workshop welcomed technical contributions delivered via research-based results, experience papers, and vision papers. Understanding the principles and science of cyberinfrastructure has impact beyond just the computing aspects.

The call for papers attracted 12 submissions with authors from Asia, Canada, Australia, Europe, and the United States. The papers received an average of 4.9 reviews each. As a new workshop seeking to promote discussion, we were generous in our decisions, accepting 8 of the papers, for a 66.7% acceptance rate.

We also encourage attendees to attend the keynote and invited talk presentations, and the closing panel. These valuable and insightful talks can and will guide us to a better understanding of the future:

These days, it is virtually impossible to pick up a popular science magazine and not find something about bioinformatics. Although there is currently no widely agreed upon definition for the term ""bioinformatics"", it may be defined as ""the application of computing power to biological data to reveal new patterns and information below the surface of those data."" (1) Bioinformatics is currently being applied to a number of scientific areas including chemistry, genomics, brain mapping, pharmacology, proteomics and structural biology. A key aspect of these new bioinformatic technologies is the creation and maintenance of databases for the storage of biological information. In addition, stemming from the enormous growth over the past two decades in the amount of biological information available to scientists, including the success of the Human Genome Project, is the urgent need for the interpretation, integration and analysis of such information. This integrative aspect of bioinformatics is important in determining the meaning and usefulness of the data, and involves tasks such as locating particular genes in the genome sequences of a variety of organisms, creating methods to predict the structure or function of gene sequences, grouping protein sequences into families of similar or related sequences, and comparing and aligning protein sequences in order to identify evolutionary relationships. (2) A practical example of this integrative aspect of bioinformatics is using a computer program to analyze gene sequence data in order to determine how a gene related to a particular disease is turned on or off in the cell. This type information would be very useful in the realm of drug discovery and development. The ability to use bioinformatics to organize, analyze or make predictions from data collected in the lab has had a major impact on biological research by reducing the time required to find solutions to certain biological questions. (3) With this potential to dramatically reduce the time to discover an important drug or treatment for a disease, it is not surprising that in the last few years a great deal of intellectual and financial resources, both in the private and public arenas, have been poured into the development of bioinformatic tools, particularly in the areas of genomics and proteomics. With this influx of money and intellectual effort into the study of bioinformatics, the issue of intellectual property protection for these new technologies is an important one to consider. While existing forms of legal protection may be already be available for some bioinformatics technologies, the question arises as to whether the existing law needs to be expanded, and whether new forms of protection should be introduced, in order to ensure adequate protection for those parties involved in commercial research endeavours. These questions become more difficult to answer when one considers the extent to which the advancement of the science of bioinformatics depends on the open and collaborative sharing of data and research tools. That is, with increased intellectual property protection, it is possible that the notion of ""open science"" in bioinformatics will be unattainable, and such an outcome may have many profound effects on future discoveries in bioinformatics. This paper will attempt to provide a discussion of some key intellectual property issues in bioinformatics, including a consideration of how such proprietary issues may impact the science of bioinformatics as a whole. Intellectual Property Protection in Bioinformatics Bioinformatics has clearly emerged as a key player in the realm of biomedical sciences and pharmaceuticals. The bioinformatics field continues to grow rapidly, and companies investing time and money in this area will likely see the need for adequate intellectual property protection for such technologies as a key issue. …",2689658034,Suneeta D'Souza

To showhow and why attacks spread more readily around the grid, we ﬁrst discuss how collaborationsmanifest themselves in the grids and how this collaboration model affects the security riskmodel of grid participants. We present a new grid model and use optimization techniques tocalculate the security risk associated with each grid participant.

Since the “Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science” was published in April 2016, there is supposed to be “a clear panEuropean target: from 2020 all new publications are available through open access from the date of publication”. This call falls into a line of events, in which demands for a more rapid or even radical transition towards full Open Access world experienced a considerable accumulation. With the “OA2020” initiative launched shortly before and the conclusions on the transition towards an Open Science system adopted by the Council of the European Union in late spring of the same year the whirl of excitement seemed to reach its peak. Yet more than a year later a universal consensus on a “one size fits all”-type solution as proposed by a widely debated and promoted white paper of the Max Planck Digital Library has still to prevail. Not only have country or institution-specific case studies which set out for a challenge to quantify potential benefits and disadvantages of such a scenario for themselves delivered mixed results and propositions. Some of the “most eminent” research institutions and nations seem to even back track from their initially stringent Gold-only Open Access transition roadmaps. Unsurprisingly, long-standing Open Access advocates and scholars like Stevan Harnad and Jean-Claude Guedon have repeatedly pointed out that Green, Gold and any other new alternative Open Access models should be seen as complementary strategies and encouraged further experimentation with respect to flexibility and adaptation to local circumstances. Thus, this talk will try to address the perceived “either-or” dilemma in many of recent initiatives and to take a closer look at some of their arguments and underlying assumptions. What it is expected to deliver will be a rather more differentiated and colourful picture of current Open Access transitions and visions.",2767955306,Elena Šimukovič

The transformation from a subscription based journal market to a fee-based Open Access publishing requires a monitoring of  APC expenditures. This is not only necessary to ensure price transparency on a developing APC market. In fact funding organizations, library consortia and other stakeholders need a valid data base to be able to evaluate Open Access funding policies or transformation strategies. The presentation will give a short overview about existing initiatives to collect APC data and will then introduce the new project “INTACT  - Transparent Infrastructure for fee-based Open Access publishing”. The project, which is funded by the “German Research Foundation” (DFG) and supported by the “DINI working group Electronic Publishing” is a cooperation of Bielefeld University Library, the “Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies of Science” (I2SoS) at Bielefeld University and the Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL). The INTACT approach combines a bibliometric analysis of fee-based Open Access publishing in academic institutions with establishing a standardised reporting and open data service for APC data. By working together with the ESAC initiative ( http://esac-initiative.org/ ), the project wants to increase the efficiency of Open Access publishing workflows in universities and research organizations together with leading Open Access publishers. INTACT uses Open Science workflows for aggregation, use and reuse of APC data. Even before  the official start, 21 german universities and 5 research society funds are providing their data into a GitHub-Repository ( http://openapc.github.io/ ), the datasets are available under a Open Database License. Due to DFG funding policy for Open Access publication funds in Germany, the whole dataset releases  currently information on more than 3.200 articles in real open access journals, which charge publication fees, and total expenditures for more than 4 million EURO. But information about Open Access articles in toll-access journals (""hybrid"") are provided as well. Further more, the presentation discusses basic requirements for creating an international network for analyzing and monitoring fee-based Open Access publishing.",2653500836,Dirk Pieper

The following partners participated in the project: Aalborg University Library, Danish e-Infrastructure Cooperation (DeIC), DTU Library, Roskilde University Library, The Danish National Archives, Royal Danish Library and The University Library of Southern Denmark. The general objective of the project was to establish a Danish setup covering all aspects of the lifecycle of research data: from application, through the research phase, and finally to the dissemination of results and sharing of research data. The setup was to be based on researchers’ demands, and the suggestions and results of the project were to be at an international level.

That is not as contradictory as it sounds, or at least it shouldn’t be.While the conventional wisdom is that most scientific findings have been vetted and reproduced many times before they reach scientific consensus, the reality is that such rigor is exceedingly rare. Nosek sought to remedy this, wrangling up a group of 270 other researchers (The Open Science Collaboration) and attempting to redo 100 psychology experiments already published in leading peer reviewed journals. The question: would these recreations find the same results as the initial studies? Prior to Nosek’s endeavor, the conventional wisdom was that while published science contains some false positives, they are a small minority and are quickly identified through a robust self-correction process. The conventional wisdom was wrong, and to an extent most never dreamed of – only 36% of the studies were reproducible.In this article I first provide a brief review of the legal standard for the admission of scientific evidence. Then, I provide the context in which Nosek’s findings sit – the replicability crisis. I suggest the current legal standard is capable of effectively screening out unreliable science, but it requires legal actors be aware of the issue and demand science’s best rather that what’s been generally accepted. I conclude with some tangible recommendations for the justice system.",2713244574,Jason Michael Chin

Welcome to SciDAC 2006 and Denver. I share greetings from the new Undersecretary for Energy, Ray Orbach. Five years ago SciDAC was launched as an experiment in computational science. The goal was to form partnerships among science applications, computer scientists, and applied mathematicians to take advantage of the potential of emerging terascale computers. This experiment has been a resounding success. SciDAC has emerged as a powerful concept for addressing some of the biggest challenges facing our world. As significant as these successes were, I believe there is also significance in the teams that achieved them. In addition to their scientific aims these teams have advanced the overall field of computational science and set the stage for even larger accomplishments as we look ahead to SciDAC-2. I am sure that many of you are expecting to hear about the results of our current solicitation for SciDAC-2. I'm afraid we are not quite ready to make that announcement. Decisions are still being made and we will announce the results later this summer. Nearly 250 unique proposals were received and evaluated, involving literally thousands of researchers, postdocs, and students. These collectively requested more than five times our expected budget. This response is a testament to the success of SciDAC in the community. In SciDAC-2 our budget has been increased to about $70 million for FY 2007 and our partnerships have expanded to include the Environment and National Security missions of the Department. The National Science Foundation has also joined as a partner. These new partnerships are expected to expand the application space of SciDAC, and broaden the impact and visibility of the program. We have, with our recent solicitation, expanded to turbulence, computational biology, and groundwater reactive modeling and simulation. We are currently talking with the Department's applied energy programs about risk assessment, optimization of complex systems – such as the national and regional electricity grid, carbon sequestration, virtual engineering, and the nuclear fuel cycle. The successes of the first five years of SciDAC have demonstrated the power of using advanced computing to enable scientific discovery. One measure of this success could be found in the President's State of the Union address in which President Bush identified 'supercomputing' as a major focus area of the American Competitiveness Initiative. Funds were provided in the FY 2007 President's Budget request to increase the size of the NERSC-5 procurement to between 100–150 teraflops, to upgrade the LCF Cray XT3 at Oak Ridge to 250 teraflops and acquire a 100 teraflop IBM BlueGene/P to establish the Leadership computing facility at Argonne. We believe that we are on a path to establish a petascale computing resource for open science by 2009. We must develop software tools, packages, and libraries as well as the scientific application software that will scale to hundreds of thousands of processors. Computer scientists from universities and the DOE's national laboratories will be asked to collaborate on the development of the critical system software components such as compilers, light-weight operating systems and file systems. Standing up these large machines will not be business as usual for ASCR. We intend to develop a series of interconnected projects that identify cost, schedule, risks, and scope for the upgrades at the LCF at Oak Ridge, the establishment of the LCF at Argonne, and the development of the software to support these high-end computers. The critical first step in defining the scope of the project is to identify a set of early application codes for each leadership class computing facility. These codes will have access to the resources during the commissioning phase of the facility projects and will be part of the acceptance tests for the machines. Applications will be selected, in part, by breakthrough science, scalability, and ability to exercise key hardware and software components. Possible early applications might include climate models; studies of the magnetic properties of nanoparticles as they relate to ultra-high density storage media; the rational design of chemical catalysts, the modeling of combustion processes that will lead to cleaner burning coal, and fusion and astrophysics research. I have presented just a few of the challenges that we look forward to on the road to petascale computing. Our road to petascale science might be paraphrased by the quote from e e cummings, 'somewhere I have never traveled, gladly beyond any experience . . .'",2764789418,Michael Strayer

Some international publishers have been active in moving towards open access publications and research data, but, overall, modest results have been achieved so far. In this context, the digital piracy engines emerge as vital actors in disseminating and determining the impact of research. This study examines the Sci-Hub downloads data in order to uncover patterns of piracy in European Studies research. We identify journals and the subjects of articles that have been pirated the most. We also study the geographical distribution of download requests.

In spite of marked differences between its national varieties, a common characteristic of this species can be found in the global monopolisation of knowledge. This monopolisation involves hierarchical relations among firms and between capital and labour, because the capital of some firms includes the exclusive ownership of much of the knowledge used in production. Since the 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreements, the growing commoditisation of knowledge has extended the role of closed science and closed markets at the expense of open science and open markets. The intrinsic long-term dynamics of this species of capitalism is increasingly characterised by financialisation, inequality and stagnation. In order to exit from the current crisis, we must change many features of intellectual monopoly capitalism and rely on an eclectic approach that draws insights from liberal, Keynesian and Marxian traditions.",814889553,Ugo Pagano

Within the Open Science discussions, the current call for “reproducibility” comes from the raising awareness that results as presented in research papers are not as easily reproducible as expected, or even contradicted those original results in some reproduction efforts. In this context, transparency and openness are seen as key components to facilitate good scientific practices, as well as scientific discovery. As a result, many funding agencies now require the deposit of research data sets, institutions improve the training on the application of statistical methods, and journals begin to mandate a high level of detail on the methods and materials used. How can researchers be supported and encouraged to provide that level of transparency? An important component is the underlying research data, which is currently often only partly available within the article. At Elsevier we have therefore been working on journal data guidelines which clearly explain to researchers when and how they are expected to make their research data available. Simultaneously, we have also developed the corresponding infrastructure to make it as easy as possible for researchers to share their data in a way that is appropriate in their field. To ensure researchers get credit for the work they do on managing and sharing data, all our journals support data citation in line with the FORCE11 data citation principles – a key step in the direction of ensuring that we address the lack of credits and incentives which emerged from the Open Data analysis (Open Data - the Researcher Perspective https://www.elsevier.com/about/open-science/research-data/open-data-report ) recently carried out by Elsevier together with CWTS. Finally, the presentation will also touch upon a number of initiatives to ensure the reproducibility of software, protocols and methods. With STAR methods, for instance, methods are submitted in a Structured, Transparent, Accessible Reporting format; this approach promotes rigor and robustness, and makes reporting easier for the author and replication easier for the reader.",282417996,Federica Rosetta

With the introduction of the open source ResearchKit, Apple provides a framework for researchers to inform and consent research subjects, and to readily collect personal health data and patient reported outcomes (PRO) from distributed populations. However, being research backend agnostic, ResearchKit does not provide data transmission facilities, leaving research apps disconnected from the health system. Personal health data and PROs are of the most value when presented in context along with health system data. Our aim was to build a toolchain that allows easy and secure integration of personal health and PRO data into an open source platform widely adopted across 140 academic medical centers. We present C3-PRO: the Consent, Contact, and Community framework for Patient Reported Outcomes. This open source toolchain connects, in a standards-compliant fashion, any ResearchKit app to the widely-used clinical research infrastructure Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2). C3-PRO leverages the emerging health data standard Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR).",2116922498; 2506467668; 2065310590; 638079112,Pascal B. Pfiffner; Isaac Pinyol; Marc D.

Examine in detail, from a variety of perspectives, how the world of research is changing and the impact these changes have on the direction of research libraries. 2. Create an informed vision of how research libraries can be a vital partner to researchers. 3. Suggest a strategic approach for realizing this vision.

We find that large firms are more likely to have cooperative agreements with universities. These agreements are formed whenever risk is not an important obstacle to innovation, and typically serve to share costs. Consistent with the open science paradigm, we find no evidence for the importance of the capacity to appropriate the returns from innovation for explaining cooperative agreements with universities. We do argue that cooperating with universities is complementary to other innovation activities such as performing own R&D, sourcing public information and cooperative agreements with suppliers and customers. Therefore, the decision to cooperate with universities cannot be analysed in isolation from the overall innovation strategy of the firm.",668474162; 2710887126,Reinhilde Veugelers; Bruno Cassiman

Survey responses required respondents to consider their learning before and during the use of the open textbook. The survey included quality and presentation of content questions, as well as an opportunity for students to explain their responses.

This has become known as the ""Data Fusion"" task, and has great promise in dealing with the vast quantity of unstructured textual data that is a feature of many Big Data scenarios. However, no universally-accepted evaluation methodology has emerged in the community. This makes it difficult to make meaningful comparisons between the various proposed techniques from reading the literature alone. Variations in the datasets, metrics, and baseline results have all contributed to this difficulty. 
This paper argues that a more unified approach is required, and that a centralised software platform should be developed to aid researchers in making comparisons between their algorithms and others. The desirable qualities of such a system have been identified and proposed, and an early prototype has been developed. Re-implementing algorithms published by other researchers is a great burden on those proposing new techniques. The prototype system has the potential to greatly reduce this burden and thus encourage more comparable results being generated and published more easily.",2787084676; 2785641055; 2786407228; 2154164700,Weinan Huang; Junyi Chen; Lei Meng; David Lillis

Gradually, the Initiative was joined by numerous international projects and launched in the European Union, Russia, United States, Canada, Japan, and China. Currently, serving as an umbrella for more than 130 individual research projects (always with international participation) and with a $15M annual budget, this highly diverse initiative is in full swing. Since the first NEESPI focus issue (Pavel Groisman et al 2007 Environ. Res. Lett. 2 045008 (1pp)) in December 2007, several NEESPI Workshops and Sessions at International Meetings have been held that strengthen the NEESPI grasp on biogeochemical cycle and cryosphere studies, climatic and hydrological modeling, and regional NEESPI components in the Arctic, non- boreal Eastern Europe, Central Asia, northern Siberia, and mountainous regions of the NEESPI domain. In May 2009, an overview NEESPI paper was published in the Bulletin of the American Meteorological Society (BAMS) (Pavel Groisman et al 2009 Bull. Am. Met. Soc. 90 671). This paper also formulated a requirement to the next generation of NEESPI studies to work towards attaining a higher level of integration of observation programs, process studies, and modeling, across disciplines. Three books devoted to studies in different regions of Northern Eurasia prepared by the members of the NEESPI team have appeared and/or are scheduled to appear in 2009. This (second) ERL focus issue dedicated to climatic and environmental studies in Northern Eurasia is composed mostly from the papers that were presented at two NEESPI Open Science Sessions at the Annual Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (December 2008, San Francisco, CA) and at the General Assembly of the European Geosciences Union (April 2009, Vienna, Austria), as well as at the specialty NEESPI Workshops convened in Jena, Helsinki, Odessa, Urumqi, Krasnoyarsk, St Petersburg, and Bishkek during the past two years. As in the first NEESPI focus issue, papers that make up this second issue can be divided into five major topics: climate and hydrology; land cover and land use; the biogeochemical cycle and its feedbacks; cryosphere; human dimension. However, this partitioning is less rigid compared to the partitioning in the first Issue. Following the requirement of a higher level of integration outlined in the BAMS paper, many papers in this issue respond to two or even three of the topics listed above.",321181029; 2018549976,Pavel Ya.

Researchers could recruit research participants and conduct research directly on the OSP, if desired, using readily available tools. Researchers could create private or shared workspaces to house data, access tools, and computation and could publish data directly on the platform or publish elsewhere with persistent, data citations on the OSP. This manuscript describes the details of an Open Science Platform and its construction. Having an Open Science Platform will especially impact the rate of new scientific discoveries and make scientific findings more credible and accountable. ",2776908812; 906928525,Latanya Sweeney; Mercè Crosas

It has been claimed by many critics, however, that this ‘entrepreneurial turn’ presents conflicts with long established academic norms, procedures, and reward systems. This paper utilizes a national survey of faculty attitudes towards academic entrepreneurship to investigate the extent to which the ‘entrepreneurial turn’ has become accepted and taken-for-granted, to identify which academic entrepreneurial activities are deemed appropriate, or legitimate, and those that are widely regarded as inappropriate, and to identify the most salient dimensions by which faculty attitudes vary. The results provide evidence that the entrepreneurial turn within research universities in the US has not yet become ‘taken-for-granted’, that the norm of open science is still widely accepted and conflicts with some academic entrepreneurship activities. There seems to be a broad—though not consensual—agreement on the boundaries of what are deemed appropriate and legitimate entrepreneurial activities that spans disciplines and across prior levels of faculty experience in academic entrepreneurship.",2780161519,Harvey A.

The concretion of this framework of RRI has been articulated by the EC around six key areas: governance, public engagement, gender equality, science education, open access, and open science and ethics. The indicators to measure these dimensions have been proposed recently. In our opinion the set of indicators available so far has two weaknesses: a lack of context-based indicators and a need for hierarchical ordering. Our aim is to provide tools for policy- and decision-makers that might need to identify the more important indicators in a specific context. In this work, we explored how the multicriteria analysis technique Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) can be used to prioritize indicators for RRI by involving experts in the specific context. The AHP method allowed weighting indicators according to experts in the different areas and producing four different options to select indicators. The method of AHP can be an appropriated instrument to select the most suitable indicators for RRI policies and initiatives.",2769050261; 1520018798; 2768229481,Irene Monsonís-Payá; Mónica García-Melón; José-Félix Lozano

New quality of scientific communication processes is based first of all on the development of e-resources which are open and freely accessible to everyone who needs them for research, didactics, other professional activities or personal development. The openness of resources does not mean that they are not protected by law. Authors’ rights are protected and the openness of documents results from the authors’ will not to reserve all their rights. Maturity of Open Access movement manifests also in world-wide scientific lobby noticeable in business and political environment. It has introduced to the systems of science new vision of the essence and ownership of science and its resources.

Yet little is known how scientists resolve such trade-offs. Using survey data from 1,400 junior life scientists, we find considerable heterogeneity in the ?price? scientists assign to publishing when they consider research positions in industry that allow versus restrict publishing, including scientists who are willing to give up publishing ?for free?. Analyzing sources of heterogeneity, we find that the required wage premium increases with a scientist?s preference for publishing but decreases with the preference for money. Scientists who value publishing primarily as a currency in the labor market require a smaller wage premium, ceteris paribus, than scientists who value publishing as a mechanism to advance scientific knowledge, presumably reflecting different degrees of substitutability between publishing and pay. Finally, ability and the quality of training have a positive relationship with the required wage premium. We discuss implications for research on the economics of science, for managers seeking to attract and retain academically trained scientists, and for firms considering their participation in ?open science?.",2168976755; 2748543318,Michael Roach; Henry Sauermann

Our premise in this paper is that MSE projects require integrated information management at their inception. Such efforts will lead to improved communication and sharing of knowledge among diverse project participants, better science outcomes, and more transparent and accessible (ie “open”) science. We encourage researchers to “complete the data life cycle” by publishing well-documented datasets, thereby facilitating re-use of the data to answer new and different questions from the ones conceived by those involved in the original projects. The practice of documenting and submitting datasets to data repositories that are publicly accessible ensures that research results and data are available to and use-able by other researchers, thus fostering open science. However, ecologists are often unfamiliar with the requirements and information management tools for effectively preserving data and receive little institutional or professional incentive to do so. Here, we provide recommendations for achieving these ends and give examples from current MSE projects to demonstrate why information management is critical for ensuring that scientific results can be reproduced and that data can be shared for future use.",2701716629; 2016211335; 2311244916; 1983089787; 262382334; 2140376468; 163800374; 2136305093; 2165185706,Janine Rüegg; Corinna Gries; Ben Bond-Lamberty; Gabriel J.

Authors submitting their research to either BMC Ecology or BMC Evolutionary Biology will now have the opportunity to deposit their data directly into the Dryad archive and will receive a permanent, citable link to their dataset. Although this does not affect any of our current data deposition policies at these journals, we hope to encourage a more widespread adoption of open data sharing in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology by facilitating this process for our authors. We also take this opportunity to discuss some of the wider issues that may concern researchers when making their data openly available. Although we offer a number of positive examples from different fields of biology, we also recognise that reticence to data sharing still exists, and that change must be driven from within research communities in order to create future science that is fit for purpose in the digital age.

As part of the newly integrated medical school curriculum, the principles of open science and open dissemination of scholarly content are taught in courses as well as through practical experience. Students are afforded opportunities to work on publishing projects, including journals, books, and content applications.

In 2015, as a response to the lack of a shared monitoring and evaluation system for CGIAR Research Programs (CRPs), Dryland Systems met the needs of participating institutions by developing the online platform Monitoring, Evaluation & Learning (MEL). MEL is an interoperable multi-program, multi-functional system that collates, synthesizes, analyses, disseminates and reports information generated in four multi-institution CRPs and Programs (Dryland Systems, Roots, Tubers and Bananas, Dryland Cereals, Grain Legumes and the IFAD funded program). The platform comes with MELSpace, an integrated Open Access repository based on D-Space that boosts the projects outreach. Carved in the system is the Knowledge Sharing tool-set, which includes exportable lists of publication, project dedicated web-pages and a communication-friendly module to write and disseminate project related blog & outcome stories. The Open Facts provide the users with open, multi-filter indicators on funds, capacity development, impact pathways and more. The vision behind MEL is to power its implementing institutions by bringing the M&E process to the next level, ensuring an optimal and synergic data flow, based on Open Science and FAIR principles. MEL is the result of the synergic efforts by CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Systems (CRP-DS), CGIAR Research Program on Roots, Tubers and Bananas (CRP-RTB), CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Cereals (CRP-DC), CGIAR Research Program on Grain Legumes (CRP-GL), The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), The International Potato Center (CIP), The World Agroforestry Center (ICRAF), ICARDA Geoinformatics Unit (GIS), and is powered by iMMAP, Codeobia, D-Space and Amazon Web Services.",2774290441; 2774416813; 2772759287; 2774361436; 2771710690,Valerio Graziano; Holly Anne Holmes; Claudio Proietti; Enrico Bonaiuti; Sara Jani

While the scientific utility of replications is unquestionable, the impact of failed replication efforts and the discussions surrounding them deserve more attention. Specifically, the debates about failed replications on social media have led to worry, in some scientists, regarding reputation. In order to gain data-informed insights into these issues, we collected data from 281 published scientists. We assessed whether scientists overestimate the negative reputational effects of a failed replication in a scenario-based study. Second, we assessed the reputational consequences of admitting wrongness (versus not) as an original scientist of an effect that has failed to replicate. Our data suggests that scientists overestimate the negative reputational impact of a hypothetical failed replication effort. We also show that admitting wrongness about a non-replicated finding is less harmful to one’s reputation than not admitting. Finally, we discovered a hint of evidence that feelings about the replication movement can be affected by whether replication efforts are aimed one’s own work versus the work of another. Given these findings, we then present potential ways forward in these discussions.",1936111401; 317322364,Adam K. Fetterman; Kai Sassenberg

A decision looms, and the patient waits with some trepidation. A doctor soon appears and pulls up a chair, prepared for the discussion by having conscientiously reviewed the medical literature, examined the evidence-based systematic reviews, and highlighted the relevant information. The ensuing conversation reflects on the patient's treatment goals and the published information about the benefits and harms of the available options. The tension breaks with a decision, and plans for the next steps are put in place.

Every day, patients and their caregivers are faced with difficult decisions about treatment. They turn to physicians and other healthcare professionals to interpret the medical evidence and assist them in making individualized decisions.

Unfortunately, we are learning that what is published in the medical literature represents only a portion of the evidence that is relevant to the risks and benefits of available treatments. In a profession that seeks to rely on evidence, it is ironic that we tolerate a system that enables evidence to be outside of public view. Those who own data, usually scientists or industry, have the choice of what, where, and when to publish. As a result, our medical literature portrays only a partial picture of the evidence about clinical strategies, including drugs and devices. Experts have recently drawn attention to this issue, including contributions in this issue of our journal, but there is resistance to change.1–5

Research efforts in the field of descriptive and predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships or Quantitative Structure–Property Relationships produce around one thousand scientific publications annually. All the materials and results are mainly communicated using printed media. The printed media in its present form have obvious limitations when they come to effectively representing mathematical models, including complex and non-linear, and large bodies of associated numerical chemical data. It is not supportive of secondary information extraction or reuse efforts while in silico studies poses additional requirements for accessibility, transparency and reproducibility of the research. This gap can and should be bridged by introducing domain-specific digital data exchange standards and tools. The current publication presents a formal specification of the quantitative structure-activity relationship data organization and archival format called the QSAR DataBank (QsarDB for shorter, or QDB for shortest).",54352800; 189871638; 86349249,Villu Ruusmann; Sulev Sild; Uko Maran

Norms and practices of openness, arguably, have been vital for the work of modern scientific communities, but concerns about the growth of stronger technical and institutional restraints on access to research tools, data and information recently have attracted increased notice -- in part because of their implications for the effective utilization of advanced digital infrastructures and information technologies in research collaborations. Our discussion clarifies the conceptual distinctions between e-science and open science, and reports findings from a preliminary look at practices in U.K. e-science projects. Both parts serve to underscore the point that it is unwarranted to presume that the development of e-science necessarily promotes global open science collaboration.

Open access to medical publications has the potential to boost the timely and widespread dissemination of new research findings and, ultimately, to have a more immediate impact on clinical practice than traditional publishing methods. However, several aspects of open access publishing remain to be discussed and clarified by the scientific community; among these is the value and process of open peer review.

The value of peer review to editors and authors is well established in the traditional biomedical publication model. Most authors and editors would agree that a fair and thoughtful manuscript review by experts with considerable knowledge in a given research area is helpful to editors in judging the importance of the research question studied and the appropriateness of the methodology used. Moreover, experienced peer reviewers usually make instructive comments as to whether the authors’ conclusions are supported by their data and whether their findings have been put in the wider context of what is already known about their research question.

However, editors of several influential biomedical journals have expressed concern regarding various aspects of the peer review of submitted manuscripts, including whether generally accepted review processes are adequate to ensure appropriate and fair evaluation, and have called for more quantitative and qualitative studies on the issue.1-3 Editors sometimes make decisions about submitted manuscripts irrespective of the peer reviewers’ comments; this occurs for a variety of reasons, including the fact that some peer reviews are not particularly helpful.4 Nevertheless, traditional peer review has been considered an indispensable part of the editorial evaluation process —until such time as a more effective and fair system is developed and successfully applied in scientific publishing.1

Although the value of a strong peer review process is felt to extend to the open access publication model,5 at least one study has raised the concern that some new open access journals may have a less rigorous manuscript evaluation process than traditional subscription journals.6 If this is so, it may reflect an expectation that post-publication review through open, published discourse will be swift and effective. However, while all manner of electronic journals are experimenting with reader input on published material, little is known about the scientific value of post-publication review in the modern era of open access publishing. Several questions arise. Can new capacities for open comment really assume the responsibilities, thoroughness and overall judgement of formal peer review? Are they being set up and structured in this way? It is noteworthy that the multidisciplinary journal Nature closed its recent open peer review experiment, although it should be noted that this “open” movement has differences regarding type of publisher as well access to the data and peer review process compared to that of other publishers such as the Public Library of Science (PLoS) for instance.7

In second-generation open access journals such as PLoS ONE there is a more intense emphasis on open post-publication review (after an initial technical review of the paper’s scientific quality) as a means of enabling early publication. This approach makes a greater proportion of submissions available to readers to assess for themselves. Discourse can begin immediately regarding the methodological aspects of a study and the significance and implications of its findings, as compared with traditional journals, where reaction to an article usually takes the form of letters to the editor published at a later date. It should be mentioned that in some first-generation open access journals there has been the opportunity to quickly react to a publication using the “rapid response” electronic system.

In-depth peer review is essential to open access journals no less than to traditional subscription journals both to ensure that the submitted work is within the journal’s scope but also to carefully critique the work before publication. We should not forget that published biomedical information influences clinical practice and thus affects the health of patients. An analogy may be found in the potential dangers for patients if physicians were to make clinical decisions based on results reported in conference abstracts,8 given that major differences often exist between data presented in abstracts and subsequent corresponding full text articles published after peer review, revision and editing.9 The scientific community should have an unconditional, clear and strong interest in preventing false or over-interpreted scientific information from being disseminated, and this commitment requires a rigorous peer review process.

Open access publications should be at the forefront in experimenting with strategies to foster what might be called an increasingly open science. As the open access movement blossoms, its supporters should continue to critically evaluate the parallel development of openness and transparency in the peer review process. We need to ensure that a commitment to high-quality peer review is maintained. At the same time, it has become clear that some aspects of conventional review processes are ineffective. For example, masking the identity of authors to peer reviewers (blind evaluation) was hypothesized as a way of avoiding conflicts of interest on the part of reviewers, but it has been shown that blinding cannot be always be maintained in either journal manuscripts or conference abstracts.10,11 Open access journals are in an ideal position to test the merits of open, unblinded, peer review.

Other aspect of openness in peer review also merit exploration. Most manuscripts are rejected on at least their initial submission for publication (especially at the leading biomedical journals). A considerable proportion of these manuscripts are submitted for publication in other journals, usually with lower rejection rates. Of 350 manuscripts rejected by the Annals of Internal Medicine during 1993 and 1994, 69% were subsequently published in other journals with an average time from rejection of the initial submission to its publication in another journal of 18 months.12 Similar findings are evidenced by law review journals, which permit and encourage multiple submissions and have shorter manuscript handling times than economics, finance, mathematics and psychology journals, which do not allow multiple submissions.13 Such publication delays have led to suggestions that simultaneous submission of an article to two or more journals might reduce the time from initial submission to publication.13 In addition to reducing delays caused by the requirement for sequential submission, simultaneous submissions may increase healthy competition between journals to reduce their editorial response time.

A natural extension of this “open” submission process would be to make peer reviews of rejected manuscripts available for consideration during subsequent submissions to other journals. Although this practice is recommended by some journals in their instructions to authors, authors rarely adhere to it — for obvious reasons. However, this practice would expedite editorial decisions; for example, it would show whether the authors had addressed previous critiques and thus inform a decision as to whether their work warrants further external peer review. Authors might be more motivated under this system to improve a manuscript after its rejection by paying attention to the suggestions of peer reviewers before submission to another journal, and editors would be able to see where significant improvements to the manuscript have been made.

In conclusion, we know that the peer review process is not without flaws. The birth of the open access publication model and the rise of a more open science presents an ideal opportunity to re-evaluate the transparency of editorial and peer review practices. I believe that when, and if, the scientific community fully adopts policies leading to open access to journal content and the open peer evaluation of manuscripts (e.g., by signing peer reviews and publishing reviews online), the level of transparency and quality in scientific publishing of research data will be further boosted. This will substantially contribute to the advancement of science and to the international community that scientists serve.",2688088418,Matthew E Falagas

However, the policy interventions available to resolve these problems have different levels of supporting scientific evidence. Decision-makers, who are not necessarily scientifically trained, may favour policies with limited scientific backing to obtain public support. We illustrate these tensions with two case studies where the scientific consensus went up against the governing parties’ chosen policy. What mechanisms exist to keep the weight of scientific evidence at the forefront of decision-making at the highest levels of government? In this paper, we propose that Canada create “Departmental Chief Science Advisors” (DCSAs), based on a program in the UK, to help complement and extend the reach of the newly created Chief Science Advisor position.

Alessandro Delfanti, University of California, Davis Nico Pitrelli, International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) Open science: revolution or continuity? Will scientific discovery become as quick and immediate as a tweet? For Michael Nielsen, quantum computing expert and open science advocate, we are in the middle of a transition towards a new scientific era, an era comparable to the 17th century Scientific Revolution and the transition to the modern age. According to Nielsen’s book Reinventing Discovery, thanks to the Internet we have a chance to radically transform the way in which knowledge is produced (2012). The US scientist highlights two directions in which networks have impacted science: an acceleration in the speed of scientific discovery, and a profound change within science and society relationships. This increased epistemic and social efficiency is based on the impact of openness on the scientific enterprise. “Open science” is a very broad concept that encompasses several different practices and tools linked to the use of collaborative digital technologies and alternative intellectual property tools. Some inclusive definitions propose that open science embraces practices as different as open access to scientific literature, digitally-mediated forms of open collaboration, as well as the use of copyleft licenses to foster reuse of scientific results and protocols. For example, FOSTER, a project recently funded by the European Commission to set in place sustainable mechanisms for EU researchers to embrace open science practices, defines open science as “the conduction of science in a way that others can collaborate and contribute, where research data, lab notes and other research processes are freely available, with terms that allow reuse, redistribution and reproduction of the research.” 1 The taxonomy tree of this concept branches into several directions (see also Fecher and Friesike 2014). The website lists at least five different classes of issues or topics related to open science: Open Access, Open Data, Open Reproducible Research, Open Science Evaluation, and Open Science Policies. Each of these themes can be subdivided in many other subtopics that represent the whole spectrum of difficulties you face in an open science framework. Not to consider Research Data Management, and finally Ethics and Legal Issues. This complexity might partially explain why, in spite of Internet apologists’ emphatic tones, some scientists seem to be reluctant in the adoption of the opportunities networks offer. Twenty years after the birth of the World Wide Web at CERN, in Geneva, scientific research is embracing change at a slower pace than other fields of cultural production. For example, physics might seem to be one of the disciplines that have taken the most advantage of the opportunities offered by digital and connective technologies: since the dawn of the modern Internet physicists have inaugurated preprint archives in which any researcher can deposit and make freely available the draft versions of scientific articles before submitting them to an academic journal. Yet in recent initiatives in the field of physics that deploy huge organizational and financial efforts, as well as strong promises of https://www.fosteropenscience.eu/foster-taxonomy/open-science-definition, accessed January 19, 2015",620826715; 1224873507,Alessandro Delfanti; Nico Pitrelli

Set against the context of Open Science, the presentation underlines the need for a mandatory Exception for Text and Data Mining (TDM), which cannot be overridden by contract. The Hague Declaration underlines that research data was never meant to be obstructed by copyright restrictions. For legal certainty, however, and to enable TDM activity on commercially-produced publications, an Exception is urgently needed to allow TDM for at least education and research. The right to read is the right to mine, and users should ideally be able to undertake TDM on all those materials to which they have legal access.",2690878751,P Ayris

impact on how researchers communicate their findings. On this basis, this paper proposes a conceptual
model of scientific communication inspired by the concepts of Open Science. It shows that the practices
