Methods: The investigation was performed for PTW30013 (20 chambers), 30001 (10 chambers), FC65-G (17 chambers) cylindrical chambers and for PPC05 (14 chambers), Roos 34001 (8 chambers) plane parallel chambers. The calibration factors were measured at the same accredited secondary standard laboratory in terms of a dose to water. All the measurements were carried out at the same laboratory, by the same staff, in accordance with the same IAEA recommendations. All the chambers were calibrated in the Co60 beam. Reproducibility was described in terms of the mean value, its standard deviation and the ratio of the maximum and minimum value of calibration factors for each set of chambers separately. The combined uncertainty budged (1SD) calculated according to the IAEA-TECDOC-1585 of the calibration factor was of 0.25%. Results: The calibration coefficients for PTW30013, 30001, and FC65-G chambers were 5.36±0.03, 5.28±0.06, 4.79±0.015 nC/Gy respectively and for PPC05, and Roos chambers were 59±2, 8.3±0.1 nC/Gy respectively. The maximum/minimum ratio of calibration factors for PTW30013, 30001, FC65-G, and for PPC05, Roos chambers were 1.03, 1.03, 1.01, 1.14 and 1.03 respectively. Conclusion: The production of all ion chambers was very reproducible except the Markus type PPC05 for which the ratio of maximum/minimum calibration coefficients of 1.14 was obtained.","",""

Materials and Methods Three-dimensional soft tissue facial landmarks were obtained from the faces of 10 adult subjects, by use of a 3D stereophotogrammetric imaging system (Vectra; Canfield Scientific, Fairfield, NJ). Sixteen linear measurements were computed. Systematic and random errors between operators, calibration steps, and acquisitions were calculated. Results No systematic errors were found for all performed tests ( P > .05, paired t test). The method was repeatable, and random errors were always lower than 1 mm, except for the distance from cheilion to cheilion. Repeated sets of acquisition showed random errors up to 0.91 mm, without systematic biases.

This problem could be related to a lack of readability when using conventional X-rays. Hypothesis Computed tomography scanning (CT scan) will improve the interobserver reproducibility of the AO classification for trochanteric fractures. Patients and methods This was a prospective, observational, descriptive study following a group of 53 patients with trochanteric fractures. The fractures were evaluated with conventional X-rays, CT scan slices and 3D reconstruction (3DR). The resulting images were blinded and analysed by two observers using two classification systems: AO and Evans modified by Jensen (EVJE). A sample size of 53 was needed to show an improvement in the interobserver reproducibility when deciding the AO classification type with CT scan images. Kappa coefficients were used to measure interobserver reproducibility and agreement; agreement is the degree of consistency in the analysis by one observer who views the same fracture on two different imaging modalities. Results The interobserver reproducibility for the AO classification was 0.28 for X-rays, 0.33 for CT scan and 0.28 for 3DR. For the EVJE classification, these coefficients were 0.50 for X-rays, 0.35 for CT scan and 0.47 for 3DR. The agreement rate between the two imaging modalities was between 0.38 and 0.58 for X-rays/CT scan and between 0.79 and 0.86 for CT scan/3DR. Discussion The primary objective of this study was not achieved. CT imaging does not improve the interobserver reproducibility of various classification systems for trochanteric fractures. However, by providing images as slices, the complex nature of fractures in this area was revealed. The challenges related to classifying various fractures are not exclusively related to a “readability” problem, but also an understanding and analysis problem.

Acknowledging this elicits the key questions: where are we? Where are we headed? What, if anything, can be done about this? And what can the “economics of science” contribute to this? This paper assumes a “cultural political economy of research & innovation” (CPERI) perspective to explore the current upheaval and transition in the system of academic knowledge production, at the confluence of accelerating commercialisation and the seemingly opposing movement of “open science.” This perspective affords a characterisation of the core of the current crises as a crisis of moral economy; an issue to which a political economy of epistemic authority is in turn crucial. A “remoralizing” of knowledge production is thus a matter of key systemic importance, though it is important to understand such developments in power-strategic, and not explicitly moral, terms. Much of the current moves towards “open science” and “massively open online courses” (MOOCs) can also then be seen as self-defeating developments that simply exacerbate the crisis of a viable “economy of science” and in no sense its solution. Their lasting significance, however, is more likely to lie precisely in their effects on the construction of a new moral economy of knowledge production.","",""

To develop a fast protocol for measuring T1 values in the internal carotid artery (ICA), to validate this technique with in vitro measurements, and to evaluate its reproducibility.

Methods
A modified Look–Locker sequence was optimized to enable rapid determination of T1 in the ICA at 3T. T1 values from the ICA were compared with in vitro measurements on individually sampled venous blood oxygenated to arterial levels. A test–retest reproducibility study was also conducted.

Results
The group-averaged arterial blood T1 value was 1908 ± 77 ms for six women (hematocrit = 0.39 ± 0.03) and 1785 ± 55 ms for seven men (hematocrit = 0.45 ± 0.02), which is 100–200 ms longer than the widely adopted value obtained from bovine blood experiments. The arterial T1 value per subject correlated significantly with individual hematocrit values. The intrasession and intersession coefficients of variation were 1.1% and 2.1%, respectively, indicating good precision and reproducibility of our method. Reasonable agreement was observed between the in vivo and in vitro results with a correlation coefficient of 0.78.

Conclusion
The proposed method can provide fast arterial T1 measurement on individual subjects. When not performing such a subject-specific measurement, we recommend the use of 1908 ms and 1785 ms for healthy women and men, respectively, or 1841 ms for adults in general.

The case example in this article examined a reproducibility issue pertaining to the use of administrative data systems for evaluation of child maltreatment (CM) prevention, making use of a prevention study conducted over a decade ago that provided a unique opportunity. The place-randomization study, which randomized counties to condition, found that community-wide implementation of a parenting and family support intervention produced positive impact on county-wide rates for substantiated CM cases and out-of-home placements, documented through a state information system. The key consideration is whether and to what extent the administrative record data re-examined retroactively a decade later for the original study’s time period would yield comparable results to those based on data acquired at the time of the study. The results indicated that despite small changes over time, the same data patterns and statistical effects were reproducible for the two archival outcome variables. For substantiated CM, the reproduced analyses reflected higher effect sizes and a clear pattern of reduction as a function of intervention. For out-of-home placements, effect sizes were quite comparable to the original ones, reflecting preventive impact. Overall, this case study illustrated the verifiability of data reproducibility in the context of a population outcome evaluation, which underscores the importance of reliable population-prevalence measurement as an essential part of a comprehensive public health strategy aimed at the prevention of CM.",WOS:000393444400002,CHILD ABUSE & NEGLECT

Quantitative longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S) is used to assess progress of brain disorders and treatment effects. Understanding the significance of MRI/S changes requires knowledge of the inherent technical and physiological consistency of these measurements. This longitudinal study examined the variance and reproducibility of commonly used quantitative MRI/S measurements in healthy subjects while controlling physiological and technical parameters.

Methods
Twenty-five subjects were imaged three times over 5 days on a Siemens 3T Verio scanner equipped with a 32-channel phase array coil. Structural (T1, T2-weighted, and diffusion-weighted imaging) and physiological (pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy) data were collected. Consistency of repeated images was evaluated with mean relative difference, mean coefficient of variation, and intraclass correlation (ICC). Finally, a “reproducibility rating” was calculated based on the number of subjects needed for a 3% and 10% difference.

Results
Structural measurements generally demonstrated excellent reproducibility (ICCs 0.872–0.998) with a few exceptions. Moderate-to-low reproducibility was observed for fractional anisotropy measurements in fornix and corticospinal tracts, for cortical gray matter thickness in the entorhinal, insula, and medial orbitofrontal regions, and for the count of the periependymal hyperintensive white matter regions. The reproducibility of physiological measurements ranged from excellent for most of the magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements to moderate for permeability-diffusivity coefficients in cingulate gray matter to low for regional blood flow in gray and white matter.

Discussion
This study demonstrates a high degree of longitudinal consistency across structural and physiological measurements in healthy subjects, defining the inherent variability in these commonly used sequences. Additionally, this study identifies those areas where caution should be exercised in interpretation. Understanding this variability can serve as the basis for interpretation of MRI/S data in the assessment of neurological disorders and treatment effects.",WOS:000411368500006,BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR

Levels of test-retest reliability and concurrent validity were expressed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), agreement with standard errors of measurement (SEM). For SF, test-retest reliability (ICC's > 0.75) and agreement of the Myotest were considered as good at all running speeds. For GCT, test-retest reliability was found to be moderate at a running speed of 14 km/h and poor at speeds of 10 and 12 km/h (ICC 0.75) and moderate for GCT (0.50 < ICC's < 0.75).

Both for facade sound insulation and reverberation time the main variations in the one-third octave bands were found in the low frequencies range. The study was also focused on the evaluation of single number quantities (SNQs) and their uncertainties. Single number quantities were evaluated in both narrow (from 100 to 3150 Hz) and extended (from 50 to 5000 Hz) range. Concerning the SNQs and their uncertainties, no significant differences were observed whether the low frequencies were included or not, unlike the case of airborne sound insulation (investigated in the first part of this study). The uncertainty results were compared with the relevant standards and with literature results. Based on these comparisons, it was highlighted that the standard deviation of reproducibility of facade elements is not adequately reflected in the ISO 12999-1 and further research is needed to specify the in situ standard deviation of reproducibility for facade elements.",WOS:000355033900004,APPLIED ACOUSTICS

To establish operator-independent, fully automated planning of standard cardiac geometries and to determine the impact on interstudy reproducibility of cardiac functional parameters.



Materials and Methods:

Cardiac MR imaging was done in 50 patients referred for left-ventricular function assessment. In all patients, first standard manual planning was performed followed by automatic planning (AUTO1) and repeat automatic planning (AUTO2) after repositioning the patient to investigate interstudy reproducibility. Cardiac functional parameters were assessed and cine scans were visually graded on a 4-point scale from nondiagnostic to excellent.



Results:

Overall success rate of AUTO was 94% with good to excellent geometry planning in >94% of cine standard views. Comparing manual versus fully automated planning, a high agreement of cardiac functional parameters (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, 0.91 to 0.99) with minimal percent bias (0.24 to 3.84%) was found. In addition, a high interstudy reproducibility of automatic planning was demonstrated (Lin's concordance correlation coefficient, 0.89 to 0.99; percent bias, 0.38 to 5.04%; precision, 3.46 to 9.09%).



Conclusion:

Fully automated planning of cardiac geometries could reliably be performed in patients showing a variety of cardiovascular pathologies. Standard cardiac geometries were precisely replicated and functional parameters were highly accurate. J. Magn. Reson.

A relevant parameter to assess brain oxygenation may be the cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (StO2) measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). So far the reproducibility of StO2 measurements was too low for clinical application, probably due to inhomogeneities. The aim of this study was to test a novel sensor geometry which reduces the influence of inhomogeneities. Thirty clinically stable newborn infants, with a gestational age of median 33.9 (range 26.9 to 41.9) weeks, birth weight of 2220 (820 to 4230) g, postnatal age of 5 (1 to 71) days were studied. At least four StO2 measurements of 1 min duration were carried out using NIRS on the lateral head. The sensor was repositioned between measurements. Reproducibility was calculated by a linear mixed effects model. The mean StO2 was 79.99 ± 4.47% with a reproducibility of 2.76% and a between-infant variability of 4.20%. Thus, the error of measurement only accounts for 30.1% of the variability. The novel sensor geometry leads to considerably more precise measurements compared to previous studies with, e.g., ∼5% reproducibility for the NIRO 300. The novel StO2 values hence have a higher clinical relevance. C 2011 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).",WOS:000296707100035,JOURNAL OF BIOMEDICAL OPTICS

Both services, and their sponsoring organizations, the California Digital Library (CDL) and the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), have succeeded in enabling researchers to comply with funder requirements in producing DMPs. However, this is just one step along the road to advancing open science.We see an opportunity to further leverage DMPs to support open science by integrating them into the broader ecosystem of data management infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal, we must redefine success to include not just adoption of our services by institutions but also widespread adoption by individual researchers, disciplinary communities, and funders. Working together with all stakeholders to make DMPs an essential, open part of the research lifecycle, and not just a matter of compliance, is the next step toward effectively managing and sharing research data.We propose to join forces and build a new, global data management advisory platform that links DMPs to other components of the research lifecycle. The biomedical research community provides an opportunity to adapt the infrastructure and associated educational resources to one specific disciplinary community and plug into new initiatives. We will reposition DMPs as living documents useful for structuring the course of biomedical research activities and integrating with related data management systems to lower the barriers for implementation and promote culture change. Consolidating around a single platform for DMPs extends our reach, keeps costs down, and moves best practices forward, allowing us to participate in a truly global open science ecosystem.","",""

Computational neuroscience is a rapidly developing field, where reproducibility and comparability of research results have gained increasing interest over the past years. As the number of computational models of brain functions is increasing, we chose to address reproducibility using four previously published computational models of astrocyte excitability as an example. Although not conventionally taken into account when modeling neuronal systems, astrocytes have been shown to take part in a variety of in vitro and in vivo phenomena including synaptic transmission. Two of the selected astrocyte models describe spontaneous calcium excitability, and the other two neurotransmitter-evoked calcium excitability. We specifically addressed how well the original simulation results can be reproduced with a reimplementation of the models. Additionally, we studied how well the selected models can be reused and whether they are comparable in other stimulation conditions and research settings. Unexpectedly, we found out that three of the model publications did not give all the necessary information required to reimplement the models. In addition, we were able to reproduce the original results of only one of the models completely based on the information given in the original publications and in the errata. We actually found errors in the equations provided by two of the model publications; after modifying the equations accordingly, the original results were reproduced more accurately. Even though the selected models were developed to describe the same biological event, namely astrocyte calcium excitability, the models behaved quite differently compared to one another. Our findings on a specific set of published astrocyte models stress the importance of proper validation of the models against experimental wet-lab data from astrocytes as well as the careful review process of models. A variety of aspects of model development could be improved, including the presentation of models in publications and databases. Specifically, all necessary mathematical equations, as well as parameter values, initial values of variables, and stimuli used should be given precisely for successful reproduction of scientific results.",WOS:000394455100001,FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS

To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of subfoveal choroidal thickness (CT) calculations performed manually using optical coherence tomography (OCT). Methods. The CT was imaged in vivo at each of two visits on 11 healthy volunteers (mean age, 35.72 ± 13.19 years) using the spectral domain OCT. CT was manually measured after applying ImageJ processing filters on 15 radial subfoveal scans. Each radial scan was spaced 12° from each other and contained 2500 A-scans. The coefficient of variability, coefficient of repeatability (CoR), coefficient of reproducibility, and intraclass correlation coefficient determined the reproducibility and repeatability of the calculation. Axial length (AL) and mean spherical equivalent refractive error were measured with the IOLMaster and an open view autorefractor to study their potential relationship with CT. Results. The within-visit and between-visit coefficient of variability, CoR, coefficient of reproducibility, and intraclass correlation coefficient were 0.80, 2.97% 2.44%, and 99%, respectively. The subfoveal CT correlated significantly with AL (R = -0.60, p = 0.05). Conclusions. The subfoveal CT could be measured manually in vivo using OCT and the readings obtained from the healthy subjects evaluated were repeatable and reproducible. It is proposed that OCT could be a useful instrument to perform in vivo assessment and monitoring of CT changes in retinal disease. The preliminary results suggest a negative correlation between subfoveal CT and AL in such a way that it decreases with increasing AL but not with refractive error.","",""

Many scientific workflows have intensive resource requirements. Therefore, different distributed platforms, including campus clusters, grids and clouds are used for efficient execution of these workflows. In this paper we examine the performance and the cost of running the Pegasus Workflow Management System (Pegasus WMS) implementation of blast2cap3, the protein-guided assembly approach, on three different execution platforms: Sandhills, the University of Nebraska Campus Cluster, the academic grid Open Science Gird (OSG), and the commercial cloud Amazon EC2. Furthermore, the behavior of the blast2cap3 workflow was tested with different number of tasks. For the used workflows and execution platforms, we perform multiple runs in order to compare the total workflow running time, as well as the different resource availability over time. Additionally, for the most interesting runs, the number of running versus the number of idle jobs over time was analyzed for each platform. The performed experiments show that using the Pegasus WMS implementation of blast2cap3 with more than 100 tasks significantly reduces the running time for all execution platforms. In general, for our workflow, better performance and resource usage were achieved when Amazon EC2 was used as an execution platform. However, due to the Amazon EC2 cost, the academic distributed systems can sometimes be a good alternative and have excellent performance, especially when there are plenty of resources available.","",""

To compare repeatability and reproducibility of four different methods of apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) evaluation of liver parenchyma. In fact, repeatability and reproducibility assessment is mandatory in quantitative evaluations, however, these have not been accurately investigated in liver MR-diffusion-weighted studies.

Materials and Methods:
Diffusion-weighted sequences, b-value = 0–1000 s/mm2, were acquired on 30 healthy volunteers by a 1.5T scanner whose reliability has been validated by a phantom study. Four sampling methods, evaluating various parenchyma percentages by different-sized region-of-interests (ROIs), were compared by two observers: 70% and 30% of the volume, 4%-one-ROI-per-segment, and 4%-one-ROI-per-slice in the right-lobe. Ninety-five percent limits of agreement and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated.

Results:
Complete measurements on the left lobe could be obtained in less than half of patients. The 4%-one-ROI-per-slice and 4%-one-ROI-per-segment yielded lower mean values compared with 30–70% volume methods (1343–1373 versus 1463–1560·10−6 mm2/s, respectively). Repeatability was acceptable (ICCs ∼ 0.80) whereas reproducibility was low (ICCs ≤ 0.45) for all methods. Averaging at least 3 measurements in middle-lower sections of the right lobe improved both repeatability (ICCs to ≥0.87) and reproducibility (ICCs to 0.82) for 30–70% V methods.

Conclusion:
ADC measurements were repeatable but not reproducible in our study. Reproducibility could be improved by taking averages on the right lobe with large ROI methods. Studies on procedures that standardize ADC measurements using more than two observers are needed. J. Magn. Reson.

Checking the reliability of this type of data is relevant, mostly in situations where, as a rapid method, it is obtained from consumers and in less controlled conditions such as online studies. While an excellent performance is expected and required from trained subjects, when working with consumers it is convenient to explore the data obtained, since this can also hint at how seriously they are taking the task, their levels of fatigue, boredom, etc. In this work, we have developed some complementary tools to existing ones to be able to evaluate statistically the reproducibility of both the respondents and the panel. The assessment of the reliability of the panel would not be complete without other methodologies dedicated to the reproducibility at the panel level of the products and of the terms, and to the assessment of the agreements between pairs of respondents, and between each respondent and the panel solution. For those criteria, methodologies based on multiple factor analysis on contingency tables and McNemar test are presented. To illustrate the methodology developed, the statistical complements were applied on data from two studies. The studies, one involving emotions and another one sensory characterisation data, were conducted in two different test–retest sessions.

In the Open Science Grid (OSG), privileges are granted on the basis of the user's membership to a Virtual Organization (VO). However, user privilege definitions and enforcements are administered separately by VOs and Grid sites. Such partitioning can potentially introduce inconsistent user privileges throughout the Grid and break the Grid paradigm of uniform access to resources. There is a need for an automated privilege management mechanism for a VO to codify privilege policies granted to its users, to propagate the policies to grid sites, to identity and suggest remedies for non-supported VO privileges at individual sites. The Scalable Virtual Organization Privileges Management Environment (SVOPME) addresses the challenge under the context of the Open Science Grid (OSG). The SVOPME provides tools for VOs to define and publish desired privileges. At a site, SVOPME tools help analyze access policies defined for VO users and verify policy consistency between VOs and sites, and suggest site configurations changes. This paper presents the designs and features of SVOPME tools and the lessons learned in applying SVOPME tools for OSG VOs and sites. Furthermore, we will outline future improvements to SVOPME tools to adapt to a range of different site configurations and new privilege policies.",WOS:000395208200015,MANAGED GRIDS AND CLOUD SYSTEMS IN THE ASIA-PACIFIC RESEARCH COMMUNITY

In addition, the influence of the observer’s experience on the repeatability of landmark setting was also explored.

Twenty patients without any craniofacial deformity (11 females and 9 males; age range 6.1–16 years) were selected retrospectively from CT volume data sets already available from 695 patients of Dental Clinic 3, Orthodontics of Erlangen University Hospital. The CT examination was performed with the SOMATOM Sensation®64 (Siemens AG Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The program VoXim®6.1 (IVS Solutions AG, Chemnitz, Germany) was used for 3D reconstruction of the volume data sets. A total of 28 landmarks were examined in the skeleton module of the program VoXim®6.1. The randomly sorted data sets were analysed by two orthodontists and two postgraduate students. Each data set was analysed twice by each observer at an interval of 3 weeks. The analysis of variance regarding random effects was used to calculate the intraobserver and interobserver components of standard deviation (SD) of depiction of individual landmarks as measures of repeatability and reproducibility, respectively. Median intraserial SD and interserial SD of 0.46 mm (range: 0.14–2.00 mm) and 0.20 mm (range: 0.02–2.47 mm), respectively, were obtained depending on the landmark and plane. This study included systematic analysis of extreme values (outliers) in the assessment of the quality of measurements obtained.

Descriptive statistics revealed qualitative differences in the depiction of different landmarks. The landmarks nasion and infradentale revealed a minor SD in all three spatial coordinates with the smallest SD for infradentale (SD = 0.18 mm) in the transverse plane. However, no systematic trend was identified with regard to the influence of the observer’s level of experience affecting the repeatability of landmark positioning. Thus, the repeatability and reproducibility of placements of landmarks with 3D CT were found to be acceptable for a majority of anatomical positions.",WOS:000304542800002,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS

Setting Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China. Design Observational cross-sectional study. Methods Eyes from healthy subjects and eyes from patients with cataracts were examined with the new interferometer. Axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), keratometry (K), and white-to-white (WTW) values were measured by 2 operators. The test–retest repeatability, coefficient of variation (CoV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated to evaluate intraoperator repeatability. Different-operator comparison was analyzed with paired t tests and Bland-Altman plots to assess interoperator reproducibility. Results Ninety-eight people were enrolled for this study, of which 52 eyes were from healthy subjects and 46 eyes were from patients with cataracts. The AL was the most repeatable and reproducible parameter. The ACD, K values, and WTW measurements were highly repeatable in healthy subjects with CoV less than 0.89% and ICC more than 0.94. However, in patients with cataracts, high repeatability could only be observed for AL, ACD, and K values, whereas WTW measurement had test–retest repeatability of 0.80 mm and an ICC of 0.795. Bland-Altman analysis also showed good agreement between the 2 operators for ocular component measurements, except that the WTW in patients with cataracts had wider 95% limits of agreement (range −0.88 to 0.95 mm). Conclusion The new biometer showed excellent intraoperator repeatability and interoperator reproducibility for AL, ACD, and K values measurements in both groups. The precision of WTW measurements was lower in patients with cataracts.

Money back guarantees are generally unheard of in biomedicine and healthcare. Recently, the US provider Geisenger Health System, in Pennsylvania, started a programme to give patients their money back if they were dissatisfied.1 That came as quite a surprise. Soon thereafter, the chief medical officer at Merck launched an even bigger one, proposing an “incentive-based approach” to non-reproducible results—what he termed a “reproducibility crisis” that “threatens the entire biomedical research enterprise.”2

The problem of irreproducibility in biomedical research is real and has been emphasised in multiple reports.3 4 5 In the same vein, the retraction of academic papers has been rising, attributable, in nearly equal parts, to irreproducible results or data that have been falsified.6

But this problem is not confined to basic science or animal model work from academic laboratories. Clinical trials, the final common pathway for the validation and approval of new drugs, have been plagued with serious drawbacks.

Reproducibility problems appear in various cases; in different systems and the different ESD guns, even if the ESD test conducted using the same systems and ESD guns. This paper is proposed the method which can improve the reproducibility of the system-level ESD test at the same system. The operating state of DRAM is very important factor to the ESD failure level by measuring the signals of memory modules during an ESD event. The soft failure is observed when there is a signal toggling during an ESD event. Through the experiment of program workload, it is confirmed there is a strong correlation between the program workload and the reproducibility of ESD test result. The reproducibility of the system-level ESD test can be improved by maximizing the program workload.","",""

Subsequently an analysis of bibliometric and altmetric indicators at the author and publication level was carried out, based on the results of searches on eight scientific platforms (Google Scholar, ResearchGate, Academia.edu, Mendeley, ORCID, IraLIS, E-LIS and EXIT), three social networks (Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn), and data provided by a commercial supplier (Altmetric.com). Overall we found a greater presence of authors in ResearchGate (58%), Academia.edu (51%) and Google Scholar (49%) as opposed to Mendeley (25%) and ORCID (18%). Furthermore, as to social platforms, the greatest potential influence lies with Facebook, due to its high number of followers ( / top 10 authors). In addition, an analysis with the Spearman rho statistic, shows among some sources and platforms, a low correlation between the number of citations in Google Scholar and readings in Mendeley (r = 382) and low negative for mentions in blogs (r = 0,-237), Google+ (r = 0, -214) and Twitter (r = 0, -183).

Driven by the impetus of the Open Science movement, some researchers have put their laboratory notebook online, providing access to this occluded and largely unexplored research genre. Drawing on the notion of the adaptability of language, this paper proposes a case-study of an online genomics notebook from two perspectives, inter-generic and intra-generic. We first investigate the considerable adaptation that takes place when the record of experimental work in the notebook is shaped into a public research claim in the downstream research article genre, focusing on utterer-interpreter relations and the immediacy of the notebook vs the decontextualized reconstruction of the article. We then investigate how migration to the web also results in adaptation by comparing the online notebook with the traditional paper notebooks used in science labs. The comparison shows that the online version places more emphasis on emotive elements and that its language and presentational features are more informal. We conclude with some comments on the metapragmatic awareness of the author of the online notebook as he navigates between these different genres and media.",WOS:000404699100006,JOURNAL OF PRAGMATICS

The project synopsis put together by Nosek and Errington (1) tried to describe carefully what replication means, how to judge whether “same” (or different) results emerge in a replication experiment, and how to interpret divergent results in original vs reproducibility studies. However, multiple other commentators on these first reproducibility studies have enhanced our uncertainty. Almost every commentator reached a somewhat different conclusion. Reproducibility of inferences has been dismal.

Several authors of the original papers along with other commentators have questioned the reproducibility effort. These retorts typically defend the original findings, interpreting the replications as more successful than unsuccessful. They question replications on multiple fronts, e.g., inappropriate statistical methods or poor experimental competence. They lament the inappropriate shaming consequences, when poorly done replication efforts tarnish great scientists. They worry that reproducibility checks destroy discovery and stall efforts to translate promising research. They wonder whether we should waste money on replication.

The reproducibility wars are not exclusive to laboratory science. Last year, a similar debate erupted with a Technical Comment exchange on the respective reproducibility project on psychology (2), although the available data were far more extensive (100 experiments instead of just 5 preliminary ones) and had a massive participation of top psychologists (270 scientists and their teams) trying to reproduce results. Some famous psychology academics nevertheless concluded that their field had no reproducibility problem and reproducibility was misleading business. This position is immediately suspect. If psychological science is so perfect, how can it be that 270 of the best psychologists in the world working under optimal conditions of openness and most rigorous protocols and methods could get everything so badly wrong?

Abstract

Background:  A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) is the most commonly used method in large epidemiological studies. The validation of an FFQ is essential for specific populations because foods are culture-dependent. The present study aimed to develop an FFQ and evaluate its validity and reproducibility in estimating the intake of nutrients in urban and rural areas of Poland.



Methods:  Adult participants (n = 146) in the Polish arm of the ongoing Prospective Urban and Rural Epidemiological (PURE) study completed FFQs on two occasions, as well as four 24-h dietary recalls (DRs) during a 12-month period. Correlation coefficients (r) and de-attenuated correlation coefficients between dietary recalls and both FFQs were calculated for selected macro- and micronutrients. Agreement between the two methods was evaluated by classification into quartiles and the Bland–Altman method. Reproducibility was assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).



Results:  The final food list contained 134 food items. For urban participants, FFQ2 generally underestimated energy, protein and fat compared to the FFQ1 and mean of DRs. In rural areas, compared to DRs, both FFQs overestimated energy and macronutrients. For both urban and rural settings, de-attenuated correlation exceeded 0.4 for almost all nutrients and the exact agreement in quartile categorisation was >66%. When assessing repeatability, ICC varied from 0.39–0.63 in an urban setting and 0.19–0.45 in a rural setting.



Conclusions:  This 134-item FFQ has good validity and reproducibility in relation to the reference method and can be used to rank individuals based on their macro- and micronutrient intake.",WOS:000303993300005,JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS

We consider a model with efficient bargaining ex ante in which firms do not compete in the final market. Assuming that the complementary innovations constitute a common input and that agents make complementary investments in its private exploitation, we find that, when complementarities are sufficiently strong, a commitment to openness may provide greater incentives than an exclusion regime. The theoretical framework may be applied to interpret Open Source Software licenses, intellectual property rights licensing arrangements within research joint ventures and royalty stacking issues.

Therefore, there has been recent interest in developing noninvasive imaging tools for cancer assessment that are sensitive to changes in tissue mechanical properties. We have developed one such method, modality independent elastography (MIE), that estimates the relative elastic properties of tissue by fitting anatomical image volumes acquired before and after the application of compression to biomechanical models. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy and reproducibility of the method using phantoms and a murine breast cancer model. Magnetic resonance imaging data were acquired, and the MIE method was used to estimate relative volumetric stiffness. Accuracy was assessed using phantom data by comparing to gold-standard mechanical testing of elasticity ratios. Validation error was 12% . Reproducibility analysis was performed on animal data, and within-subject coefficients of variation ranged from 2 to 13% at the bulk level and 32% at the voxel level. To our knowledge, this is the first study to assess the reproducibility of an elasticity imaging metric in a preclinical cancer model. Our results suggest that the MIE method can reproducibly generate accurate estimates of the relative mechanical stiffness and provide guidance on the degree of change needed in order to declare biological changes rather than experimental error in future therapeutic studies.",WOS:000374234800011,JOURNAL OF MEDICAL IMAGING

This framework is currently being used on several campuses to run HEP and other science jobs. Further, the framework has in some cases been expanded beyond the campus boundary by bridging campus grids into a regional grid, and can even be used to integrate resources from a national cyberinfrastructure such as the Open Science Grid.

Of the 49 patients scanned, the intercenter reproducibility for T2* was 5.9% for the heart and 5.8% for the liver. Local interstudy reproducibility for T2* was 7.4% for the heart and 4.6% for the liver. Interobserver reproducibility for T2* was 5.4% for the heart and 4.4% for the liver.



Conclusion:

These data indicate that T2* MR may be developed into a widespread test for tissue siderosis providing that well-defined and approved imaging and analysis techniques are used. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2010;32:315–319. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",WOS:000280447300008,JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING

I reflect on the distinctive treatment of both realism and explanation

former than the latter. I welcome his critique of the use and misuse of ‘isms’ in much of the 
existing literature, whilst pointing to some potential inconsistencies; I accept his broad and 
inclusive understanding of philosophic realism; and I pr
aise Dowding for putting the question of 
explanation 
–
and its adequacy 
–
at the heart of the philosophy of political science (where I think 
it belongs). Yet I reject the idea that prediction is or, indeed, should be central to all social

by questions of causation, suggesting that the presentation of a ‘credibly causal’ narrative is the 
crux of adjudicating good from bad explanation. I explore the implicat

Adventures and (re)routings on the way to full Open Access,0,"Watch the VIDEO here. Since the “Amsterdam Call for Action on Open Science” was published in April 2016, there is supposed to be “a clear panEuropean target: from 2020 all new publications are available through open access from the date of publication”. This call falls into a line of events, in which demands for a more rapid or even radical transition towards full Open Access world experienced a considerable accumulation. With the “OA2020” initiative launched shortly before and the conclusions on the transition towards an Open Science system adopted by the Council of the European Union in late spring of the same year the whirl of excitement seemed to reach its peak. Yet more than a year later a universal consensus on a “one size fits all”-type solution as proposed by a widely debated and promoted white paper of the Max Planck Digital Library has still to prevail. Not only have country or institution-specific case studies which set out for a challenge to quantify potential benefits and disadvantages of such a scenario for themselves delivered mixed results and propositions. Some of the “most eminent” research institutions and nations seem to even back track from their initially stringent Gold-only Open Access transition roadmaps. Unsurprisingly, long-standing Open Access advocates and scholars like Stevan Harnad and Jean-Claude Guedon have repeatedly pointed out that Green, Gold and any other new alternative Open Access models should be seen as complementary strategies and encouraged further experimentation with respect to flexibility and adaptation to local circumstances. Thus, this talk will try to address the perceived “either-or” dilemma in many of recent initiatives and to take a closer look at some of their arguments and underlying assumptions. What it is expected to deliver will be a rather more differentiated and colourful picture of current Open Access transitions and visions.","",""

However, no studies have focused on identifying the location of errors on prostheses fabricated with the subtractive method, leading to a lack of standards for reproducibility evaluations. Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the reproducibility of the subtractive method by conducting 3-dimensional assessments of presintered single-tooth zirconia copings for different teeth. Material and methods Acrylic resin tooth molds for the canine (CAN), premolar (PRE), and molar (MOL) were used to prepare stone casts, and copings were designed and fabricated with the subtractive method. The intaglio surfaces of corresponding presintered zirconia copings were scanned with a blue light scanner. Initial scan data were used as a reference for comparisons with subsequent data for the measurement of errors. Nine color-difference maps were created for each of the 3 groups and used to calculate root-mean-square (RMS) error values. One-way analysis of variance and the Tukey honestly significant difference tests were used for statistical evaluations (α=.05). Results MOL copings exhibited the highest RMS error value (9.22 ±1.56 μm), which was significantly different from values for CAN (3.33 ±2.65 μm) and PRE (4.00 ±2.40 μm; P Conclusions The highest reproducibility was observed for the CAN copings. The clinical reproducibility of the subtractive method can be improved by avoiding sharp angles during abutment preparation and careful reproduction of angles during prosthesis fabrication.","",""

To compare left myocardial performance index (MPI) values and reproducibility using different settings and ultrasound equipment in order to standardize optimal machine settings.



Methods

Left MPI was prospectively evaluated by one observer performing conventional Doppler in 62 fetuses (28–36 weeks of gestational age) using different settings (changing sweep speed, gain and wall motion filter (WMF)) and two different ultrasound devices (Siemens Antares, Siemens; Voluson 730 Expert, GE Medical Systems). Intraclass coefficients of agreement (ICCs) were calculated using Bland–Altman analysis.



Results

Using baseline settings on the Siemens, mean (SD) MPI was 0.44 (0.05) with an ICC of 0.81. Decreasing the sweep speed resulted in decreasing average MPI values (0.43) and decreasing ICC (0.61). Lowering gain also influenced average MPI values (0.46) and ICC (0.76). Raising gain resulted in similar MPI values (0.45) with better ICC (0.90) compared with baseline settings. Raising wall motion filter (WMF) provided the best ICC (0.94) compared with the other settings. Changing the ultrasound equipment resulted in an ICC of 0.64. The optimal settings to achieve the highest reproducibility in measurement of MPI were sweep speed 8, gain 60 dB and WMF 281 Hz for Siemens Antares and sweep speed 5, gain −10 dB and WMF 210 Hz for Voluson 730 Expert.



Conclusion

Changing ultrasound settings or equipment may affect the calculation and repeatability of measurement of MPI values. Strict standardization of methods decreases the variability of this parameter for fetal cardiac function assessment. Copyright © 2014 ISUOG.

Participants repeated the trials on three days. By following Analytical Inverse Optimization procedures, the cost functions of finger forces were reconstructed for each day. The cost functions were found to be reproducible over time: application of a cost function Ci to the data of Day j (i≠j) resulted in smaller deviations from the experimental observations than using other commonly used cost functions. Other findings are: (a) the 2nd order coefficients of the cost function showed negative linear relations with finger force magnitudes; (b) the finger forces were distributed on a 2-dimensional plane in the 4-dimensional finger force space for all subjects and all testing sessions; (c) the data agreed well with the principle of superposition, i.e. the action of object prehension can be decoupled into the control of rotational equilibrium and slipping prevention.",WOS:000304600000001,JOURNAL OF MOTOR BEHAVIOR

(One of the rules for writing a PLOS Ten Simple Rules article is to be Phil Bourne [1]. In lieu of that, we hope effusive praise for Phil will suffice.)

Implicit in the guidelines for writing Ten Simple Rules [1] is “know your audience.” We developed our list of rules with researchers in mind: researchers having some knowledge of statistics, possibly with one or more statisticians available in their building, or possibly with a healthy do-it-yourself attitude and a handful of statistical packages on their laptops. We drew on our experience in both collaborative research and teaching, and, it must be said, from our frustration at being asked, more than once, to “take a quick look at my student’s thesis/my grant application/my referee’s report: it needs some input on the stats, but it should be pretty straightforward.”

There are some outstanding resources available that explain many of these concepts clearly and in much more detail than we have been able to do here: among our favorites are Cox and Donnelly [2], Leek [3], Peng [4], Kass et al. [5], Tukey [6], and Yu [7].

Every article on statistics requires at least one caveat. Here is ours: we refer in this article to “science” as a convenient shorthand for investigations using data to study questions of interest. This includes social science, engineering, digital humanities, finance, and so on. Statisticians are not shy about reminding administrators that statistical science has an impact on nearly every part of almost all organizations.",WOS:000379349700037,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

Peaks in the diffusion profile were estimated with the single tensor (ST), Q-ball (QSH) and persistent angular structure (PAS) methods. Segmentation of the OR was performed by two experimenters with probabilistic tractography based on a manually drawn region-of-interest (ROI) protocol typically employed for OR segmentation, with both standard and extended sets of ROIs. The repeatability and reproducibility were assessed by calculating the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of intra- and inter-rater experiments, respectively. ICCs were calculated for commonly used dMRI metrics (FA, MD, AD, RD) and anatomical dimensions of the optic radiation (distance from Meyer's loop to the temporal pole, ML-TP), as well as the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) between the raters’ OR segmentation. Bland–Altman plots were also calculated to investigate bias and variability in the reproducibility measurements.



The OR was successfully reconstructed in all subjects by both raters. The ICC was found to be in the good to excellent range for both repeatability and reproducibility of the dMRI metrics, DSC and ML-TP distance. The Bland–Altman plots did not show any apparent systematic bias for any quantities.



Overall, higher ICC values were found for the multi-fiber methods, QSH and PAS, and for the standard set of ROIs. Considering the good to excellent repeatability and reproducibility of all the quantities investigated, these findings support the use of multi-fiber OR reconstruction with a limited number of manually drawn ROIs in clinical applications utilizing either OR microstructure characterization or OR dimensions, as is the case in neurosurgical planning for temporal lobectomy.

Common animal models of bone diseases are mice and rats, and it is important to know the reproducibility of the bone measurements in order to correctly interpret results. When performing baseline and follow-up acquisitions, variation in the scan region will influence the parameters, and it has yet to be investigated if three-dimensional (3D) registration can improve the reproducibility. Two typical breeds of mice and one typical breed of rats were scanned four times each using μCT and standard bone morphological and density measurements were calculated. Image registration was used to find the overlapping regions between the scans within each series of animal data and only overlapping regions were analyzed for the bone parameters. Reproducibility was determined for each animal both pre- and post-registration. For the rats, results included a bone volume ratio (BV/TV) precision error of 5.46%, cortical thickness (Ct.Th) error of 1.97%, and tissue mineral density (TMD) of 2.00%. For the BL6 mice, precision errors were 3.00% (BV/TV), 0.95% (Ct.Th), and 0.94% (TMD), and for the C3H mice 2.68% (BV/TV), 1.52% (Ct.Th), and 1.72% (TMD). After image registration there was a significant improvement in reproducibility in most parameters for the rats. In general, metric parameters such as bone volume ratio had better reproducibility than the non-metric parameters connectivity density and structure model index. With 3D registration, reproducibility improved the results obtained by the experienced operators in this study. Registration may serve to equalize reproducibility of operators with different skill levels and across laboratories. It also improves efficiency by reducing the amount of hand-contouring required. This reproducibility data will be important for the interpretation of current and future longitudinal μCT studies.",WOS:000274129400018,BONE

In the latter, research leveraging online social networks (OSNs) must deal with a set of complex issues, such as ensuring data can be collected in an appropriate and reproducible manner. Making research reproducible is difficult, and researchers may need suitable incentives, and tools and systems, to do so. In this paper we explore the state-of-the-art in OSN research reproducibility, and present an architecture to aid reproducibility. We characterise reproducible OSN research using three main themes: reporting of methods, availability of code, and sharing of research data. We survey 505 papers and assess the extent to which they achieve these reproducibility objectives. While systems-oriented papers are more likely to explain data-handling aspects of their methodology, social science papers are better at describing their participant-handling procedures. We then examine incentives to make research reproducible, by conducting a citation analysis of these papers. We find that sharing data is associated with increased citation count, while sharing method and code does not appear to be. Finally, we introduce our architecture which supports the conduct of reproducible OSN research, which we evaluate by replicating an existing research study.","",""

However, the reproducibility of the hole expansion test (HET), a standard testing method established by the international organization for standardization, is quite poor compared with other mechanical testing methods. In this study, we propose a new method, the sheared-edge tensile test (SETT), for evaluating stretch-flangeability with excellent reproducibility. SETT takes into account the deformation behavior during the HET and the critical extrinsic factors influencing the hole expansion ratio (HER). The correlation between the sheared-edge surface characteristics, the tensile properties of the SETT specimen, and stretch-flangeability were investigated to gain in-depth understanding of the proposed evaluation method. Although the correlation between HER and the post-uniform elongation of the SETT specimen with an HER >80% was ambiguous, the SETT results exhibited good reproducibility, and the stretch-flangeability indicated by HER tended to increase linearly with increases in the post-uniform elongation of the SETT specimen. Furthermore, the roughness of the sheared-edge surface had a significant effect on the local deformation behavior of the materials. The proposed method requires only a small amount of specimen, as compared with the HET and can evaluate stretch-flangeability with good reproducibility.",WOS:000412976100001,EXPERIMENTAL MECHANICS

[Subjects and Methods] IAD, a handy tool for assessment of the lateral deviation of vertebrae with a metric scale, was defined as the horizontal distance between one apical vertebra and its counterpart, the opposite apical vertebra in the case of a double curve and the farthest vertebra in the case of a single curve. Fifty full-length, standing anteroposterior radiographs of “idiopathic scoliosis” were reviewed. Three investigators independently measure the CA and IAD at the same time and remeasured the IAD on the same radiograph a week later. [Results] There was no interobserver difference (reliability) in the measurement of IAD or statistical differences in intraobserver reproducibility for each observer. IAD was well correlated with the CA for each observer (r=0.765, r=0.737, and r=0.764). [Conclusion] IAD is useful when assessing lateral deviation in scoliosis and may be a reliable and reproducible index that is well correlated with the CA, and it can be used as a supplementary measure to describe the overall derangement of scoliosis in the coronal plane.","",""

Because ecography and the selection of the area of interest are technician-dependent, the objective of this work was to calculate the reliability and the reproducibility of the analysis method. Material and methods: Test-retest reliability study on 60 cross-sectional patellar ligament ultrasonograms on 1 cm of patella were carried out. Sonosite Titan L-38 (5-10 MHz) and the Image analysis software J v1.40 were used. Morphometric variables were: perimeter, area, width, thickness, and mean echogenity; textural variables were: uniformity, homogeneity and entropy. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated with a confidence interval of 95%. Results: Intraclass correlation coefficients over 0,70 were found, with an agreement ranging from good to very good in all of the variables both for the intra ecography and inter ecography studies. Conclusion: Very good levels of reliability and internal consistency were seen, demonstrating that from the statistical point of view, the variability introduced by the technician is not significant. This method can be taken as a reference to analyze the reliability between several ultrasonographers.","",""

The workshop organizers felt that the traditional model for disseminating scientific knowledge, through pay-walled peer-reviewed journal articles, has become both inefficient and unfair, and that the Open Access to publishing movement solves only part of the problem. The workshop took the four main functions of the academic article as a starting point for the discussion; a) dissemination of scientific knowledge, b) a forum for academic discussion, c) maintaining and monitoring the quality of research and d) determining academic merit. The aim was to reflect on alternative ways of meeting those functions, such that would support the principles of open science (transparency, accessibility, integrity). These alternatives included open research processes, altmetrics and open peer review. The effects of open practices on research integrity were also discussed.

OBJECTIVES: To translate the Modified Fresno Test into Brazilian-Portuguese and to evaluate the test's reproducibility. METHOD: The first step consisted of adapting the instrument into the Brazilian-Portuguese language. Then, a total of 57 participants, including PT students, PT professors and PT practitioners, completed the translated instrument. The responses from the participants were used to evaluate reproducibility of the translated instrument. Internal consistency was calculated using the Cronbach's alpha. Reliability was calculated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous variables, and the Kappa coefficient (K) for categorical variables. The agreement was assessed using the standard error of the measurement (SEM). RESULTS: The cross-cultural adaptation process was appropriate, providing an adequate Brazilian-Portuguese version of the instrument. The internal consistency was good (α=0.769). The reliability for inter- and intra-rater assessment were ICC=0.89 (95% CI 0.82 to 0.93); for evaluator 1 was ICC=0.85 (95% CI 0.57 to 0.93); and for evaluator 2 was ICC=0.98 (95% CI 0.97 to 0.99). The SEM was 13.04 points for inter-rater assessment, 12.57 points for rater 1 and 4.59 points for rater 2. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian-Portuguese language version of the Modified Fresno Test showed satisfactory results in terms of reproducibility.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided bioinformatics developers with a forum for communicating the results of their latest efforts to the wider research community. BOSC offers a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about standards; software development practices; practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems; and approaches that promote open science and sharing of data, results, and software. BOSC is run as a two-day special interest group (SIG) before the annual Intelligent Systems in Molecular Biology (ISMB) conference. BOSC 2015 took place in Dublin, Ireland, and was attended by over 125 people, about half of whom were first-time attendees. Session topics included “Data Science;” “Standards and Interoperability;” “Open Science and Reproducibility;” “Translational Bioinformatics;” “Visualization;” and “Bioinformatics Open Source Project Updates”. In addition to two keynote talks and dozens of shorter talks chosen from submitted abstracts, BOSC 2015 included a panel, titled “Open Source, Open Door: Increasing Diversity in the Bioinformatics Open Source Community,” that provided an opportunity for open discussion about ways to increase the diversity of participants in BOSC in particular, and in open source bioinformatics in general.

All tyres sold in Korea have to carry a label that displays information of two performance criteria: rolling resistance and wet grip. The rolling resistance of the tyres determines their fuel efficiency grading, and the wet grip of the tyres determines their braking safety grading. The rolling resistance and wet grip measurements must be reproducible, so the same tests on the same tyres in different laboratories must produce the same results to ensure a fair comparison between tyres from different suppliers. In addition, a good reproducibility of testing results prevents market surveillance authorities from obtaining results different from those provided by suppliers when testing the same tyres. The laboratory alignment procedure for the rolling resistance measurements was developed and published as the EU Commission Regulation No. 1235 in 2011. However, the laboratory alignment procedure for the wet grip measurements has not yet been developed. Therefore, there are many differences in the wet grip test results among test laboratories throughout the world. The new procedure that is proposed for the wet grip measurement alignment for tyre testing laboratories can improve the reproducibility of the wet grip testing results, and five laboratory alignment tests were carried out between KATECH and five other test laboratories in the world to evaluate the results of the proposed procedure.",WOS:000375449200011,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY

While empirical research suggests that scientists exhibit a \"taste for science,\" such open disclosures can limit a firm's competitive advantage or ability to profitably commercialize their innovations. To explore how this tension is resolved we focus on the strategic interaction between researchers and firms bargaining over whether (and how) knowledge will be disclosed. We evaluate four disclosure strategies: secrecy, patenting, open science (scientific publication) and patent-paper pairs providing insights into the determinants of the disclosure strategy of a firm. We find that patents and publications can be complementary instruments facilitating the disclosure of knowledge-providing predictions as to when stronger IP protection regimes might drive openness by firms.","",""

Methods First, the Oxford Shoulder Score (OSS) was translated into Portuguese by two English professors who did not know the aim of the study. After that the questionnaire was back-translated into English by two native English professors who did not know the questionnaire. These translations were reviewed by a committee (one physician and two PTs) to establish a Brazilian version of the questionnaire to be tested. The first Brazilian version of the OSS was applied in 30 patients with Rheumatoid Arthritis to test the cultural adaptation. The validity and reproducibility of the Brazilian version of OSS was applied in another 30 patients with rheumatoid arthritis with shoulder complains, both genders and who were aged 18 to 65 years. The patients were initially interviewed by two assessors ( interobserver reproducibility ) and after 2 weeks one of these assessors applied the OSS again (intraobserver reproducibility ). The Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for shoulder pain; the Brazilian version of Oxford Shoulder Score; Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand Scale (DASH); Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and Short Form-36 were administered. Results Since all the patients understand the questionnaire, the first version was considered the final version of the Brazilian - OSS. A Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.957 was found. The intraclass intraobserver and interobserver correlation coefficients were 0.917 and 0.861, respectively. The Spearman’s coefficient indicated that there was a high level of correlation of the Oxford Shoulder Score and HAQ (0,663 - p>0.001) and with DASH questionnaire (0,731 - p>0.001) and SF-36 at the domains: physical functioning (-0,589 - p≥0,001); role physical (-0,507 - p≥0,004); bodily pain (-0,624 - p>0,001); general health (-0,444 - p≥0,014); vitality (-0,634 - p>0,001), mental health (-0,578 - p≥0,001). The average administration time for the Oxford Shoulder Score was 2 minutes and 32 seconds. Conclusions The Brazilian version of the Oxford Shoulder Score was successfully translated and adapted, and this version exhibited good internal consistency, reliability and construct validity.

We explored the extent to which published pharmacoepidemiologic studies using commercially available databases could be reproduced by other investigators. We identified a nonsystematic sample of 38 descriptive or comparative safety/effectiveness cohort studies. Seven studies were excluded from reproduction, five because of violation of fundamental design principles, and two because of grossly inadequate reporting.

Methods: As part of a special issue on model sharing and reproducibility in the IEEE Transactions on Biomedical Engineering, two manuscripts on computational biomechanics were submitted: Rajagopal et al., IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016 and Schmitz and Piovesan, IEEE Trans. Biomed. Eng., 2016. Models used in these studies were shared with the scientific reviewers and the public. In addition to the standard review of the manuscripts, the reviewers downloaded the models and performed simulations that reproduced results reported in the studies. Results: There was general agreement between simulation results of the authors and those of the reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved during the necessary revisions. The manuscripts and instructions for download and simulation were updated in response to the reviewers' feedback; changes that may otherwise have been missed if explicit model sharing and simulation reproducibility analysis was not conducted in the review process. Increased burden on the authors and the reviewers, to facilitate model sharing and to repeat simulations, were noted. Conclusion: When the authors of computational biomechanics studies provide access to models and data, the scientific reviewers can download and thoroughly explore the model, perform simulations, and evaluate simulation reproducibility beyond the traditional manuscript-only review process. Significance: Model sharing and reproducibility analysis in scholarly publishing will result in a more rigorous review process, which will enhance the quality of modeling and simulation studies and inform future users of computational models.",WOS:000384570200011,IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING

Progress report from a national and institutional perspective,0,"Watch the VIDEO of the presentation. In January 2013 the Swedish Government commissioned the Swedish Research Council to develop a proposal for national guidelines for open access to scientific information, in collaboration with the National Library of Sweden. Comments from different stakeholders were collected through meetings, dialogues as well as an open web forum during 2013 and 2014. Many of the views expressed were utilized in the final document. The final proposal, which includes guidelines for both scientific publications, artistic works and research data, was submitted to the Government in January 2015. Also, the proposal contains recommendations on what needs to be further investigated and solved, in order to enable the fulfillment of the strategic objectives for 2025, when all scientific publications and artistic works resulting from research financed with public funds shall be published immediately with open access. In December 2015 the Swedish Government invited approximately 100 representatives from HEIs, funders, research and library organizations as well as researchers to a national hearing. The aim was to discuss how Sweden and the government can proceed with the transformation to an open access publishing system. During the hearing it was emphasized that the transformation to an open access publishing system in many respects is connected to the existing qualification and funding allocation system. Therefore there is a need for strong incentives for researchers to publish open access. Also, there is a national and international need to get control of both subscription fees and APCs in order to facilitate the transition to an open access publication system. At the end of 2016 the Government is expected to address the national guidelines in the Budget bill, the Research Bill as well as in different appropriation directives to national HEI’s and funders. Also, the Minister for Research and Higher Education has expressed the will to notify a national coordination task to the National Library of Sweden regarding open access to scientific publications and artistic works and a parallel coordination task to the Swedish Research Council regarding open access to research data. The Swedish Government supports the European Council Conclusions on the transition towards and Open Science System. Our proposed presentation aims to give a state of the art report of the current development, both from a national perspective and from an institutional perspective. How are we are preparing to implement the guidelines? What strategies are institutions and libraries using, both with regard to publishers and researchers? We hope to inspire a discussion and exchange of experiences, since several countries now are in a similar process.","",""

Here we describe our bottom-up approach to developing cyberinfrastructure through a collaborative process engaging a small group of domain and computer scientists and software engineers. We report on a use case evaluated for an Ecosystem Status Report, a multi-disciplinary report inclusive of Earth, life, and social sciences, for the Northeast U.S. Continental Shelf Large Marine Ecosystem. Ultimately, we focused on sharing workflows as a component of the cyberinfrastructure to facilitate collaboration and reproducibility. We developed and deployed a software environment to generate a portion of the Report, retaining traceability of derived datasets including indicators of climate forcing, physical pressures, and ecosystem states. Our solution for sharing workflows and delivering reproducible documents includes IPython (now Jupyter) Notebooks. We describe technical and social challenges that we encountered in the use case and the importance of training to aid the adoption of best practices and new technologies by domain scientists.

To estimate intraobserver and interobserver reproducibility for assigning an International Endometrial Tumor Analysis (IETA) group color score for endometrial vascularization on color Doppler imaging.

Methods
Sixty-eight endometrial 3-dimensional volumes from endometrial color Doppler assessments of women with different endometrial disorders were evaluated by 8 different examiners (4 skilled examiners and 4 obstetric and gynecologic trainees). One skilled examiner who did not participate in the assessments selected the 68 volumes from a database to select a balanced number of each IETA score. Each examiner evaluated the 68 endometrial volumes to assign the IETA color score (1, absence of vascularization; 2, low vascularization; 3, moderate vascularization; or 4, abundant vascularization) using tomographic ultrasound imaging. The analysis was repeated 4 weeks later, and interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility was analyzed by calculating the weighted κ index. The second of the measurements made by each observer was used to estimate interobserver reproducibility.

Results
The intraobserver reproducibility was very good for all examiners, with a weighted κ index ranging from 0.84 to 0.91. The interobserver reproducibility was good or very good for all estimated comparisons, with a weighted κ index ranging from 0.77 to 0.96, regardless of experience level.

Conclusions
The reproducibility of assigning the IETA color score for assessing endometrial vascularization using 3-dimensional volumes is good or very good regardless of the experience of the examiner.",WOS:000403724400007,JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE

Preschoolers show peculiarities that reinforce the importance of assessing their pulmonary function. However, there are few data on the success rate and between-occasions reproducibility of pulmonary function tests in preschoolers, particularly in the Brazilian population.



Objective

To assess the success rate and between-occasions reproducibility of the variables obtained by spirometry and respiratory inductive plethysmography in healthy children aged 4–6 years.



Methods

Breathing pattern was assessed by plethysmography (tidal volume-VT, respiratory rate-f, inspiratory duty cycle-Ti/Ttot, mean respiratory flow-VT/Ti, displacement of the rib cage-RC and phase relation during the total breath-PhRTB) and spirometry (forced vital capacity-FVC, forced expiratory volume in 0.5 sec-FEV0.5 and forced expiratory volume in first second-FEV1) in 47 healthy children, aged 4–6 years. To evaluate between-occasions reproducibility, 10 children (according to the sample size calculation) were reassessed after 3 weeks. Between-occasions reproducibility was evaluated by paired t-test, considering significant P < 0.05, Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation of method error (CVME).



Results

The results showed an 83% success rate for spirometry and a 98% success rate for plethysmography. Regarding reproducibility, there were no significant differences between the variables of any test. Spirometry ICC was above 0.80 and the CVME was lower than 10%. The plethysmography ICC was between 0.61 and 0.95, and the CVME was between 2% and 31%.



Conclusions

These results suggest a high success rate in performing the pulmonary function tests and good between-occasions reproducibility for spirometry and plethysmography in healthy preschoolers. Pediatr Pulmonol. 2013; 48:716–724. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",WOS:000320662700011,PEDIATRIC PULMONOLOGY

Traditionally, many bloggers have assumed that readers are most interested in information presented at prestigious and popular scientific meetings. As a result, the readers and bloggers often ignore blogs of local scientific meetings. We hypothesize that blog readers will utilize blogs about local scientific meetings less than those about national meetings.

We examined nephrology-pertinent blogs from 2010-2012. Blogs were categorized as \"local/regional\" or \"national/international\" based on the majority of the audience that attended the live scientific meeting. We tracked the number of pageviews, reading time, and location of use per blog for the first 90-days after its first availability on the website. Wilcoxon testing was performed on all data.

There were 9 local/regional and 11 national/international scientific meetings for which blogs were available. The mean number of page views was significantly lower in blogs from local/regional than national/international conferences (84.7 versus 160.3, respectively; p < 0.01). However, the mean difference in total reading time between both categories of blogs was not significant (p = 0.25).

Data from this investigation do not fully support the hypothesis that readers utilized local/regional blogs less than national/international blogs. Although local/regional blogs attracted fewer readers (lower pageviews), the content in these blogs was compelling enough to keep the reader equally engaged as with national/international blogs.","",""

The measured vibration data should be available to the end users in the instruction manual issued by the manufacturers, who should follow the procedures specified by a C type European standard. Since the hand held olive harvesters do not have such a standard, manufacturers are not able to provide reliable data. This paper describes a test methodology in view of a C type European standard for these machines. The work started with field activities to collect acceleration data to compare with laboratory results, as requested by the EN ISO 20643. A device to simulate the dynamic vibration response of olive tree branches was then designed, assembled and tested with different configurations, to obtain repeatable acceleration data of hand held olive harvester. When the final prototype was configured, a second laboratory was involved, equipped with a different measurement chain to test the reproducibility. Relevance to industry This paper describes the use of a new custom built device (designed and assembled by the Authors) to simulate the dynamic vibration response of olive tree branches, to obtain repeatable acceleration data of hand held olive harvester. Laboratory tests showed that device can support companies in their task of designing safe and health hand held olive harvesters.",WOS:000341555100013,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL ERGONOMICS

High profile cases, like the discredited cancer research at Duke University or the notorious “Climate‐gate”, can be traced back to poor implementation of checks and balances on standard scientific practice. One remedy is to require researchers to use open methods of analysis, to share software, and to submit only reproducible analysis where it is feasible. Barriers to reproducibility are propriety (closed) software and computer platforms that encourage, rather than prevent, sloppy documentation. It is time to remind ourselves of efforts, perhaps started in the 1980’s, to reestablish standards of reproducibility (see Schwab et al. , 1996).

While the scientific utility of replications is unquestionable, the impact of failed replication efforts and the discussions surrounding them deserve more attention. Specifically, the debates about failed replications on social media have led to worry, in some scientists, regarding reputation. In order to gain data-informed insights into these issues, we collected data from 281 published scientists. We assessed whether scientists overestimate the negative reputational effects of a failed replication in a scenario-based study. Second, we assessed the reputational consequences of admitting wrongness (versus not) as an original scientist of an effect that has failed to replicate. Our data suggests that scientists overestimate the negative reputational impact of a hypothetical failed replication effort. We also show that admitting wrongness about a non-replicated finding is less harmful to one’s reputation than not admitting. Finally, we discovered a hint of evidence that feelings about the replication movement can be affected by whether replication efforts are aimed one’s own work versus the work of another. Given these findings, we then present potential ways forward in these discussions.",WOS:000366903300024,PLOS ONE

To determine the intraexaminer repeatability and interexaminer reproducibility of tear meniscus height (TMH) and noninvasive Keratograph tear breakup time (NIKBUT) measurements obtained with the Keratograph 5M (K5M) in a sample of healthy and dry eye populations. Methods. Forty-two patients with dry eye disease (DED group) and 42 healthy subjects (healthy group) were recruited in this prospective study. In all subjects, each eye received 3 consecutive measurements using the K5M for the TMH and NIKBUTs (NIKBUT-first and NIKBUT-average). And then a different examiner repeated the measurements. The repeatability and reproducibility of measurements were assessed by the coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results. The repeatability and reproducibility of TMH and NIKBUTs were good in both DED and healthy groups (CV% ≤ 26.1% and ICC ≥ 0.75 for all measurements). Patients with DED showed better intraexaminer repeatability for NIKBUTs, but worse for TMH than healthy subjects. Average TMH, NIKBUT-first, and NIKBUT-average were significantly lower in DED group than in healthy group (all values < 0.05). Conclusions. Measurements of TMH and NIKBUTs obtained with the K5M may provide a simple, noninvasive screening test for dry eye with acceptable repeatability and reproducibility.

These principles and guidelines were developed in a workshop that addressed the concern of reproducibility of preclinical research and were built on previous NIH recommendations for transparency in reporting data.1 A major driving force behind this effort stemmed from concerns voiced by the pharmaceutical industry that described their failure to replicate studies performed in academic laboratories2,3 These issues have also attracted attention through commentaries in both scientific journals4 and the lay press.5

As guardians of a large investment of public funds, the NIH aspires to promote confidence in science through enhanced reporting of protocols and data in journals, focusing in particular on reproducibility of results of similar experiments performed in different laboratories. A wide spectrum of scientific leaders, including many journal editors, attended the meeting at which this document was developed. The consequent report emphasized the need for journals to modify their editorial processes in several respects. These included requirement that authors document a detailed description of statistical analyses and data reporting with the aim of increasing transparency, sharing of data and materials, and establishing best practices for reagent verification.

This is especially critical for preclinical studies that were seen as steppingstones to novel therapies. Recognizing the importance of publishing replication studies and reporting negative data, eNeuro will consider such articles; failed preclinical tests are especially welcomed. Here, I consider how failures to replicate should be interpreted and suggest possible new journal practices.

“Rhumba” is a collection term for a group of rattlesnakes, and there is growing concern about a rhumba of “R’s” (replication, reproducibility, rigor, robustness), AKA, the “replication/reproducibility crisis”. Widespread reports of failures to replicate key findings have undermined public confidence in scientific research. Concerns about lack of reproducibility have led to initiatives by scientific societies, journals, and funding agencies to improve scientific rigor with the assumption that this will improve reproducibility.

One of the explicit editorial policies of eNeuro is to consider articles reporting negative results and failures to replicate; failed preclinical tests are especially welcomed. Given this, it’s important to consider how one should interpret failures to replicate when they are published.

The first thing to emphasize is that a failure to replicate doesn’t mean that there is any suspicion of scientific misconduct. A failure to replicate a study published in a peer-reviewed journal simply means that similar results were not found. There are many reasons why this may be the case including that the initial study is correct and the replication study is flawed. Thus, a failure to replicate is simply a call to attention that there is a discrepancy.

When fundamental biological findings are not replicated, science will hopefully self-correct eventually (but see, Ioannidis, 2012). In the interim, faulty conclusions impede the advancement of knowledge and may lead to further faulty conclusions.

In computation research, full replication is often unrealistic for independent results validation, therefore, study reproduction has been justified as the minimum acceptable standard to evaluate the validity of scientific claims. The application of text mining techniques to citation screening in the context of systematic literature reviews is a relatively young and growing computational field with high relevance for software engineering, medical research and other fields. However, there is little work so far on reproduction studies in the field. Objective In this paper, we investigate the reproducibility of studies in this area based on information contained in published articles and we propose reporting guidelines that could improve reproducibility. Methods The study was approached in two ways. Initially we attempted to reproduce results from six studies, which were based on the same raw dataset. Then, based on this experience, we identified steps considered essential to successful reproduction of text mining experiments and characterized them to measure how reproducible is a study given the information provided on these steps. 33 articles were systematically assessed for reproducibility using this approach. Results Our work revealed that it is currently difficult if not impossible to independently reproduce the results published in any of the studies investigated. The lack of information about the datasets used limits reproducibility of about 80% of the studies assessed. Also, information about the machine learning algorithms is inadequate in about 27% of the papers. On the plus side, the third party software tools used are mostly free and available. Conclusions The reproducibility potential of most of the studies can be significantly improved if more attention is paid to information provided on the datasets used, how they were partitioned and utilized, and how any randomization was controlled. We introduce a checklist of information that needs to be provided in order to ensure that a published study can be reproduced.","",""

An incomplete list of these potential biases includes (1) measurement accuracy (ie, Do we measure it in the same way? How much the final result will be affected by different measurement approaches?), (2) measurement reproducibility (how standardized a measurement varies according to different observers, and how standardized imaging collection varies according to different operators/repeated observation by the same operator), (3) physiological variation (How the variation over time is related to growth and age/body size changes?), (4) disease-related variations (How much the variation is pathological?), and (5) environment (patient cooperation/sedation; To what extent variations in basic parameters [ie, heart rate, blood pressure, and loadings conditions] influence our measurements?).

The main goals of this paper were to: (a) formulate an updated Minimum Requirements Report for pollen monitoring; (b) carry out a pilot QC exercise of staff involved in pollen counting from various national networks in order to examine between analysts reproducibility and develop a methodology that can be used in future QC exercises. A questionnaire survey was sent to coordinators of participating pollen monitoring networks. In addition, a total of 45 technicians from 15 European countries participated in the pilot QC exercise. All technicians were instructed to analyse two slides containing the following pollen types: (a) Poaceae and Betula pollen grains in the north of Europe; (b) Poaceae and Olea pollen grains in the south of Europe. Minimum Recommendations were produced based on the results of the questionnaire survey, published literature, and the outcomes of a workshop. In the QC exercise, it was noticed that technicians who followed the Minimum Recommendations and examined at least 10 % of the slide tended to have better indicators of precision and accuracy than those technicians who did not follow the Minimum Recommendations. The proposed Minimum Recommendations will help to improve the quality of scientific work, particularly for those who are considering the setting up of new monitoring sites. The results of the pilot QC exercise will help to develop a methodology that can be used again in the future, thereby ensuring data quality.",WOS:000344625800004,AEROBIOLOGIA

However, little is known regarding how scientists considering jobs in industrial R&D make trade-offs between positions that allow publishing on the one hand and positions that do not allow publishing but offer higher pay on the other. Using data on over 1900 science and engineering PhD candidates about to enter the job market, we find that while some are unwilling to give up publishing at virtually any price, over one third of those most likely to seek positions in industrial research are willing to forego publishing for free. We develop a simple model of the “price” scientists assign to publishing in firms and explore potential sources of heterogeneity empirically. We find that the price of publishing increases with individuals’ preferences for various benefits from publishing such as peer recognition and contributing to society, but it decreases with their preference for money. Scientists who believe themselves to be of high ability and who train at top tier institutions have a higher price of publishing. Yet, they are more expensive to hire (not less) even if publishing is allowed. We discuss implications for research on the economics of science and on compensating differentials, for managers seeking to attract and retain academically trained personnel, and for firms considering their participation in open science.","",""

Methods: Using the data of 166 patients with unprotected left main lesions treated with the second generation everolimus-eluting stent, we sought to analyze SYNTAX score assessment provided by one junior and two independent senior observers and to assess the impact of the quality of angiographies on the reproducibility of SYNTAX score determination. Intra-observer variability was assessed by a senior observer by analyzing 50 sets of angiograms after an interval of at least 6 weeks. Results: The weighted kappa value for the inter-observer reproducibility of SYNTAX score classified as tertiles, according to SYNTAX trial, was 0.71 and the intra-observer weighted kappa value was 0.79. When compared with junior's measurements, SYNTAX score assessed by senior investigators was 0.46 and 0.50. Changes in SYNTAX score classification were arbitrarily responsible for changes in weighted kappa values. Angiograms showing the higher rates of discrepancies between observers were of lower quality, when compared with random angiograms. SYNTAX score was closely correlated to 1-year incidence of major adverse cerebro- and cardiovascular events for both junior and senior readers. Conclusions: SYNTAX score was slightly underestimated by junior reader, when compared with experienced operators. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of experienced operators was very acceptable. SYNTAX score evaluation was clearly related to the quality of angiograms. SYNTAX score was correlated to 1-year incidence of major cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) in all readers. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",WOS:000306645900020,CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS

The objective of this study was to examine the validity and reproducibility of self-reported working hours among Japanese male employees.The participants were 164 male employees of four large-scale companies in Japan. For validity, the Spearman correlation between self-reported working hours in the second survey and the working hours recorded by the company was calculated for the following four time frames: daily working hours, monthly overtime working hours in the last month, average overtime working hours in the last 3 months, and the frequency of long working months (≥45 h/month) within the last 12 months. For reproducibility, the intraclass correlation between the first (September 2013) and second surveys (December 2013) was calculated for each of the four time frames.The Spearman correlations between self-reported working hours and those based on company records were 0.74, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.89 for daily, monthly, 3-monthly, and yearly time periods, respectively. The intraclass correlations for self-reported working hours between the two questionnaire surveys were 0.63, 0.66, 0.73, and 0.87 for the respective time frames.The results of the present study among Japanese male employees suggest that the validity of self-reported working hours is high for all four time frames, whereas the reproducibility is moderate to high.",WOS:000385911700003,JOURNAL OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

To evaluate fiber tracking strategy in terms of acquisition schemes in conjunction with four algorithms used in clinical routine, we studied one of the major tracts, anatomically well known, and which should be preserved as much as possible during neurosurgery: the corticospinal tract.



Materials and Methods:

Two identical exams, composed of three DTI acquisition schemes (6, 15, and 32 gradient directions), were performed on 12 healthy subjects during two different sessions. For each subject, intra-operator, and inter-exam reproducibility was quantitatively calculated from different fiber tracking algorithms: three deterministic and a probabilistic one. Inter-exam reproducibility was evaluated comparing fiber tracking results from the repetition of the same acquisition one month apart and variation of the fiber density distribution percentile.



Results:

For each fiber tracking algorithm, the best reproducibility result is obtained in case of 50% of fiber density and for the number of directions equal to 32. The reproducibility is improved using the probabilistic algorithm.



Conclusion:

This study highlights increased reliability of reproducibility results based on the number of directions used during the acquisition. The method of tractography used and the choice of adequate density fiber tract greatly improve the results. J. Magn. Reson.

Methods Ten parameters of maximum diameter in 68 native AAA were measured double-blind by three radiologists on orthogonal planes, curved multiplanar reconstructions, and, finally, using semi-automated software. The semi-automated software creates the AAA lumen centreline and automatically provides cross sections perpendicular to this centreline. The maximum diameter in any direction is automatically calculated once the slice of interest has been selected. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility and discordance >5 mm were analysed. Results Intra-observer reproducibility was high. The limits of agreement were within the clinically accepted range [−5; +5 mm] in 27/30 (90%) comparisons. The method common to all three observers that yielded the lowest values was the semi-automated method. Inter-observer reproducibility was poorer. The limits were outside the clinically accepted range in 26/30 (87%) comparisons. The semi-automated method led to lower intra- (0%) and inter-observer (5.88%) discordances rates. Conclusion Even using precise methodology, the reproducibility of maximum diameter measurements of native AAA on CTA may exceed recommended thresholds.

To have confidence in this methodology, it is necessary to ensure that a similar product profile would emerge if the test was repeated. Also, deciding whether the study should be replicated or not is a key issue in test implementation. In this context, the aim of the present work was to evaluate global and individual reproducibility of projective mapping for sensory characterization with consumers and to evaluate the influence of the size of difference among samples. Six consumer studies were conducted using a test–retest paradigm. In each study, responses from the same group of consumers to the same sample set in two different sessions were compared. Across the six studies, individual reproducibility tended to be low. However, the RV coefficients of consensus sample configurations between sessions were higher than 0.75, suggesting that test–retest reproducibility of projective mapping with consumers proved to be relatively high.



Practical Applications

The present work provides evidence of the reproducibility of projective mapping for sensory characterization with consumers. Although sample configurations were stable, some differences in conclusions regarding similarities and differences among samples were identified between sessions. This indicates that care must be taken when relying on results of projective mapping with consumers obtained without the use of replicates, particularly when working with sample sets with small differences. Results from the present work showed that stability indices of sample configurations based on bootstrapping resampling approaches were related to global reproducibility. These indices could be useful to decide whether or not it is necessary to replicate projective mapping in order to ensure that conclusions regarding similarities and differences among samples would be repeatedly identified. This is of particular interest, considering the difficulty of asking consumers to attend separate sessions.",WOS:000331389600008,JOURNAL OF SENSORY STUDIES

This study quantifies repeatability and reproducibility (R&R) of brake-specific particle number (BSPN) measurements by using three AVL particle counters (APC) under actual testing conditions. The study was conducted on a single, heavy duty diesel engine (2007 Cummins ISX 14.8 L 425 HP) equipped with a diesel oxidation catalyst and a diesel particulate filter (DPF). The conditioning of the DPF played a significant role in characterizing variation in particle number measurements. The R&R values were quantified based on 53 US on-highway transient Federal Test Procedure (FTP) test cycles with the total of 149 BSPN observations collected over the period of 68 days in five Constant Volume Sampler (CVS) test cells. The global average of the 149 BSPN observations (1.3918E + 11 #/kW-h) was used to calculate relative variation in BSPN for both the entire test process and for the APC units only. The BSPN measurement repeatability and reproducibility were 2.5 and 31.7 % of the global average, respectively. The variation due to measurement systems (APC) were 0.69 % (repeatability) and 6.2 % (reproducibility) of the global average. Most of the variation was due to reproducibility which comprised of 99.4 % of the total variation. The coefficient of variation (COV) of BSPN among three APC units varied between −19.1 and 17.9 % on 49 FTP test cycles. Overall, the very high reproducibility and COV between units suggest that the instrument should be checked for drift periodically. The frequent in-use calibration checks are required for various components of the particle number measurement system to ensure quality data required for engine certification.","",""

To evaluate intraobserver and interobserver agreements of anterior chamber angle measurements in children using hand-held spectral domain optical coherence tomography (HH-SDOCT).

Methods
HH-SDOCT (Leica Microsystems Ltd) was used to scan the anterior chamber of 30 normal children (mean age = 5.12 ± 3.5 years, range: 2 days to 12 years). Two independent observers analysed the same B-scan showing both clear nasal and temporal angles using ImageJ. They identified iridocorneal angle landmarks: scleral spur (SS), Schwalbe`s line (SL) and angle recess (AR) and used them to calculate parameters such as trabecular meshwork length (TML), SS angle opening distance (SSAOD), SL angle opening distance (SLAOD), SL angle (SLA), SS limbal distance (SSLD), SL limbal distance (SLLD), trabecular iris surface area (TISA500), nasal to temporal SS distance (SS-SSD) and pupil diameter (PD). The reproducibility of measurements were assessed using interclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots.

Results
Repeated measurements of anterior chamber were calculated in 141 images. Both intra-observer and inter-observer agreements of most measurements ranged from fair to excellent (0.66 to 0.97). Intra-observer and inter-observer ICC for SSAOD, SLAOD, SLA, SSLD, SLLD, TISA500, SS-SSD and PD were 0.74, 0.78, 0.81, 0.72, 0.80, 0.76, 0.96, 0.96 and 0.83, 0.85, 0.77, 0.91, 0.89, 0.83, 0.84, 0.97, respectively. TML reproducibility was poor, ICC were 0.42 and 0.33, respectively. Bland Altman plots showed no significant difference between repeated measurements (p value were >0.05) for parameters with ICC reproducibility ≥0.7.

Conclusions
Reproducible quantitative measurements in children using HH-SDOCT was possible with ICC of up to 0.97. Anterior segment OCT could be a potential method in understanding the normal and abnormal ocular development of children.","",""

The reachable workspace, i.e. the area covered by the farthest points a subject can reach by hand without moving his/her body, shows promise but has yet to be validated, particularly in terms of reproducibility. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the reproducibility of the reachable workspace over a period of several weeks, and to assess the effects of two proposed acquisition protocols, as well as those of gender, and hand dominancy. Shoulder movements were recorded using a motion capture system on 10 female and 10 male healthy subjects during a random protocol, i.e. simply asking them to achieve the farthest points they could reach with their hands, and during a standardized protocol, i.e. asking them to perform predefined shoulder elevations while keeping their trunk and elbow straight. The standardized protocol was repeated 7 weeks later. Repeated measures showed no significant difference, good to excellent intraclass correlation coefficients (0.46–0.81) and small bias (0.0–1.2%). The random protocol provided significantly lower and more scattered values for the reachable workspace (80.0 ± 22.6% vs. 91.0 ± 8.1%, p = .004), whereas gender and hand-dominancy had no effect. This study showed that the reachable workspace was highly reliable over a period of 7 weeks and that both upper limbs provided similar results. It could be used to monitor various pathologies of the upper limbs and to assess treatment efficiency, using a subject’s healthy limb as reference.","",""

To show how and why attacks spread more readily around the grid, we first discuss how collaborations manifest themselves in the grids and form the collaboration network graph, and how this collaboration network graph affects the security threat levels of grid participants. We present two mixed-integer program (MIP) models to find the optimal response to attacks in open grid environments, and also calculate the threat level associated with each grid participant.

With every passing year, the amount of gap and difference of the patient fixation has decreased. Conclusion: By the improvement of the use of the immobilization device, gap and difference of fixation has decreased. Accordingly, we could obtain better accuracy of fixation.","",""

In many laboratories, it is common to store data on one computing system and process data on another system. This separation of storing and processing data has a negative impact on the traceability of results, and thus on reproducibility, as information has to be manually transferred between these systems. We resolve this difficulty by introducing a novel system called Omero Processing Extension (OPE) that generates a description of the execution of a workflow and annotates the calculation results automatically. This way, OPE establishes a bridge between storage and processing. Plugins provide support for version control to link program sources with the executed workflow. In addition, a web interface provides access to OPE improving the reproducibility with minimal overhead for the user.","",""

Findings of the study will provide valuable information for probability‐based treatment planning. Methods: Ten lungcancer patients who underwent SBRTtreatment were included in this study. All treatment plans were created using 3D‐conformal technique with 8 to 11 beams and wedges. Cine‐MV images were acquired during treatment for each beam at a rate of 1 frame/sec. Tumor motion tracking was achieved using an cross‐correlation algorithm. Tumor motion trajectories were extracted for all beams in all fractions of all patients. Inaccurate tracking results (based on visual inspection) were removed from further study. Only 3 beams with the best tracking results from each fraction were used to calculate the tumor motion PDF, which is defined as the probability of finding the tumor at different positions. For each patient the tumor motion PDF was generated for each fraction (PDFn) using the 3 selected beams and a mean PDF (PDFm) was generated as the mean of all fractional PDFs. Inter‐fractional PDF reproducibility (Rn) was calculated by comparing PDFn to PDFm. Mean tumor motion range (Dm) was determined for each patient and correlated to the mean PDF reproducibility (Rm). Results: Inter‐fractional PDF reproducibility of lungtumor motion ranged from 0.750 to 0.986 among all patients. Mean PDF reproducibility of the patient (Rm) ranged from 0.840 to 0.954, with an average of 0.89± 0.05. Mean PDF reproducibility decreased exponentially as a function of the mean tumor motion range: Rm=0.15exp(−0.45Dm)+0.85. Conclusions: Tumor motion PDF for lungSBRT patients can be determined using cine‐MV images. PDF reproducibility varied between patients and decreased exponentially as tumor motion range increased.",WOS:000411567000053,MEDICAL PHYSICS

METHODS: Twenty healthy volunteers (10 female, 10 male) underwent the 13C-MBT after intake of 75 mg 13C-methacetin p.o. on three occasions. Short- and medium-term reproducibility was assessed with paired examinations taken at an interval of 2 and 18 d (medians), respectively.

RESULTS: The reproducibility of the 1-h cumulative 13C recovery (AUC0-60), characterized by a coefficient of variation of 10%, appeared to be considerably better than the reproducibility of the maximum momentary 13C recovery or the time of reaching it. Remarkably, as opposed to the short gap between consecutive examinations, the capacity of the liver to handle 13C-methacetin increased slightly but statistically significantly when a repeat dose was administered after two to three weeks. Regarding the AUC0-60, the magnitude of this fixed bias amounted to 7.5%. Neither the time gap between the repeat examinations nor the gender of the subjects affected the 13C-MBT reproducibility.

CONCLUSION: 13C-MBT is most reproducibly quantified by the cumulative 13C recovery, but the exactitude thereof may be modestly affected by persistent stimulation of CYP1A2 on repeat examinations.",WOS:000298171000006,WORLD JOURNAL OF GASTROENTEROLOGY

Reproducibility is a necessary condition for replicability, because an inability to reproduce results implies that the methods have not been specified sufficiently, thus precluding replication. This paper describes how two independent teams of researchers attempted to reproduce the empirical findings of an important paper, “Shrinkage estimators of time series seasonal factors and their effect on forecasting accuracy” (Miller & Williams, 2003). The two teams proceeded systematically, reporting results both before and after receiving clarifications from the authors of the original study. The teams were able to approximately reproduce each other’s results, but not those of Miller and Williams. These discrepancies led to differences in the conclusions as to the conditions under which seasonal damping outperforms classical decomposition. The paper specifies the forecasting methods employed using a flowchart. It is argued that this approach to method documentation is complementary to the provision of computer code, as it is accessible to a broader audience of forecasting practitioners and researchers. The significance of this research lies not only in its lessons for seasonal forecasting but also, more generally, in its approach to the reproduction of forecasting research.",WOS:000347665900006,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING

We assessed intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility of AIM analysis-derived variables; the diagnostic accuracy of AIM-based criteria for detecting aspiration was determined by using expertly scored videofluoroscopy as the standard. Methods Data on 50 bolus swallows of 10 mL each were randomly selected from a database of swallows that were simultaneously recorded with impedance, manometry, and videofluoroscopy. Data were divided into 5 subgroups of 10 swallows for analysis: 10 dysphagic liquid, 10 dysphagic liquid with aspiration, 10 dysphagic semisolid, 10 control liquid, and 10 control semisolid. Repeat analyses were performed by 10 observers with varying levels of expertise in manometry by using purpose-designed software (AIMplot). Swallow videos were scored by 4 experts by using the penetration-aspiration scale (PAS) score. Reproducibility of calculation of swallow function variables and the SRI and PAS was assessed by using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The majority consensus of expert PAS scores was used to dichotomously define aspiration (consensus PAS >3). Observer analyses were compared by Cohen κ statistical analysis. Results The intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility of swallow function variables was high (SRI mean intra-rater ICC, 0.97 and mean inter-rater ICC, 0.91). SRI >15–20 was optimal for detecting the presence of aspiration during liquid bolus swallows with an almost perfect agreement with expert scoring of videofluoroscopy (κ > 0.8). Conclusions AIM analysis has high intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility, and among observers of varying expertise, SRI predicts the presence of aspiration.",WOS:000295735900018,CLINICAL GASTROENTEROLOGY AND HEPATOLOGY

Inter-study reproducibility is important for serial assessments however has not been defined for CMR-FT. Methods: 16 healthy volunteers were imaged 3 times within a single day. The first examination was performed at 0900 after fasting and was immediately followed by the second. The third, non-fasting scan, was performed at 1400. CMR-FT measures of segmental and global strain parameters were calculated. Left ventricular (LV) circumferential and radial strain were determined in the short axis orientation (EccSAX and ErrSAX respectively). LV and right ventricular longitudinal strain and LV radial strain were determined from the 4-chamber orientation (EllLV, EllRV, and ErrLAX respectively). LV volumes and function were also analysed. Inter-study reproducibility and study sample sizes required to demonstrate 5% changes in absolute strain were determined by comparison of the first and second exams. The third exam was used to determine whether diurnal variation affected reproducibility. Results: CMR-FT strain analysis inter-study reproducibility was variable. Global strain assessment was more reproducible than segmental analysis. Overall EccSAX was the most reproducible measure of strain: coefficient of variation (CV) 38% and 20.3% and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.68 (0.55-0.78) and 0.7 (0.32-0.89) for segmental and global analysis respectively. The least reproducible segmental measure was EllRV: CV 60% and ICC 0.56 (0.41-0.69) whilst the least reproducible global measure was ErrLAX: CV 33.3% and ICC 0.44 (0–0.77). Variable reproducibility was also reflected in the calculated sample sizes, which ranged from 11 (global EccSAX) to 156 subjects (segmental EllRV). The reproducibility of LV volumes and function was excellent. There was no diurnal variation in global strain or LV volumetric measurements. Conclusions: Inter-study reproducibility of CMR-FT varied between different parameters, as summarized above and was better for global rather than segmental analysis. It was not measurably affected by diurnal variation. CMR-FT may have potential for quantitative wall motion analysis with applications in patient management and clinical trials. However, inter-study reproducibility was relatively poor for segmental and long axis analyses of strain, which have yet to be validated, and may benefit from further development.",WOS:000308554500001,JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE

This study is based on 22 in-depth interviews with U.K. researchers in systems biology, synthetic biology, and bioinformatics, which were conducted between September 2013 and February 2014. Through an analysis of the interview transcripts, we identify seven core themes that characterize researchers’ understanding of openness in science and nine factors that shape the practice of openness in research. Our findings highlight the implications that Open Science policies can have for research processes and outcomes and provide recommendations for enhancing their content, effectiveness, and implementation.","",""

To detect changes in excitability in longitudinal studies, it is important to validate the repeatability of TMS outcomes for the same subject between different sessions. Previous studies in healthy subjects found mixed degrees of reproducibility, ranging from poor to good agreement (Badawy et al., 2012; Du et al., 2014) . Especially, the long intracortical inhibition (LICI) curve showed a large variability across sessions (Du et al., 2014) . Objective To evaluate the reproducibility of the LICI curve in healthy subjects using paired pulse TMS. Subjects & methods Twenty-seven healthy subjects were studied two times ( ± 1 week apart) with paired pulse TMS combined with electromyography. Both motor hot spots (abductor digiti minimi) were stimulated with 50 paired pulses (intensity 120% of resting motor threshold) at interstimulus intervals (ISIs): 100, 150, 200, 250 and 300 ms. In nineteen subjects a figure-of-eight coil was positioned and held in place manually during both sessions, while in eight subjects a robotic arm was used. The concordance correlation coefficient (rho-c) was used to estimate the agreement between repeated sessions (Lin, 1989) . Results The average LICI curve among all subjects showed a close agreement between TMS sessions for manual (rho-c  = 0.88) and robot-guided (rho-c  = 0.95) positioning. However, the reproducibility decreased when individual LICI curves were compared; manual (rho-c  = 0.66) and robot-guided (rho-c  = 0.86). There was a large variation in reproducibility between subjects, ranging from poor to good levels of agreement. Additionally, moderate levels of agreement and a large variation was found for individual ISIs: manual (range rho-c: 0.42–0.55) versus robot-guided (range rho-c: 0.62–0.89). Conclusion Reproducibility of LICI curves was highly variable between healthy subjects. Good levels of agreement were found for analysis on group levels, but reproducibility decreased for the level of individual subjects or ISIs. Overall, reproducibility of the LICI curve was higher for robot-guided than for manual coil positioning.","",""

Material and methods After selecting 23 cases of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma from the Xeral-Cies Hospital, Meixoeiro Hospital and POVISA Hospital from the last 15 years, an informative meeting on the Paner et al. grading system criteria was held. After, the participating pathologists applied the system to each case, evaluating one slide selected. Kappa index for interobserver reproducibility was calculated, and it was classified according to the Landis and Koch scale. Results The grading distribution was similar for most of the 6 participating observers, with grade 1 predominance. The remaining 2 observers considered a relatively higher proportion of grade 2. Kappa index values ranged from 0.136 to 0.674, with a discrete-moderate reproducibility index predominance (0.21–0.60). Highest Kappa value (0.674) was obtained between the most novel and the most expert interobservers. The lowest Kappa value was obtained among the most veteran pathologists (0.136). Conclusions Interobserver reproducibility for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma is discrete-moderate in our institutions when the novel grade proposed by Paner et al. is used. Labeling of grades 1 and 2 is not homogeneous among 6 participating observers. While awaiting a grading consensus on a new classification by the scientific societies, we consider that the routine use of a grading system for chromophobe renal cell carcinoma should not be used.","",""

Objective To determine, for a number of techniques used to obtain foot shape based around plaster casting, foam box impressions, and 3-dimensional scanning, (1) the effect the technique has on the overall reproducibility of custom foot orthoses (FOs) in terms of inter- and intracaster reliability and (2) the reproducibility of FO design by using computer-aided design (CAD) software in terms of inter- and intra-CAD operator reliability for all these techniques. Design Cross-sectional study. Setting University laboratory. Participants Convenience sample of individuals (N=22) with noncavus foot types. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures Parameters of the FO design (length, width at forefoot, width at rearfoot, and peak medial arch height), the forefoot to rearfoot angle of the foot shape, and overall volume match between device designs. Results For intra- and intercaster reliability of the different methods of obtaining the foot shape, all methods fell below the reproducibility quality threshold for the medial arch height of the device, and volume matching was 0.75) for all variables with the exception of forefoot to rearfoot angle, with overall volume matches of >87% of the devices. Conclusions None of the techniques for obtaining foot shape met all the criteria for excellent reproducibility, with the peak arch height being particularly variable. Additional variability is added at the CAD stage of the FO design process, although with adequate operator experience good to excellent reproducibility may be achieved at this stage.

When proposing new algorithms, researchers should compare them against finely-tuned implementations of the leading prior algorithms using state-of-the-art evaluation methodologies.

Event- and interval-based measurements are two different ways of computing frequency of stuttering. Interval-based methodology emerged as an alternative measure to overcome problems associated with reproducibility in the event-based methodology. No review has been made to study the effect of methodological factors in interval-based absolute reliability data or to compute the agreement between the two methodologies in terms of inter-judge, intra-judge and accuracy (i.e., correspondence between raters’ scores and an established criterion).



Aims

To provide a review related to reproducibility of event-based and time-interval measurement, and to verify the effect of methodological factors (training, experience, interval duration, sample presentation order and judgment conditions) on agreement of time-interval measurement; in addition, to determine if it is possible to quantify the agreement between the two methodologies



Methods & Procedures

The first two authors searched for articles on ERIC, MEDLINE, PubMed, B-on, CENTRAL and Dissertation Abstracts during January–February 2013 and retrieved 495 articles. Forty-eight articles were selected for review. Content tables were constructed with the main findings.



Main Contribution

Articles related to event-based measurements revealed values of inter- and intra-judge greater than 0.70 and agreement percentages beyond 80%. The articles related to time-interval measures revealed that, in general, judges with more experience with stuttering presented significantly higher levels of intra- and inter-judge agreement. Inter- and intra-judge values were beyond the references for high reproducibility values for both methodologies. Accuracy (regarding the closeness of raters’ judgements with an established criterion), intra- and inter-judge agreement were higher for trained groups when compared with non-trained groups. Sample presentation order and audio/video conditions did not result in differences in inter- or intra-judge results. A duration of 5 s for an interval appears to be an acceptable agreement. Explanation for high reproducibility values as well as parameter choice to report those data are discussed.



Conclusions & Implications

Both interval- and event-based methodologies used trained or experienced judges for inter- and intra-judge determination and data were beyond the references for good reproducibility values. Inter- and intra-judge values were reported in different metric scales among event- and interval-based methods studies, making it unfeasible to quantify the agreement between the two methods.",WOS:000348846400002,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE & COMMUNICATION DISORDERS

Recent advances in Bayesian hypothesis testing have led to the development of uniformly most powerful Bayesian tests, which represent an objective, default class of Bayesian hypothesis tests that have the same rejection regions as classical significance tests. Based on the correspondence between these two classes of tests, it is possible to equate the size of classical hypothesis tests with evidence thresholds in Bayesian tests, and to equate P values with Bayes factors. An examination of these connections suggest that recent concerns over the lack of reproducibility of scientific studies can be attributed largely to the conduct of significance tests at unjustifiably high levels of significance. To correct this problem, evidence thresholds required for the declaration of a significant finding should be increased to 25–50:1, and to 100–200:1 for the declaration of a highly significant finding. In terms of classical hypothesis tests, these evidence standards mandate the conduct of tests at the 0.005 or 0.001 level of significance.",WOS:000327390400051,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

A comprehensive indicator of method performance permits direct comparison between methods and facilitates the evaluation of multiple, yet contradictory statistics. The European Union Reference Laboratory for GM Food and Feed has already proposed the fuzzy principle in the context of method validation. Other studies have also proved its applicability in other areas of GMO analysis, but the application has been limited hitherto. In this article, we review the fuzzy logic principle and its potential to support the continuous progress of GMO science and routine laboratory analyses.",WOS:000284242700006,ACCREDITATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

If the precision (reproducibility) of virtual 3D model analysis can be further improved, digital orthodontics could be even more widely accepted. The purpose of this study was to clarify the influence of “standardization” of the target points for dental cast analysis using virtual 3D models. Physical plaster models were also measured to obtain additional information. Methods Five sets of dental casts were used. The dental casts were scanned with R700 (3Shape, Copenhagen, Denmark) and REXCAN DS2 3D (Solutionix, Seoul, Korea) scanners. In this study, 3 system and software packages were used: SureSmile (OraMetrix, Richardson, Tex), Rapidform (Inus, Seoul, Korea), and I-DEAS (SDRC, Milford, Conn). Results Without standardization, the maximum differences were observed between the SureSmile software and the Rapidform software (0.39 mm ± 0.07). With standardization, the maximum differences were observed between the SureSmile software and measurements with a digital caliper (0.099 mm ± 0.01), and this difference was significantly greater ( P Conclusions The results showed that elimination of the influence of usability or habituation is important for improving the reproducibility of dental cast analysis.",WOS:000350447200020,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

This study evaluates the inter-site and intra-site reproducibility of 7 Tesla brain imaging and compares it to literature values for other field strengths.

Materials and methods
The same two subjects were imaged at eight different 7 T sites. MP2RAGE, TSE, TOF, SWI, EPI as well as B1 and B0 field maps were analyzed quantitatively to assess inter-site reproducibility. Intra-site reproducibility was measured with rescans at three sites.

Results
Quantitative measures of MP2RAGE scans showed high agreement. Inter-site and intra-site reproducibility errors were comparable to 1.5 and 3 T. Other sequences also showed high reproducibility between the sites, but differences were also revealed. The different RF coils used were the main source for systematic differences between the sites.

Conclusion
Our results show for the first time that multi-center brain imaging studies of the supratentorial brain can be performed at 7 T with high reproducibility and similar reliability as at 3T.

Because of the data and compute intensive behavior of the scientific workflows parallel and distributed system (grids, clusters, clouds and supercomputers) are required to execute them. After all the complexity of these infrastructures and the continuously changing environment significantly encumber or even prevent the repeatability or the reproducibility which is often needed for results sharing or for judging scientific claims. The necessary data and parameters of the re-execution can be originated from different sources (infrastructural, third party, or related to the binaries), which may change or become unavailable during the years. Our ultimate goal is to compensate the lack of the original parameters by replacing, evaluating or simulating the value of the parameters in dispute. In order to create these methods we determined the levels of the re-execution and we defined a descriptor-space to collect all the parameters needed to the reproducibility.

Materials and Methods: From a database containing 780 images taken following a standardized method for 65 RDPs, 55 images were randomly selected for image analysis. Adobe Photoshop software was used according to standard operating procedure (SOP) by one main examiner two times in different sessions, and one time by three additional examiners. To estimate the intra- and interexaminer reliability, intraclass correlation coefficient ICC(2,1) were used. Three parameters were used to estimate agreement: standard error of measurement (SEM), smallest detectable change at the 95% confidence level (SDC95%), and limits of agreement (LoA) according to the Bland-Altman method. 
Results: In all steps of the image analysis, both intra- and interexaminer reliability were excellent, with ICC(2,1) values > 0.85 at the 95% confidence level. The intra- and interexaminer values for both the SEMagreement and SDC95% were ≤ 6% and ≤ 17%, respectively. The Bland-Altman analysis revealed a satisfactory level of agreement. 
Conclusion: This study shows excellent inter- and intraexaminer reproducibility, a satisfactory level of examiner agreement, and acceptable measurement error. Furthermore, the method can be used with all types of RDPs. The CPM is more suitable for clinical research because of its objectivity, reliability, high level of standardization, and ability to detect and quantify small changes in plaque.",WOS:000406081400012,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS

As such, it is important not only to take care of the needs of the elderly, but also to place their reality in the forefront of deliberations and actions. Now that we are in the so-called 'century of biology', we must ensure that the newly transformed and increasingly relied on biosciences not only respond to the needs of the elderly but also reflect the reality of the elderly. While many arguments can be made in support of increased data-sharing in biomedical research (and indeed within and across healthcare systems more generally), there are some persuasive age-based arguments that might serve to encourage science regulators, through both funding structures and the law, to fundamentally reshape the research environment so as to enhance its potential to achieve public goods such as improved health and more effective healthcare systems.

Here we address the future of cheminformatics with primary focus on innovation. Cheminformatics developers often need to choose between “mainstream” (i.e., accepted, expected) and novel, leading-edge tools, with an increasing trend for open science. Possible futures for cheminformatics include the worst case scenario (lack of funding, no creative usage), as well as the best case scenario (complete integration, from systems biology to virtual physiology). As “-omics” technologies advance, and computer hardware improves, compounds will no longer be profiled at the molecular level, but also in terms of genetic and clinical effects. Among potentially novel tools, we anticipate machine learning models based on free text processing, an increased performance in environmental cheminformatics, significant decision-making support, as well as the emergence of robot scientists conducting automated drug discovery research. Furthermore, cheminformatics is anticipated to expand the frontiers of knowledge and evolve in an open-ended, extensible manner, allowing us to explore multiple research scenarios in order to avoid epistemological “local information minimum trap”.",WOS:000299929400024,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER-AIDED MOLECULAR DESIGN

This report assesses the utility of the correlation coefficient in the analysis of reproducibility and reliability of gene expression data. Results: The correlation coefficient alone is not sufficient to assess equality among sample replicates but when coupled with slope and scatter plots expression data equality can be better assessed. Narrow-intervals of scatter plots should be shown as a tool to inspect the actual level of noise within the data. Here we propose a method to examine expression data reproducibility, which is based on the ratios of both the means and the standard deviations for the inter-treatment expression ratios of genes. In addition, we introduce a fold-change threshold with an inter-replicate occurrence likelihood lower than 5% to perform analysis even when reproducibility is not acceptable. There is no possibility to find a perfect correlation between transcript and protein levels even when there is not any post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism. We therefore propose an adjustment for protein abundance with that of transcript abundance based on open reading frame length. Conclusions: Here, we introduce a very efficient reproducibility approach. Our method detects very small changes in large datasets which was not possible through regular correlation analysis. We also introduce a correction on protein quantities which allows us to examine the post-transcriptional regulatory effects with a higher accuracy.",WOS:000342787200003,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL RESEARCH-THESSALONIKI

Planning of support services with themes of open access scholarly publishing, open research data and open study material began at full throttle at the UEF Library in November 2015. Information specialists were grouped into teams, which orientated to separate aspects of open science and shared their knowledge by training the whole library staff. Teamwork continued actively over the year 2016. Open science continuously brings new tasks for the Library and has already notably changed the job profiles of the library specialists. Advancing open science has been considered highly important not only at the library but also at the university level. UEF has offered resources e.g. by recruiting new information specialists and a data protection officer and internal auditor. UEF Library has a vital role in conducting open science but it is practiced in close collaboration with University Services, especially that of Development Services, General Administration and Legal Services and IT Services. Open Science team has landed the departments to share information and to discuss about open science practices at UEF. Nowadays these roadshows concerning UEF publishing and data policy, open access (OA) publishing as well as research data management and sharing are our focal operation. Work continues but the results can already be seen: In the OA ranking of research organisations in Finland (Ministry of Education and Culture of Finland), UEF has achieved level four in the five-level maturity model. Also, UEF researchers can order tailored training sessions about open research and support services from the diverse training menu offered by the Library. Updated Open UEF web pages are available for everyone and multi-channeled informing directed to UEF staff and students continues online. One concrete output from conducted open science and active campaigning about self-archiving is UEF institutional publication repository, UEF//eRepository, which was launched in February 2017. At the moment about 31% of UEF scientific publications are open access, but substantial increase is expected. The next big challenge in open research is data management and opening. UEF Library is starting to build a metadata portal for research data in order to conceive the data produced by UEF researchers and to help finding data for potential reuse. Open science will also be included in information retrieval studies of master's degree and doctoral students.

Central to this are complex processes of delegation - in which organizational work and agency are passed back and forth across the shifting line between ''social'' and ''technical'' elements. Building on work in the sociology of science, this paper extends the concept of delegation and applies it to thorny questions around the work of sustaining organization over time. We explore two examples from the Open Science Grid (OSG), an initiative that distributes computational resources to geographically dispersed and otherwise loosely coordinated research teams. Our first case is one of successful delegation, as automated access to resources is extended to a new group of distributed scientists. We then turn our attention to a case where the process of delegation breaks down, revealing the usually invisible work needed to sustain ''seamless'' integration. As these cases show, delegation is complex, fragile, and central to the nature of contemporary organizing. Specifically, delegation: 1) reconfigures the organization of work; 2) transforms how outcomes are accomplished; 3) redistributes responsibility for organizational decision-making; and 4) shifts the visibility and invisibility of both actors and their work.",WOS:000317449600001,INFORMATION AND ORGANIZATION

Quantitative indices were developed to calculate within-assessor reproducibility and attribute stability. Across several studies ( n  ∼ 200), it was found that consumers are able to reproduce their sensory product characterizations. Relative to the index proposed by Campo et al. [Australian Journal of Grape and Wine Research 14 (2008) 104–115], the new global within-assessor reproducibility index is proposed as more appropriate for CATA applications that does not limit the number of terms that can be ticked as applicable and when all the terms are applicable to the product category. Heterogeneity was uncovered in within-assessor reproducibility. It was also found that product characterizations elicited by consumers were stable. There was evidence of stability in attribute use being dependent on the nature of the attribute, suggesting that the list of terms included in CATA questions is of considerable importance, and should be carefully selected. The empirical work was done in two countries and across multiple product categories, adding robustness to the findings.",WOS:000320825100006,FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE

METHODS: A sample of individuals aged above 20 years, of both genders, living in Sao Paulo, was used for the validation study (n = 77) and reproducibility study (n = 74) of the food frequency questionnaire. To verify the validity and reproducibility of energy and 19 nutrients were applied two food frequency questionnaires (60 items) and three 24-hour dietary recalls (24HR - reference method). The validity was verified by Spearman correlation coefficient (crude and de-attenuated) and weighted Kappa, and reproducibility by intraclass correlation coefficients and weighted kappa. RESULTS: In analyzes of validity de-attenuated correlation coefficients ranged from 0.21 (carbohydrate) to 0.74 (energy), and weighted kappa exceeded 0.40 for 30% of the nutrients. Polyunsaturated fat and folate did not show significant correlation and weighted kappa. In reproducibility correlation coefficients ranged from 0.36 (polyunsaturated fat) to 0.69 (calcium), and weighted kappa exceeded 0.40 for 80% of the nutrients. CONCLUSION: The food frequency questionnaire analyzed has good validity and reproducibility for estimating the food consumption of adults in Sao Paulo compared to the reference method, so it is an appropriate instrument to be used in epidemiological studies on similar populations. Estimates of polyunsaturated fat and folate should be interpreted with caution.","",""

Our premise in this paper is that MSE projects require integrated information management at their inception. Such efforts will lead to improved communication and sharing of knowledge among diverse project participants, better science outcomes, and more transparent and accessible (ie “open”) science. We encourage researchers to “complete the data life cycle” by publishing well-documented datasets, thereby facilitating re-use of the data to answer new and different questions from the ones conceived by those involved in the original projects. The practice of documenting and submitting datasets to data repositories that are publicly accessible ensures that research results and data are available to and use-able by other researchers, thus fostering open science. However, ecologists are often unfamiliar with the requirements and information management tools for effectively preserving data and receive little institutional or professional incentive to do so. Here, we provide recommendations for achieving these ends and give examples from current MSE projects to demonstrate why information management is critical for ensuring that scientific results can be reproduced and that data can be shared for future use.",WOS:000335370600004,FRONTIERS IN ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT

The purpose of this paper is to systematically review this body of investigative work, with a particular emphasis on life sciences. Based on the systematic analysis and synthesis of 135 articles published between 1980 and 2014, we discuss the most interesting findings for each of the six identified principal academic-industry research topics: involvement predictors and motivators, role of incentives, institutional performance determinants, knowledge transfer institutionalization, relationship with scientific output and impact on open science. Whereas many studies reach consensus regarding the particular personal and contextual predictors of researchers’ knowledge transfer involvement, we also find substantial evidence that depending on empirical setting, variables such as scientific productivity and institutional technology transfer support policies can act both as enablers and inhibitors in the process. We find no straightforward evidence regarding the role of the size, age and structure of technology transfer offices in the knowledge transfer performance of academic institutions. We also show that most studies agree that engagement in knowledge transfer activities does not negatively affect the researchers’ scientific output. Yet, it is less clear to what extent university-industry interactions can be detrimental for the norms of open science.

We propose an operational definition of behavioural addiction together with a number of exclusion criteria, to avoid pathologizing common behaviours and provide a common ground for further research.

Surgical treatment is mainly based on radiographic evaluation of the anatomical alterations. Several classification systems have been described in the published English scientific literature, but the French Cochin classification has not been used very much. Its primary advantage lies in its ability to intricately describe the DDH alterations with a large number of grades. We hypothesized that the inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of the SOFCOT-modified Cochin classification system was equal to that of the Crowe and Hartofilakidis classifications. Material and methods Five French orthopaedic surgeons who were DDH experts classified 94 A/P pelvis radiographs (179 hips) using the Crowe (Cr), Hartofilikadis (Ha) and modified Cochin (Co) systems. This evaluation was repeated a second time one month later. The intra-observer reproducibility was determined with weighted Kappa and concordance coefficients. The inter-observer reproducibility was performed by calculating the multirater Kappa coefficient on each of the two data series. Results For the intra-observer reliability, the average weighed concordance coefficients (95% CI) were 88.62–94.52 for Cr, 89.43–93.80 for Ha and 92.14–95.71 for Co. The average weighed Kappa coefficients (95% CI) were 0.70–0.85 for Cr, 0.67–0.82 for Ha and 0.75–0.83 for Co. For the inter-observer reliability, the Kappa for each assessment round was 0.57 and 0.48 for Cr, 0.43 and 0.44 for Ha, and 0.43 and 0.37 for Co. Discussion The intra- and inter-observer reliability for the modified Cochin classification system is the same as the one for the Crowe and Hartofilakidis classifications. The theoretical advantage of this classification system should be confirmed by comparing the findings with intra-operative anatomical observations.

When the knee is evaluated with the patient standing and actively participating in the movement, the results will differ than when the knee is passively moved through its range-of-motion by the surgeon. If a precise measurement system was available, it could provide additional information to the clinician during this evaluation. Hypothesis The goal of this study was to verify the reproducibility of a fast, flexible optical measurement system to measure rotational knee laxity during weight-bearing. Material and methods Two passive reflective targets were placed on the legs of 11 subjects to monitor femur and tibia displacements in three dimensions. Subjects performed internal and external rotation movements with the knee extended or flexed 30°. During each movement, seven variables were measured: internal rotation, external rotation and overall laxity in extension and 30° flexion, along with neutral rotation value in 30° flexion. Measurement accuracy was also assessed and the right and left knees were compared. Reproducibility was assessed over two measurements sessions. Results The calculated intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for reproducibility was above 0.9 for five of the seven variables measured. The calculated ICC for the right/left comparison was above 0.75 for five of the seven variables measured. Discussion These results confirmed that the proposed system provides reproducible measurements. Our right/left comparison results were consistent with the published literature. This system is fast, reproducible and flexible, which makes it suitable for assessing various weight-bearing movements during clinical evaluations.

This study was designed to evaluate the reproducibility of natural head position over time in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes of space with 3-dimensional imaging. Methods Three-dimensional photographs were taken of 28 adult volunteers (ages, 18-40 years) in natural head position at 5 times: baseline, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours, and 1 week. Using the true vertical and horizontal laser lines projected in an iCAT cone-beam computed tomography machine (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa) for orientation, we recorded references for natural head position on the patient's face with semipermanent markers. By using a 3-dimensional camera system, photographs were taken at each time point to capture the orientation of the reference points. By superimposing each of the 5 photographs on stable anatomic surfaces, changes in the position of the markers were recorded and assessed for parallelism by using 3dMDvultus (3dMD, Atlanta, Ga) and software (Dolphin Imaging & Management Solutions, Chatsworth, Calif). Results No statistically significant differences were observed between the 5 time points in any of the 3 planes of space. However, a statistically significant difference was observed between the mean angular deviations of 3 reference planes, with a hierarchy of natural head position reproducibility established as coronal > axial > sagittal. Conclusions Within the parameters of this study, natural head position was found to be reproducible in the sagittal, coronal, and axial planes of space. The coronal plane had the least variation over time, followed by the axial and sagittal planes.",WOS:000318065300019,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

In this study, the misregistration between the original and a second scan was calculated in the case of both manual positioning and automatic positioning. These calculations were carried out both for a healthy volunteer scanned repeatedly and, in a retrospective study, for 225 patients who had an original and at least one follow-up scan. The effects of the scan operator being the same for both scans or being different were also examined. A commercially available 1.5 Tesla MRI system and a six-element head-array coil were employed in all of the imaging. The reproducibility of the scan prescription was determined by the registration of the original scan image to the follow-up scan image by use of the Fourier phase correlation method. Our results showed that (1) the reproducibility by automatic positioning was superior to that by manual positioning (p 0.05). We conclude that, in follow-up brain MRI, automatic positioning should be used, because manual positioning decreases the reproducibility of the scan prescription even if the same operator performs the second scan.",WOS:000219411300017,RADIOLOGICAL PHYSICS AND TECHNOLOGY

In the past studies of other research groups which focused on the reproducibility of 1D-permeability measurements showed high standard deviations of the gained permeabil- ity values (25%), even though a defined test rig with required specifications was used. Within this study, the reproducibility of capacitive in-plane permeability testing system measurements was benchmarked by comparing results of two research sites using this technology. The reproducibility was compared by using a glass fibre woven textile and carbon fibre non crimped fabric (NCF). These two material types were taken into consideration due to the different electrical properties of glass and carbon with respect to dielectric capacitive sensors of the permeability measurement systems. In order to deter- mine the unsaturated permeability characteristics as function of fibre volume content the measurements were executed at three different fibre volume contents including five repetitions. It was found that the stability and reproducibility of the pre- sented in-plane permeability measurement system is very good in the case of the glass fibre woven textiles. This is true for the comparison of the repetition measurements as well as for the comparison between the two different permeameters. These positive results were confirmed by a comparison to permeability values of the same textile gained with an older gen- eration permeameter applying the same measurement technology. Also it was shown, that a correct determination of the grammage and the material density are crucial for correct correlation of measured permeability values and fibre volume contents.",WOS:000345863300006,EXPRESS POLYMER LETTERS

Yet these cutting-edge statistical analyses often rely on data of questionable origin, varying accuracy, and weak comparability, which seem to have reduced the reproducibility of studies. It is time to improve the transparency of comparative data while also making these improved data more widely available. We, the authors, met to discuss how transparency, usability, and reproducibility of comparative data can best be achieved. We propose four guiding principles: 1) data identification with explicit operational definitions and complete descriptions of methods; 2) inclusion of metadata that capture key characteristics of the data, such as sample size, geographic coordinates, and nutrient availability (for example, captive versus wild animals); 3) documentation of the original reference for each datum; and 4) facilitation of effective interactions with the data via user friendly and transparent interfaces. We urge reviewers, editors, publishers, database developers and users, funding agencies, researchers publishing their primary data, and those performing comparative analyses to embrace these standards to increase the transparency, usability, and reproducibility of comparative studies.",WOS:000386039300004,EVOLUTIONARY ANTHROPOLOGY

This is a review of literature, describing the evolution of open access, recent trend and its growth and adoption at global level. Findings of this study are the philosophy of open access has tremendously grown in all over the globe since 2002 and the benefits have leaded the researchers to alter their practices of scholarly communication. Even the research funders and institutions have mandated open access for the dissemination of research findings for which they grant financial assistance. Limited literature regarding open access status in Sri Lanka indicates that there is room for improvement. This paper proposes the Sri Lankan scientists, to adopt open access for scholarly communication practices to maximize visibility and to earn high impact for their research. Similarly, funding agencies, universities and research institutions can formulate open access policy, establish institutional repositories, and motivate publishing in open access journals and archiving in digital repositories for future development and research. Also, this will help librarians to make a strategic decision to develop open science. This study recommends the researchers in Sri Lanka to do an explorative study to identify the local scenario.

Indeed, given these physical sources, it is then also possible to create further virtual sources that integrate, aggregate or summarise the data from the original sources. As a result, there is a plethora of data sources, from which a small subset may be able to provide the information required to support a task. The number and rate of change in the available sources is likely to make manual source selection and curation by experts impractical for many applications, leading to the need to pursue a pay-as-you-go approach, in which crowds or data consumers annotate results based on their correctness or suitability, with the resulting annotations used to inform, e.g., source selection algorithms. However, for pay-as-you-go feedback collection to be cost-effective, it may be necessary to select judiciously the data items on which feedback is to be obtained. This paper describes OLBP (Ordering and Labelling By Precision), a heuristics-based approach to the targeting of data items for feedback to support mapping and source selection tasks, where users express their preferences in terms of the trade-off between precision and recall. The proposed approach is then evaluated on two different scenarios, mapping selection with synthetic data, and source selection with real data produced by web data extraction. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the amount of feedback required to reach user-provided objectives when using OLBP.","",""

The OA-1000 (Tomey, Japan) is a new optical biometer, which measures axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD), and central corneal thickness (CT) utilizing optical interference technology. The aim of this study was to prove the reproducibility which is considered fundamental for other clinical investigations. Methods. 55 healthy volunteers were enrolled in this study. For each measurement of AL, ACD, and CT the biometer is grabbing a sequence of 10 shots and mean value (mean) and standard deviation (SD) are displayed. Five consecutive measurements were performed and average and standard deviation were assessed. Cronbach’s was derived as a quality measure for reproducibility. Results. For AL measurement Cronbach’s was 1.000, for CT 0.999, and for ACD 0.979, respectively. Mean value for AL was  mm, for ACD it was  mm, and for CT it was  μm, respectively. Standard deviation for AL was  mm, for ACD  mm, and for CT  μm. One correlation was found between mean values for AL and ACD (, ); no other correlations were found between mean values or values of standard deviation of AL, ACD, or CT. Conclusion. The OA-1000 shows an excellent reproducibility for measurement of AL, ACD, and CT and can be used in clinical practice.",WOS:000334860900001,BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL

Together these create a very useful standard for reviewers, program committees, and journal editors; work in information retrieval (IR) increasingly cannot be published unless it has been evaluated using a well-constructed test collection and shown to produce a statistically significant improvement over a good baseline. But, as the saying goes, any tool sharp enough to be useful is also sharp enough to be dangerous. Statistical tests of significance are widely misunderstood. Most researchers and developers treat them as a \"black box\": evaluation results go in and a p-value comes out. But because significance is such an important factor in determining what research directions to explore and what is published, using p-values obtained without thought can have consequences for everyone doing research in IR. Ioannidis has argued that the main consequence in the biomedical sciences is that most published research findings are false; could that be the case in IR as well?","",""

Because body proportions in childhood are different to those in adulthood, children have a relatively higher centre of mass location. This biomechanical difference and the fact that children’s movements have not yet fully matured result in different sway performances in children and adults. When assessing static balance, it is essential to use objective, sensitive tools, and these types of measurement have previously been performed in laboratory settings. However, the emergence of technologies like the Nintendo Wii Board (NWB) might allow balance assessment in field settings.

Several leading research and engineering groups participated in this effort that was funded by the US National Institutes of Health through a variety of infrastructure grants. This effort transformed 3D Slicer from an internal, Boston-based, academic research software application into a professionally maintained, robust, open source platform with an international leadership and developer and user communities. Critical improvements to the widely used underlying open source libraries and tools—VTK, ITK, CMake, CDash, DCMTK—were an additional consequence of this effort. This project has contributed to close to a thousand peer-reviewed publications and a growing portfolio of US and international funded efforts expanding the use of these tools in new medical computing applications every year. In this editorial, we discuss what we believe are gaps in the way medical image computing is pursued today; how a well-executed research platform can enable discovery, innovation and reproducible science (“Open Science”); and how our quest to build such a software platform has evolved into a productive and rewarding social engineering exercise in building an open-access community with a shared vision.",WOS:000382418300032,MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS

Recent studies have cast doubt on that assumption, which is a central tenet of scientific method, even for research that is published in high-impact journals and uses state-of-the-art methodology. Ironically, endodontic research, like most biomedical research, is moving toward highly sophisticated procedures such as gene arrays and proteomics, which are often plagued by false positives and false negatives. This “reproducibility crisis” is thought to arise from many sources including poorly described methodology, inappropriate statistical analysis, the positive bias for article acceptance by journals, the lack of incentives to repeat experiments, and the hypercompetitive research environment that pressures investigators to publish quickly in impact journals. This article outlines the scope of the reproducibility crisis and some of the steps that may be used to ameliorate it. Attention is focused on common statistical errors and pitfalls, the use of confidence intervals in place of the standard Null Hypothesis Statistical Testing (NHST), and the promise of Bayesian statistics in endodontic research.","",""

However, numerical N-body experiments, especially those of planetary systems, are currently not reproducible. In the most optimistic scenario, they can only be replicated in an approximate or statistical sense. Even if authors share their full source code and initial conditions, differences in compilers, libraries, operating systems or hardware often lead to qualitatively different results. 
We provide a new set of easy-to-use, open-source tools that address the above issues, allowing for exact (bit-by-bit) reproducibility of N-body experiments. In addition to generating completely reproducible integrations, we show that our framework also offers novel and innovative ways to analyze these simulations. As an example, we present a high-accuracy integration of the Solar System spanning 10Gyrs, requiring several weeks to run on a modern CPU. In our framework we can not only easily access simulation data at predefined intervals for which we save snapshots, but at any time during the integration. We achieve this by integrating an on-demand reconstructed simulation forward in time from the nearest snapshot. This allows us to extract arbitrary quantities at any point in the saved simulation exactly (bit-by-bit), and within seconds rather than weeks.

The article presents tools, services, and strategies developed by the DAS to support the research community in adequately responding to the legal, ethical, and practical challenges that the transformation towards data-centric, open science presents. These include GESIS’s Secure Data Center, the data publication platform “datorium” and a recent project to create a georeferencing service for survey data. LESSONS LEARNED The experiences gained through these activities show that getting involved—now, rather than further down the road—pays off in that it allows service providers to actively shape the ongoing transformation.

Looking back at recent years in IVC research, tremendous improvements in precision and realism of simulation models concerning all its aspects can be observed. These models offer a vast number of parameters, enabling investigation of a huge variety of different scenarios. We reviewed simulation studies published at major vehicular network conferences from 2009 to 2011 with a key focus on reproducibility and comparability of the published simulation studies. We are glad to present a clear trend toward a consolidated set of established standards, models, and tools. However, looking at individual papers, we commonly find key information (e.g., the used model) missing. This limits both the reproducibility and comparability of simulations conducted.

Research was historically defined as a systematic effort to expand a shared body of knowledge, whereas QA was defined as an effort to ascertain whether a specific project met desired standards. However, the two categories increasingly overlap due to advances in bioinformatics and the shift toward open science. As few ethics review policies take these changes into account, it is often difficult to determine the appropriate level of review. Mislabeling can result in unnecessary burdens for the investigators or, conversely, in underestimation of the risks to participants. Therefore, it is important to develop a consistent method of selecting the review process for genomics and bioinformatics projects. This paper begins by discussing two case studies from the ICGC, followed by a literature review on the distinction between QA and research and a comparative analysis of ethics review policies from Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia. These results are synthesized into a novel two-step decision tool for researchers and policymakers, which uses traditional criteria to sort clearly defined activities while requiring the use of actual risk levels to decide more complex cases.",WOS:000380390300005,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF HUMAN GENETICS

This is an incredibly useful community resource that complements existing efforts like the Genome in a Bottle project by providing a set of validated, difficult regions to evaluate variant detection tools. I appreciate the efforts to make these test sets public; instead of having validation sets like these developed internally at clinical laboratories, we can collaborate and improve them publicly.


In collaboration with Oliver Hofmann at the Wolfson Wohl Cancer Research Center ( https://twitter.com/fiamh) we obtained access to the data and were able to run a validation using bcbio variant calling ( http://bcbio-nextgen.readthedocs.io). In doing this, we tried to address a couple of challenges for other users wanting to make immediate use of this data in their own in hour validation work: 


The truth sets are not easy to plug into existing validation frameworks. Most validation tools like rtg vcfeval and hap.py work from VCF format files, while this truth set is in a custom spreadsheet format with a mixture of methods for describing changes. You can use Platypus positions for many but need to use CSN descriptions or evaluated position for the remainder.


The truth sets don't appear to describe if we expect calls to be homozygous or heterozygous calls at each position.


Many existing validation approaches expect a single (or few) samples so coordinating checking and validation for all these samples can be a challenge.


As part of this review, we generated a set of configuration files and scripts to help make running validations with ICR142 easier ( https://github.com/bcbio/icr142-validation).



This comparison work also includes a set of comparisons with common callers (GATK HaplotypeCaller, FreeBayes and VarDict). Several of the Sanger validated regions without variants are false positives in at least 2 of the callers tested, so this dataset exposes some common issues with calling and filtering. It would be useful to hear the author's experience with validating callers using this benchmark set and if they have additional filters used to avoid these problems. Knowing a baseline expectation for results would help ensure that the users understand how correctly they've setup the validation resources.


We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard.","",""

Another approach to addressing reproducibility are Reproducibility Initiatives (RIs), well-intended, high-profile, systematically peer-vetted initiatives that are intended to replace the traditional process of scientific self-correction. Outcomes from the RIs reported to date have questioned the usefulness of this approach, particularly when the RI outcome differs from other independent self-correction studies that have reproduced the original finding. As a failed RI attempt is a single outcome distinct from the original study, it cannot provide any definitive conclusions necessitating additional studies that the RI approach has neither the ability nor intent of conducting making it a questionable replacement for self-correction. A failed RI attempt also has the potential to damage the reputation of the author of the original finding. Reproduction is frequently confused with replication, an issue that is more than semantic with the former denoting “similarity” and the latter an “exact copy” – an impossible outcome in research because of known and unknown technical, environmental and motivational differences between the original and reproduction studies. To date, the RI framework has negatively impacted efforts to improve reproducibility, confounding attempts to determine whether a research finding is real.",WOS:000406086700002,BIOCHEMICAL PHARMACOLOGY

Sixty-five young adult women were evaluated on two different days by a single rater, with a one-week interval between evaluations. Three consecutive measurements were performed on each day. Regarding repeatability, for all the variables (coordinates, distances and area), the ICC scores were classified as excellent, with low SEM ( 0.6. The adapted IMP needs to be conducted only once. Regarding reproducibility, the variables apt for use are the area within the points and the distance between the trochanters.

The Research Data Alliance (RDA), which is developing an open Internet platform structured much like the World Wide Web, aims to enable greater collaboration among scientists of all disciplines and from all parts of the globe through the use and reuse of data. Its mission, say the founders, is to unlock the innovation potential of research data by encouraging and enabling scientists to publish the data underlying their research results.The move comes amid growing demands in the research community for tools that allow researchers not only to share their data, but also to manage and make use of the huge volumes of data being generated through literally billions of computers, sensors, and other connected devices-a development known as Big Data. The aim, said John Wood, the European Union cochairman of the RDA, speaking in a recent webinar, is to ensure that when scientists seek access to the data of their peers, \"this data is available to them in a format they can use.\"RDA, which was supported in its earlier stages by Europe, the United States, and Australia, faces no shortage of challenges, experts agree. The technical challenges begin with the need for a common framework to assure interoperability. For instance, the various elements of this new scientists' web-the various codes, policies, standards, and practices-need to be harmonized to allow data sharing. And that infrastructure, says Francine Berman, who chairs the RDA in the United States, needs to span not only countries and continents, but also scientific disciplines and industrial sectors-\"anywhere there is interest in data-driven innovation, which is practically everywhere.\"Then there are the various responses to the idea of sharing. Scientists, commercial research interests, and governments are at odds on the issue. A growing number of governments in industrialized nations are demanding open access to research outputs from publicly funded research and development projects. In 2012, for instance, the European Commission committed to the Open Data movement, arguing that information already paid for by taxpayers \"should not be paid for again each time it is accessed or used\" and should benefit European businesses and citizens \"to the full.\"In February, the U.S. government announced a new open-access policy requiring publications from taxpayerfunded research to be made free to read after a year's delay. That policy expands the National Institutes of Health (NIH) approach, which, until now, has applied only to work in the biomedical sciences. The White House move came just a week after FASTR (Fair Access to Science and Technology Research), a bill that would speed release of publicly funded research to just six months and expand the reach of the policy, was introduced in the U.S Congress. Within the EU, the United Kingdom has led the way, declaring that all research funded through the nation's research councils must be made freely and openly available to anyone around the world; the policy went into effect on April 1, 2013.Neelie Kroes, vice president of the European Commission responsible for the Digital Agenda, spoke about the era of open science at a recent forum. \"Only when results and evidence are shared can the community examine and compare, discard, and learn,\" she said. \"There can be no modern science without sharing. We are putting openness at the heart of EU research and innovation funding.\" Farnam Jahanian, director of the Computer and Information Science and Engineering directorate at the U.S. government's National Science Foundation (NSF), shares a similar view. \"We need policies for data sharing and open access,\" he said in March at the RDA launch. \"Data represents unprecedented opportunities to accelerate scientific discovery and innovation.\" In that context, Jahanian pointed to the Obama administration's announced $200 million funding of the Big Data Research and Development Initiative, which aims to advance the technologies needed for effective analysis and use of data and which will work with the RDA. …","",""

In this trend of academic commercialization, a growing concern has been expressed that its potential incompatibility with the traditional norms of open science could undermine the cooperative climate in academia. Drawing on the framework of evolution of the cooperation, this study examines the changing nature of academic cooperation under the current policy trend. In an ideal state of open science, academics are supposed to cooperate gratis and unconditionally. However, results predict that the commercialized regime could compromise underlying mechanisms of cooperation and allow defectors to prevail. As the trend further grows, academics would become more demanding of direct reward in exchange for cooperation, and they would refrain from engaging in cooperation but would prefer to work independently. Some interventions (e.g., centralized rewarding) could mitigate the problem but require delicate system design.",WOS:000354196900007,JOURNAL OF EVOLUTIONARY ECONOMICS

It is possible to establish at least two phases that distinguish epistemological orientations and analytical interests. During the first phas a social science was constructed, the object of which was the economic system and its problems and dynamics. The interdisciplinary nature and substantive vocation of this were notable. In the second phase we witnessed what could be described as a disciplinary regression, with the domination of formalistic analyses. Empirically, through the analysis of three peer-reviewed journals (two economic and one interdisciplinary) and of the projects approved by Portugal's Foundation for Science and Technology (FCT - Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia), we conclude there are several ways forward from the crossroads at which we now find ourselves. One of these is the insistence that economics is a 'science of the markets', which is legitimising and normative.

This paper explores which elements can be considered to characterize the reproducibility of a study in this area, and how they can be analyzed to better understand the type of reproduction studies they enable or obstruct. One of the main results of this exploration is the need of a systematic approach to asses the reproducibility of a study, due to the complexity of the processes usually involved, and the many details to be taken into account. To address this need, a methodology for assessing the reproducibility of studies is also presented and discussed, as a tool to help to raise awareness about research reproducibility in this field. The application of the methodology in practice has shown how, even for papers aimed to be reproducible, a systematic analysis raises important aspects that render reproduction difficult or impossible. We also show how, by identifying elements and attributes related to reproducibility, it can be better understood which kind of reproduction can be done for a specific study, given the description of datasets, methodologies and parameters it uses.",WOS:000300343600006,EMPIRICAL SOFTWARE ENGINEERING

The aim of this white paper is to provide a framework for integrating computational proteomics into ELIXIR in the near future, and thus to broaden the portfolio of omics technologies supported by this European distributed infrastructure. This white paper is the direct result of a strategy meeting on 'The Future of Proteomics in ELIXIR' that took place in March 2017 in Tubingen (Germany), and involved representatives of eleven ELIXIR nodes. These discussions led to a list of priority areas in computational proteomics that would complement existing activities and close gaps in the portfolio of tools and services offered by ELIXIR so far. We provide some suggestions on how these activities could be integrated into ELIXIR's existing platforms, and how it could lead to a new ELIXIR use case in proteomics. We also highlight connections to the related field of metabolomics, where similar activities are ongoing. This white paper could thus serve as a starting point for the integration of computational proteomics into ELIXIR. Over the next few months we will be working closely with all stakeholders involved, and in particular with other representatives of the proteomics community, to further refine this paper.

Two observers carried out the measurements of facial ST thickness of 20 adult subjects using CBCT scan data, and inter- and intra-observer reproducibilities were evaluated. The measurement method of “perpendicular to bone” resulted in high inter- and intra-observer reproducibility at all 32 landmarks. In contrast, the “perpendicular to skin” method and “direct” method, which measures a distance between one point on bone and the other point on skin, presented low reproducibility. The results indicate that reproducibility could be increased by identifying the landmarks on hard tissue images, rather than on ST images, and the landmark description used in this study can be used in the establishment of reliable tissue depth data using CBCT images.",WOS:000359262900016,JOURNAL OF FORENSIC SCIENCES

The explicit parallel programming paradigm makes the parallel programs closely coupled with the platform at the time of programming. It is also responsible for growing application instabilities making reproducibility impossible in extreme scales. This impossibility is also linked to our inability to quantify application scalability. An implicit parallel paradigm is proposed to rectify these problems.","",""

This problem is exacerbated, as firms increasingly develop their innovations or operate in countries with weak IPR institutional environments. But how does IPR uncertainty affect firms’ strategy toward knowledge appropriation — capturing of economic value from their knowledge assets — and toward providing access to these knowledge assets? Drawing on research from the economics of science and intellectual property strategy, we examine this question using a novel panel data covering 362 firms and organizations in the knowledge-intensive genomics industry based on all genomics patents and matching papers from 1988 to 2005. We find that under uncertain IPR conditions, firms reveal and accumulate more knowledge through open science (follow-on publishing) but shift to knowledge appropriation through commercial science (follow-on patenting) when IPR uncertainty is narrowed. This effect is most salient when firms develop their knowledge assets or operate under strong IPR institutional regime. For highly science-based knowledge assets, firms continue tapping into open science for access and reciprocity in knowledge acquisition from the scientific community. These findings highlight the role of patent grant as a potential lever to shape firms’ knowledge processes and long-term innovative capacity, and the emergence of a concerted “science strategy” employed by firms.",WOS:000397116700003,INDUSTRIAL AND CORPORATE CHANGE

To this end, a simulation-based exploratory study is conducted to better understand the conditions that confer increased rates of innovation in such socio-technical systems. Three types of open science communities are identified and simulated using agent simulation as a method of inquiry. Simulation results show that centrality, as a measure of degree of connectedness, correlates with innovation output in exploratory and service communities up to a point.

[Methods] The time taken to walk 50 m, the time taken to walk each 10-m section (laps 1–5), the time taken to walk 10 m, and grip strength were measured. In addition, the functional reach test (FRT), one-leg standing test, and timed up and go (TUG) test were performed. [Results] In a reproducibility analysis, the interclass correlation coefficient (1,1) was 0.97. In a Bland-Altman analysis, no systematic error was found. The measured values from the 50-m walking test included a measurement error of 1.5 s, and the acceptable margin of error was confirmed to be 3.1 s. In a validity analysis, the 50-m walking test score was significantly correlated with the 10-m walking and TUG test scores.

Although several high impact factor journals have acknowledged their past failure to scrutinise adequately the technical soundness of manuscripts, there is a perplexing reluctance to implement basic corrective measures. The reverse transcription real time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) is probably the most straightforward measurement technique available for RNA quantification and is widely used in research, diagnostic, forensic and biotechnology applications. Despite the impact of the minimum information for the publication of quantitative PCR experiments (MIQE) guidelines, which aim to improve the robustness and the transparency of reporting of RT-qPCR data, we demonstrate that elementary protocol errors, inappropriate data analysis and inadequate reporting continue to be rife and conclude that the majority of published RT-qPCR data are likely to represent technical noise.

This preliminary study aimed to evaluate the observer’s reproducibility of CMR-FT in a small animal (mouse) model and define sample size calculation for future trials. Six C57BL/6 J mice were selected from the ongoing experimental mouse model onsite and underwent CMR with a 3 Tesla small animal MRI scanner. Myocardial deformation was analyzed using dedicated software (TomTec, Germany) by two observers. Left ventricular (LV) longitudinal, circumferential and radial strain (EllLAX, EccSAX and ErrSAX) were calculated. To assess intra-observer agreement data analysis was repeated after 4 weeks. The sample size required to detect a relative change in strain was calculated. In general, EccSAX and EllLAX demonstrated highest inter-observer reproducibility (ICC 0.79 (0.46–0.91) and 0.73 (0.56–0.83) EccSAX and EllLAX respectively). In contrast, at the intra-observer level EllLAX was more reproducible than EccSAX (ICC 0.83 (0.73–0.90) and 0.74 (0.49–0.87) EllLAX and EccSAX respectively). The reproducibility of ErrSAX was weak at both observer levels. Preliminary sample size calculation showed that a small study sample (e.g. ten animals to detect a relative 10% change in EccSAX) could be sufficient to detect changes if parameter variability is low. This pilot study demonstrates good to excellent inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of CMR-FT technique in small animal model. The most reproducible measures are global circumferential and global longitudinal strain, whereas reproducibility of radial strain is weak. Furthermore, sample size calculation demonstrates that a small number of animals could be sufficient for future trials.",WOS:000408736900001,BMC MEDICAL IMAGING

We consider their comments to be helpful to readers because they broaden the discussion on the proper statistical approach to be used to validate accuracy. In brief, Sabour and Kermani caution not to confuse the assessment of validity (i.e. accuracy) with reliability (i.e. repeatability or reproducibility). We share their concern and have likewise mentioned elsewhere3 that many studies evaluating imaging accuracy suffer from unsuitable statistical evaluations. Thus, we took care to address the questions of validity and reliability in our article separately, each with an appropriate statistical approach.

We are, however, surprised at Sabour and Kermani’s comment on the assessment of accuracy. In their letter, they suggest sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, likelihood ratios and odds ratio as tests to evaluate the validity (accuracy) of a method compared with a gold standard. Although inherently correct for categorical data, these comments fail to be relevant to our study, because all these analyses are inapplicable for continuous values such as linear measurements.

So, what would be the best way to evaluate the validity of linear measurements? When trying to assess the degree of agreement, the correct statistical approach is not obvious. To identify whether two methods of measurement are interchangeable, we need to know by how much one method is likely to differ from the other.4 The simplest and most popular approach5 is the Bland–Altman method,6 consisting of plotting the difference between the two measurements against the mean of the two measurements and establishing the limits of agreement (LOA).7 Provided the assumptions of uniform mean and standard deviation are met, the Bland–Altman plot with its LOA can be carried out by anyone with basic statistical knowledge, offering results that are easy to interpret in a meaningful way.8

Sabour and Kermani charge us by writing that “the common practice for assessing validity (accuracy) is to apply well-known statistical tests, and it is unclear why the authors did not consider employing such practice.” The original publication of Bland and Altman6 has by now been cited well over 25 000 times. We wonder how much more well known a method could be?",WOS:000317810500013,DENTOMAXILLOFACIAL RADIOLOGY

A careful review of the literature showed potential methodologic errors that might influence the high reported reproducibility of the CVM method, and we recently established that the reproducibility of the CVM method was poor when these potential errors were eliminated. The purpose of this study was to further investigate the reproducibility of the individual vertebral patterns. In other words, the purpose was to determine which of the individual CVM vertebral patterns could be classified reliably and which could not. Methods Ten practicing orthodontists, trained in the CVM method, evaluated the morphology of cervical vertebrae C2 through C4 from 30 cephalometric radiographs using questions based on the CVM method. The Fleiss kappa statistic was used to assess interobserver agreement when evaluating each cervical vertebrae morphology question for each subject. The Kendall coefficient of concordance was used to assess the level of interobserver agreement when determining a “derived CVM stage” for each subject. Results Interobserver agreement was high for assessment of the lower borders of C2, C3, and C4 that were either flat or curved in the CVM method, but interobserver agreement was low for assessment of the vertebral bodies of C3 and C4 when they were either trapezoidal, rectangular horizontal, square, or rectangular vertical; this led to the overall poor reproducibility of the CVM method. These findings were reflected in the Fleiss kappa statistic. Furthermore, nearly 30% of the time, individual morphologic criteria could not be combined to generate a final CVM stage because of incompatible responses to the 5 questions. Intraobserver agreement in this study was only 62%, on average, when the inconclusive stagings were excluded as disagreements. Intraobserver agreement was worse (44%) when the inconclusive stagings were included as disagreements. For the group of subjects that could be assigned a CVM stage, the level of interobserver agreement as measured by the Kendall coefficient of concordance was only 0.45, indicating moderate agreement. Conclusions The weakness of the CVM method results, in part, from difficulty in classifying the vertebral bodies of C3 and C4 as trapezoidal, rectangular horizontal, square, or rectangular vertical. This led to the overall poor reproducibility of the CVM method and our inability to support its use as a strict clinical guideline for the timing of orthodontic treatment.",WOS:000293273100022,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

What this means in practice is that tools released under OSI-compliant licenses cannot use the “for non-commercial use only” disclaimers. A common worry [9] is that this affects whether the tool can be commercialized:

Do open source licenses stop me from commercializing my code?

No – no matter which open source license is used.

Do open source licenses mean that others can commercialize my code?

By definition, the open source code can be commercialized by anyone: the code’s author, their institution, an independent commercial entity, a private person. Literally anyone. This is independent of the exact OSI-compliant license used.

How do I choose a license?

The good folks of Github came to the rescue and created the ‘Choose an open source license’ service [10] for this. You can also browse for an appropriate license on the Open Source Initiative website [8]. Although some users believe that open source code should never be released under licenses that are “copyleft” [11] (these are the licenses which require that any derivative of the code is released under the same license), an equally good argument can be made [12] for GPL license-compatible licenses (which often are “copyleft”). While the use of permissive licenses that are not “copyleft” is more in the spirit of open science, Genome Biology currently accepts all OSI-compliant licenses.

How do I go about licensing my source code from the legal point of view?

Only the owner of the intellectual property rights to the source code can license it. While Genome Biology requires that the source code is released under an OSI-compliant license, it is the authors’ responsibility to ensure that they are within their rights to use such a license in the first place. Morin and colleagues provide a handy guide for the authors on what to do before you release your code under any license [13].",WOS:000381721600001,GENOME BIOLOGY

Developing a Methodology for Evaluating Users’ Perspective of the OA Journal JeDEM,0,"Watch the VIDEO of the presentation. JeDEM, the Journal of E-democracy and Open Government (jedem.org), was first published in 2009 as an initiative of the Centre for E-Governance. It is an open access e-journal (that follows the green open access road) with a focus on topics such as e-democracy, e-participation, open government and open access. The journal follows the green open access road, and it is indexed with EBSCO [1] , DOAJ [2] , Google Scholar and the Public Knowledge Project metadata harvester [3] . With a wide range of subjects and research fields, articles cover diverse topics so publishing in JeDEM attracts a wide range of authors and readers from different disciplines. While the effects and impact of open access publishing have been studied, there is less research on the motivational factors of publishing in open access e-journals (such as JeDEM) that focus on a user perspective (see e.g. Nicholas et al 2015; Jamali, Nicholas, and Herman 2016). A review of JeDEM by Quality Open Access Market (QOAM) [4] in 2016 provides an external evaluation of JeDEM, but in this contribution, we wish to present and to discuss a research design to assess the users’ perspectives and motivational factors for publishing open access whilst also considering different user types and disciplines. A workshop held at CEDEM16 (Conference for E-Democracy and Open Government 2016 [5] , see Lampoltshammer, Edelmann, und Schossboeck, 2016)), shed some light on the most important topics for researchers in open access publishing. The results of this workshop revealed some motivations for publishing open access. Another workshop will be held at CeDEM Asia 2016 (Conference for E-Democracy and Open Government Asia 2016) [6] , with the aim of uncovering further motivational factors and understanding them from a comparative perspective. Comparing the results of both workshops and a literature review regarding motivational factors for open access publishing will form the basis for developing and choosing the questions for a quantitative study (online survey) to be sent out to all users of JeDEM by summer 2017. Conferences in the area of open access will be used to discuss the methodology and set-up of this questionnaire. Registered and potential users will be encouraged to answer the survey, also to find out about their use of the features of the journal (e.g. commenting articles) and how such features contribute to the concept of open science and scholarly communication. By assessing the user perspective of our open access journal, we seek to answer questions such as: Can we distinguish differences in motivation for publishing in open access across user types and disciplines? What differences can be determined? How can users be classified according to their motivations and does it make sense to consider user types and motivations for management activities of an open access journal? What type of users are JeDEM users? What are users’ opinion on different aspects of open access publishing and its further development, e.g. open peer review etc. and how do user opinions differ across the disciplines or countries? How can results help other e-publishers or editors in the area of open access and contribute to the field of scholarly communication? As an ongoing research project, we will be looking forward for feedback and recommendations about how to develop the user survey and our activities for the journal.

Concerns about a lack of reproducibility of statistically significant results have recently been raised in many fields, and it has been argued that this lack comes at substantial economic costs. We here report the results from prediction markets set up to quantify the reproducibility of 44 studies published in prominent psychology journals and replicated in the Reproducibility Project: Psychology. The prediction markets predict the outcomes of the replications well and outperform a survey of market participants’ individual forecasts. This shows that prediction markets are a promising tool for assessing the reproducibility of published scientific results. The prediction markets also allow us to estimate probabilities for the hypotheses being true at different testing stages, which provides valuable information regarding the temporal dynamics of scientific discovery. We find that the hypotheses being tested in psychology typically have low prior probabilities of being true (median, 9%) and that a “statistically significant” finding needs to be confirmed in a well-powered replication to have a high probability of being true. We argue that prediction markets could be used to obtain speedy information about reproducibility at low cost and could potentially even be used to determine which studies to replicate to optimally allocate limited resources into replications.",WOS:000366404200048,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

This study found that whilst most academics support the principle of making knowledge freely available to everyone, the use of OA publishing among UK academics was still limited despite relevant established OA policies. The results suggest that there were differences in the extent of OA practice between different universities, academic disciplines, age and seniorities.

In the US jurisdiction the
Daubert decision2 has defined several criteria that might be assessed if a testimony is challenged. In particular
the potential for testing or actual testing, as well as known or potential error rate are two very important
criteria. In order to be able to compare the results with each other, the reproducible creation of evaluation
samples is necessary. However, each latent fingerprint is unique due to external inuence factors such as sweat
composition or pressure during the application of a trace. Hence, Schwarz1 introduces a method to print latent
fingerprints using ink jet printers equipped with artificial sweat. In this paper we assess the image quality in
terms of reproducibility and clarity of the printed artificial sweat patterns. For that, we determine the intra class
variance from one printer on the same and on different substrates based on a subjective assessment, as well as
the inter class variance between different printers of the same model using pattern recognition techniques. Our
results indicate that the intra class variance is primarily inuenced by the drying behavior of the amino acid.
The inter class is surprisingly large between identical models of one printer. Our evaluation is performed using
100 samples on an overhead foil and 50 samples on a compact disk surface with 5 different patterns (two line
structures, a fingerprint image and two di_erent arrows with a larger area with amino acid) acquired with a
Keyence VK-X110 laser scanning confocal microscope.11 The results show a significant difference between the

The potential biases in the chosen articles (country of origin, inventor involved in study, methodological quality) were systematically analyzed and the revisions per 100 observed component years (Revp100OCY) index was calculated. For a given implant, a differential factor greater than 3 between the Revp100OCY index for published series and the one from registers was considered as indicative of a potential selection (inventor) or publication (conflict of interest) bias. Although initially performed on English publications, this methodology was subsequently applied to French publications in the field of total hip arthroplasty (THA). Material and methods French publications indexed in Medline ( Rev Chir Orthop and Orthop Trauma Surg Res since 2009) were analyzed. These studies involved implants designed in France (ABG™, Corail™ stem, Cerafit™/Osteal™, Bousquet) or that were used worldwide (Omnifit™ stem, Alloclassic™ and Charnley-type or Muller-type implants). The articles or abstracts selected had to contain sufficient information (number of revisions, number of cases and/or revisions, average follow-up) to allow the Revp100OCY index to be calculated. Results Overall, the average Revp100OCY index for THA series published in French was 0.76, which is consistent with the worldwide average of 1.29. For the ABG™ System, the Revp100OCY index was 1.5, which was higher than register data (0.77). Cemented Charnley-type stems had a Revp100OCY index of 1.68 (register 0.64) and low friction arthroplasty type THA had a Revp100OCY index of 0.59 (register 0.33). The Revp100OCY index was slightly lower relative to register data for the Muller THA (0.22 versus 0.33), Corail™ stem (0.1 versus 0.24), Omnifit™ (0.26 versus 0.37) and Alloclassic™ (0.21 versus 0.49). Other implants without comparable register data had a relatively high Revp100OCY index: 1.2 for the Bousquet dual mobility cup and 1.35 for the Osteal™/Cerafit™ hybrid system. Conclusions The few studies published in French include only a limited number of cases, but their follow-up is long and the revision rate consistent with register data. There is no indication of any type of bias in French scientific publications relative to the reproducibility of THA results.",WOS:000318334200001,ORTHOPAEDICS & TRAUMATOLOGY-SURGERY & RESEARCH

Millennia later, we do not know whether he was a soldier or a courier, or whether he really ran the entire 240 km from Athens to Sparta and then back from Marathon to Athens. What is clear however, is that his death went down in history as the first documented exercise-related death and provides a tangible starting-point for the discipline of sport cardiology.

Well, I did not start on day one, but Ruth Nussinov has been the Deputy Editor-in-Chief since October 2008, and she is an outstanding scientist and editor ideally suited to take over as editor-in-chief. So please welcome Ruth to this leadership role. The journal is in very safe hands. The journal staff, editors, and Ruth have not seen the last of me, however—this is just too much fun. As Founding Editor-in-Chief, I will continue to be involved with the journal, with a focus on special projects, helping Ruth and the team where I can, and, of course, continue as an author of both research articles and front matter, such as the Ten Simple Rules series.

In changing roles, I would like to make a few personal comments about the evolution of the journal and where it might go next. When Steven Brenner, Michael Eisen, and I founded the journal, we had a vision for how it would fill a gap between journals supporting purely computational methods and the array of experimental journals with the odd, token computational paper [1]. Thanks to you, the readers and authors, that vision has been realized beyond what we imagined, and I am very proud of how the journal is a voice for our broad and important community and at the same time helps build that community. The appearance of the journal in June 2005 was timely since it both propelled our field of science at a time when it was being recognized as a critical part of the life sciences, and made a strong statement about the importance of open access.

I must confess that when we started planning for the journal in 2004, support for open access seemed like the right thing to do, but it was not a major driver for me. That changed when, early on in my tenure, I realized open access is critical to maximizing the rate of scientific discovery. Supporting open access, and the new forms of scholarly communication it fosters, enriched my career and brought me into contact with many amazing people I would not otherwise have met. Emphasizing that enrichment, of the 22 invited lectures I gave in 2011, 18 were evangelizing about the importance of open access and open science, and four were directly related to my science. In my opinion, we have yet to see open access reach its full potential, but we will [2], and our journal will be poised to play an ever-increasing role as an exemplar for what is possible. In short, PLOS and this journal will continue to foster change, which maximizes the accessibility and comprehension of science. I am proud to continue to be a part of that.

It only remains for me to thank and acknowledge a variety of people who have all been so critically important in the past seven years. First and foremost are the approximately 150 editors who have worked tirelessly to shape and ensure a high-quality product over the years. There is no journal without community-driven efforts, which offer limited reward beyond a job well done. I can't mention everyone, but I must call out Karl Friston, who between 2005 and 2010 worked tirelessly to make computational neuroscience such a rich part of the journal, and Steven Brenner, Simon Levin, and Sebastian Bonhoeffer, who, since the journal's inception, have always responded with good advice.

Thanks are also due to Mark Patterson, who, until late 2011, was Director of Publishing at PLOS. Mark was critical to the success of the journal and to PLOS as a whole. We first began talking about the journal in May 2004, and he listened to, refined, and contributed to a lot of crazy ideas that define what the journal is today. To Catherine Nancarrow, who managed the journal from 2005 to 2010. A nicer and more dedicated person will not be found. In the current era of 140 character snapshots, her emails conferred a quality, beauty, and caring that you just don't see anymore. To Evie Browne, who contributed so much as Publications Assistant and Publications Manager between 2006 and 2009. Her spreadsheet analyses of how the journal was doing were amazing. To Andy Collings, who in various roles from Publications Assistant to Editorial Manager from 2005 to 2012 just made all ideas work, however outside the box they were. To Fran Lewitter, who, as Education Editor since the beginning, has created an important community jewel. To Scott Markel, who has been a voice of reason and an interface to the International Society of Computational Biology (ISCB) over the years. Finally, to all the other staff who have contributed over the past seven years: Emily Stevenson, Johanna Dehlinger, Helen Budd, Sheran Basra, and Cecy Marden, and the amazing current staff of Laura Taylor, Clare Weaver, and Chris Hall, all so well led by Rosemary Dickin and Theo Bloom.

PLOS is a family of journals and a family of people; in short, a family organization whose goal is to disseminate science in the most open and useful way possible. It is a successful organization able to recruit the best and most dedicated staff, and to adjust to its growing success and the success of open access itself. The world of scientific publishing will never be the same again because of PLOS and the people who drive it. I am proud to continue to be a member of this amazing family. There is no other publisher like PLOS and no other journal like PLOS Computational Biology.",WOS:000310568800024,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

It reflects the philosophy of PAGES and its community of scientists that the past holds the key to better projections of the future. Climatic and environmental evidence from the past can be used to sharpen future projections of global change, thereby informing political and societal decisions on mitigation and adaptation. Young scientists are critical to the future of this endeavour, which we call 'paleoscience'. Their scientific knowledge, interdisciplinarity, international collaboration, and leadership skills will be required if this field is to continue to thrive. Meanwhile, it is also important to remember that science develops not only by applying new strategies and new tools to make new observations, but also by building upon existing knowledge. Modern research in paleoscience began around fifty years ago, and one could say that the third generation of researchers is now emerging. It is a wise investment to ensure that existing skills and knowledge are transferred to this generation. This will enable them to lead the science towards new accomplishments, and to make important contributions towards the wider field of global change science. Motivated by such considerations, PAGES organized its first Young Scientists Meeting (YSM), held in Corvallis (Oregon, USA) in July 2009 (http://www.pages-osm.org/ysm/index.html). The meeting took place immediately before the much larger 3rd PAGES Open Science Meeting (OSM; http://www.pages-osm.org/osm/index.html). The YSM brought together 91 early-career scientists from 21 different nations. During the two-day meeting, PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, and new faculty met to present their work and build networks across geographical and disciplinary borders. Several experienced and well-recognized researchers tutored this conference, and gave assistance to young scientists by offering advice on publication, promotion, outreach processes, and data management. At the subsequent OSM, the young scientists had the opportunity to present their results to a larger community, and to build networks with their senior colleagues. In a friendly and classroom-like atmosphere, the research presented during the YSM was of a remarkably high quality, and merited publication in this special issue. The 23 short proceedings papers are first-authored by YSM attendees, and based on their presented work and the associated discussions. Consistent with the spirit of the YSM, the core of the guest editor team consisted of YSM early-career scientists, while members of the wider scientific community reviewed the papers. Studies presented in this issue cover a large range of topics. Paleoclimatic and paleoenvironmental research is always seeking new natural archives and improved proxies, and so some papers focus on reconstruction methodologies and the interpretation and calibration of proxies. Other papers present a variety of modeling approaches, such as climate system modeling, forward modeling, or ecosystem modeling. Still others focus on reconstructions from marine (foraminifera, diatoms, corals) or continental (tree rings, speleothems, ice cores) archives, or on understanding the dynamics of the Earth system and the feedbacks between its various components. The studies presented span timescales ranging from the past 200,000 years to the last few decades, and consider changes in natural phenomena such as the hydrological cycle and the El Nino-Southern Oscillation, as well as local- and regional-scale interaction of humans with the environment. The papers presented in this special issue therefore reflect current challenges in paleoscience research: understanding natural variability on both long and short time scales, and monitoring anthropogenic impacts which range from historic landscaping to more recent pollution. The concept and format of the 1st PAGES YSM worked very well, and created a high degree of enthusiasm and stimulation among the participants (as is demonstrated by this special issue). The 2nd YSM is therefore firmly planned to take place in 2013, back-to-back with the 4th PAGES OSM. Crucial and gratefully acknowledged contributions to the success of the YSM were made by the numerous co-sponsors (see logos below), who provided the financial basis for the YSM and supported the attendance of many early-career researchers from various parts of the world. Furthermore, we cordially thank all reviewers for shaping this proceeding issue with their insightful and helpful reviews.","",""

This paper aims to describes the statistical approach adopted by a multi-site laboratory to satisfy these requirements and to routinely check the performance of the methods. A validation protocol was performed, reflecting a great variability of experimental conditions, represented by the period of time during which determinations were made, the different laboratories concerned, the large number of technicians involved, the differences in the level of contamination of the matrix analyzed and the operating conditions (equipment, reagents, culture media, environmental conditions, etc.). Despite the very high variability of the experimental conditions, the values of repeatability and reproducibility obtained for the methods were lower than those stated in the respective regulations. In addition, the top-down approach adopted in this study is to be considered effective overtime and allows to randomize all variable factors, including the effects of sensitivity and specificity, in order to simulate the conditions of real reproducibility. A specific Excel spreadsheet was also developed for the routine expression of analytical results. This spreadsheet represents a very useful tool for operators to calculate and routinely check the results, as well as to assess the uncertainty of measurement.

Yet current study is hampered by the long-known problems of inadequate management of data and insufficient description of analytical procedures, especially in the field of ecology. Despite recent institutional incentives to share data and new data archiving infrastructure, many ecologists do not archive and publish their data and code. Given current rapid rates of global change, the consequences of this are extreme: because an ecological dataset collected at a certain place and time represents an irreproducible set of observations, ecologists doing local, independent research possess, in their file cabinets and spreadsheets, a wealth of information about the natural world and how it is changing. Although large-scale initiatives will increasingly enable and reward open science, we believe that change demands action and personal commitment by individuals – from students and PIs. Herein, we outline the major benefits of sharing data and analytical procedures in the context of global change ecology, and provide guidelines for overcoming common obstacles and concerns. If individual scientists and laboratories can embrace a culture of archiving and sharing we can accelerate the pace of the scientific method and redefine how local science can most robustly scale up to globally relevant questions.",WOS:000304820300002,GLOBAL CHANGE BIOLOGY

Then it was believed by many that long range acoustic signal transmissions in the ocean were not reproducible or stable.

Setting Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University, Zhejiang, China. Design Observational cross-sectional study. Methods Two observers took 3 consecutive measurements in healthy right eyes using each device to assess intraoperator repeatability. The mean values obtained at different sessions by the first operator were used to determine the intersession reproducibility. Three consecutive measurements obtained by the first operator at the first session were averaged and used to assess agreement. Results The ACD measurements obtained by 2 observers in 71 eyes were highly repeatable using the 4 devices, with a test–retest repeatability of 0.04 to 0.07 mm for intraoperator repeatability. The interoperator and intersession reproducibility of ACD measurements were high, and the test–retest repeatability ranges of interoperator and intersession reproducibility were 0.06 to 0.07 mm and 0.05 to 0.08 mm, respectively. The ACD measurements of the 4 systems were sorted from the thickest to the thinnest (Galilei G2 > Visante > Sirius > Pentacam). The differences in the measurements were statistically significant except between the ACD measurements obtained by the Sirius device and the Visante device. However, good agreement with narrow 95% limits of agreement was found between these devices. Conclusions The 4 devices provided high intraoperator repeatability and interoperator and intersession reproducibility for ACD measurements. Good agreement in ACD measurements was found between the devices in healthy eyes.

Previous studies on surgical specimens of breast tissue have shown that HF ultrasound (20–80 MHz) appears sensitive to a range of breast pathologies. A measurement in the ultrasonic signal called the peak density appears most sensitive to the pathology of the breast. The reproducibility of this parameter has not been quantitatively measured in a comprehensive manner. In parallel to a clinical study being conducted at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, the reproducibility of peak density measurements was studied using chicken and bovine tissue. Tissue was cut into 4 × 3 × 0.5 cm and 4 × 3 × 1.5 cm cubes and tested at 23.4°C. Waveforms were obtained for two types of measurements: (1) where the transducer stayed in contact with the tissue, and (2) where the transducer was lifted from the tissue between measurements. Spectral peak densities were obtained from 640 measurements. Type 1 measurements showed high reproducibility. Type 2 measurements displayed greater variability but were consistent with previous measurements on lumpectomy tissue specimens. The variability of the type 2 measurements is believed to be due to transducer-induced pressure differences between each measurement and is currently being studied.","",""

Results: Here, we describe an existing statistical model that is very well suited to this problem. We explain its utility for assessing the reproducibility of validation experiments, and apply it to a genome-scale study of adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-mediated RNA editing in Drosophila. We also introduce a statistical method for planning validation experiments that will obtain the tightest reproducibility confidence limits, which, for a fixed total number of experiments, returns the optimal number of replicates for the study.

These shifts in mindset include thinking about data stewardship rather than data ownership, embracing transparency throughout the data life-cycle and project duration, and accepting critique in public.

1.There is a high demand for biodiversity observation data to inform conservation and environmental policy, and citizen scientists generate the vast majority of terrestrial biodiversity observations. As this work is voluntary, many people assume that these data are openly available for use in conservation and scientific research.

2.Here, the openness of biodiversity observation data that are contributed to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility is examined by the data provider. Contrary to what many people assume, datasets from volunteers are among the most restrictive in how they can be used.

3.Policy implications. The assumption that voluntary data collection leads to data sharing does not recognize the wishes and motivations of those who collect data, nor does it respect the crucial contributions of these data to long-term monitoring of biodiversity trends. To improve data openness, citizen scientists should be recognised in ways that correspond with their motivations. Furthermore, organisations that manage these data should make their data sharing policies open and explicit.

However, researchers who conduct a replication and want to statistically combine the results of their replication with a statistically significant original study encounter problems when using traditional meta-analysis techniques. The original study’s effect size is most probably overestimated because it is statistically significant, and this bias is not taken into consideration in traditional meta-analysis. We have developed a hybrid method that does take the statistical significance of an original study into account and enables (a) accurate effect size estimation, (b) estimation of a confidence interval, and (c) testing of the null hypothesis of no effect. We analytically approximate the performance of the hybrid method and describe its statistical properties. By applying the hybrid method to data from the Reproducibility Project: Psychology (Open Science Collaboration, 2015), we demonstrate that the conclusions based on the hybrid method are often in line with those of the replication, suggesting that many published psychological studies have smaller effect sizes than those reported in the original study, and that some effects may even be absent. We offer hands-on guidelines for how to statistically combine an original study and replication, and have developed a Web-based application (https://rvanaert.shinyapps.io/hybrid) for applying the hybrid method.","",""

However, the sustainability of Open Access or Open Science services is often a long way from being assured. A relatively new global coalition called SCOSS will enable the international research community, through its institutions and funding organisations, to take responsibility for sustaining those services. It will do this by providing a new co-ordinated cost-sharing framework to ensure that non-commercial OS services that underpin the development of wider global Open Access and Open Science are sustained in the future. The SCOSS group makes recommendations on what to fund and why based on a rigorous evaluation procedure where services are invited to apply and provide extensive information to the SCOSS group. Applicants provide information on the service’s value to communities such as funders, universities, libraries, authors, research managers, repositories, etc.; information on the governance structure, the technical solution, costs, sustainability measures, and their plans for the future. SCOSS is currently in the middle of a pilot to test the concept. Current SCOSS members include the Australasian Open Access Strategy Group (AOASG), the Council of the Australian University Librarians (CAUL), LIBER, EIFL and SPARC Europe with other organisations following the pilot and advising such as the Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR), the European Research Council (ERC), the European University Association (EUA), and others. This presentation will outline the Terms of Reference of the coalition, the case, the SCOSS governance structure, experience with the pilot and challenges to date. This session is of interest to those who are interested in helping the user community to sustain an Open Access and Open Science infrastructure to help implement policy goals, and finding out how they can contribute to making that happen.","",""

We scrutinize these researchers' (1) statistical concern that heightened stringency with respect to false-positives will increase false-negatives and (2) meta-scientific concern that larger samples and executing direct replications engender opportunity costs that will decrease the rate of making novel discoveries. We argue their statistical concern is unwarranted given open science proponents recommend such practices to reduce the inflated Type I error rate from .35 down to .05 and simultaneously call for high-powered research to reduce the inflated Type II error rate. Regarding their meta-concern, we demonstrate that incurring some costs is required to increase the rate (and frequency) of making true discoveries because distinguishing true from false hypotheses requires a low Type I error rate, high statistical power, and independent direct replications. We also examine pragmatic concerns raised regarding adopting open science practices for relationship science (pre-registration, open materials, open data, direct replications, sample size); while acknowledging these concerns, we argue they are overstated given available solutions. We conclude benefits of open science practices outweigh costs for both individual researchers and the collective field in the long run, but that short term costs may exist for researchers because of the currently dysfunctional academic incentive structure. Our analysis implies our field's incentive structure needs to change whereby better alignment exists between researcher's career interests and the field's cumulative progress. We delineate recent proposals aimed at such incentive structure re-alignment.",WOS:000405585400003,JOURNAL OF PERSONALITY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY

Two observers twice placed the reference frame on 39 3D-stereophotogrammetry facial images of children with orofacial clefts and control children. The observers' performances were analyzed by calculating mean distance, distance variability, and P95 between the same facial surfaces at two different time points. Correlations between observers were analyzed with Pearson's correlation coefficient. The influence of presence of a cleft, absence of one ear in the photograph, and age on the reproducibility of the reference frame was checked using Student's t test. Results of intraobserver comparisons showed a mean distance of <0.40 mm, distance variability of <0.51 mm, and P95 of <0.80 mm. For interobserver reliability, the mean distance was <0.52 mm, distance variability was <0.53 mm, and P95 was <1.10 mm. Presence of a cleft, age, and absence of one ear on the 3D photograph did not have a significant influence on the reproducibility of placing the reference frame.

A direct measure of impact would require tracking data (re)use in the wild, which is difficult to achieve. This is therefore commonly replaced by simpler metrics based on data download and citation counts. In this paper we describe a scenario where it is possible to track the trajectory of a dataset after its publication, and show how this enables the design of accurate models for ascribing credit to data originators. A Data Trajectory (DT) is a graph that encodes knowledge of how, by whom, and in which context data has been re-used, possibly after several generations. We provide a theoretical model of DTs that is grounded in the W3C PROV data model for provenance, and we show how DTs can be used to automatically propagate a fraction of the credit associated with transitively derived datasets, back to original data contributors. We also show this model of transitive credit in action by means of a Data Reuse Simulator. In the longer term, our ultimate hope is that credit models based on direct measures of data reuse will provide further incentives to data publication. We conclude by outlining a research agenda to address the hard questions of creating, collecting, and using DTs systematically across a large number of data reuse instances in the wild.","",""

administrative and heritage materials, conference proceedings as well as pre-prints and post-print of journal
articles. The study recommends the intensification of open science advocacy in academic libraries in Sub-
Saharan Africa; institutions should ensure that there is a stable electricity supply as well as reliable internet
connectivity, introducing regular training on emerging media technologies to the community members and

Fourteen elite male handball players completed each exercise comprising two periods of 10min interspersed with 2min recovery in separate occasions and repeated them one week apart. Exercises consisted of intermittent 30s-30s shuttle running (ISR), intermittent 30s-30s small-sided game (with 3-a-side field players, 3vs3) and match play (with 6-a-side field players, 6vs6). Mean HR demonstrated high level of reproducibility for the three drills (r = 0.86-0.89, TEM = 2.21-2.63 bpm, CV = 1.23-1.55%). For time spent in heart rate zones TEMs reached up 1.12, 1.40 and 2.48 min for ISR, 6vs6 and 3vs3, respectively. Specifically for HR zone higher than 90% of HRmax, CVs showed wide extent of scores with 9.73 (ISR), 27.39 (6vs6) and 108.29% (3vs3). Mean HR results suggest that physiological response was consistent between sessions. Because of the poor reproducibility for time spent in the target zone higher than 90% of HRmax, the efficiency of both 3vs3 and 6vs6 in improving aerobic power should be analysed with caution. The present results suggest that reproducibility of physiological demand of ball-drills should be considered before prescribing them as conditioning training.","",""

We formally model these trade-offs and empirically test for differences using a survey of German and UK bio-scientists. Increased competition has a negative impact on sharing in both contexts. But career stage has an effect only on specific sharing with untenured faculty less likely to share. Further, scientists in larger teams are more likely to share specifically, but less likely to share generally.

Prior to assessing precision, optimal geometric and electrospray solvent parameters were determined to maximize the number of detected lipid species and associated Total Ion Count (TIC). The same settings were utilized for all subsequent experiments. Repeatability measurements were performed using the same instrument, by the same operator on a total of 16 tissue sections (four from each quadrant of the tumor). Reproducibility measurements were determined in a different laboratory, on a separate DESI-MS platform and by an independent operator on 4 sections of one quadrant and compared to the corresponding measurements made for the repeatability experiments. The mean ± SD CV of lipid ion intensities was found to be 22 ± 7% and 18 ± 8% as measures of repeatability and reproducibility, respectively.

There has been little to no work examining the reproducibility of network metrics derived from different types of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data (e.g., resting vs. task related, or pulse sequences other than standard blood oxygen level dependent [BOLD] data) or of measures of network structure at levels other than summary statistics. Here, we take up these questions, comparing the reproducibility of graphs derived from resting arterial spin-labeling perfusion fMRI with those derived from BOLD scans collected while the participant was performing a task. We also examine the reproducibility of the anatomical connectivity implied by the graph by investigating test–retest consistency of the graphs’ edges. We compare two measures of graph-edge consistency both within versus between subjects and across data types. We find a dissociation in the reproducibility of network metrics, with metrics from resting data most reproducible at lower frequencies and metrics from task-related data most reproducible at higher frequencies; that same dissociation is not recapitulated, however, in network structure, for which the task-related data are most consistent at all frequencies.

Results indicate that high levels of academic entrepreneurship in a scientific field are associated with less reliance on the gift-giving form of sharing (i.e., generalized exchange) traditionally recommended by scientific communities, and with a greater emphasis on direct benefits for givers (i.e., direct exchange), as well as a lower overall frequency of sharing. We observe these shifts in sharing behavior even among individual scientists who are not themselves entrepreneurially active; this suggests a general shift in scientific norms contingent on institutional contexts. These findings reflect contradictions inherent in current science policies that simultaneously encourage open science as well as commercial application of research results, and they suggest that the increasing emphasis on commercial activity may fundamentally change the normative structure of science.

This will make it likely that repeated runs of a program will not execute operations like reductions in exactly the same order. This in turn will make reproducibility, i.e. getting bitwise identical results from run to run, difficult to achieve, because floating point operations like addition are not associative, so computing sums in different orders often leads to different results.

An e-survey was designed to provide insight into respondent’s current and future engagement with science communication activities. Respondents provided a wide range of ideas and concerns as to the ‘common practice’ of academic science communication, and whilst they support some of these popular approaches (such as open-door events and science festivals), there are alternatives that may enable wider engagement. Suggestions of internet-based approaches and digital media were strongly encouraged, and although respondents found merits in methods such as science festivals, limitations such as geography, time and topic of interest were a barrier to engagement for some. Academics and scientists need to think carefully about how they plan their science communication activities and carry out evaluations, including considering the point of view of the public, as although defaulting to hands-on open door events at their university may seem like the expected standard, it may not be the best way to reach the intended audience.","",""

Scale is clearly beneficial for these systems, however it also makes them difficult to design and test. Large scale data sets can be difficult to acquire and may not contain important meta-information (e.g. ground truth). Further, their limited availability can make it extremely difficult to understand how well experimental results would reproduce in differ- ent conditions, or at different networks. In this article, we discuss using simulation to overcome these challenges. We present an augmented version of LESS, our recently proposed agent based simulator for evaluating large scale network security systems. LESS uses publicly available data sets and high level parameters to generate synthetic traffic that models large scale, multi- network scenarios. Essentially, LESS allows researchers to \"scale up\" the data and statistics about networks and attacks that they have access to, so that they can be used to test large scale network security systems. Researchers can also tune LESS's high level parameters to better understand the sensitivities of their systems, and the reproducibility of their results. The version of LESS that we discuss in this article is extended to allow researchers to study an additional factor of system performance related to reproducibility: deployment location; by modeling the global Internet topology at the Autonomous System level. We demonstrate the applicability and benefits of LESS by tuning it with publicly available traces and then using generated records to reproduce and extend results from several recently proposed large scale security systems. In new experiments, we use LESS to study how deployment location affects large scale security systems. Our results demonstrate that LESS can evoke realistic performance from these systems with minimal tuning and provide insight into the network and topological factors that may affect the reproducibility of their evaluations.",WOS:000388212600004,JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SECURITY

A new online site ([PsychFileDrawer.org][1]) lets psychologists post results of replications of experiments—whether they succeed or fail—that would ordinarily never leave their file drawer because most journals decline to publish straightforward replication studies. And a group of more than 50 academic psychologists, which calls itself the Open Science Collaboration, has begun an unprecedented, large-scale project to systematically replicate psychological experiments recently published in leading journals. Some researchers are optimistic that many published findings will be replicated. But others are concerned that if the project confirms few studies, it could unfairly indict psychology. Indeed, the prospect of exposing psychology's foibles has upset some scientists.

The general idea of establishing an open source community dedicated to software for scientific applications was understood and appreciated by most people. However, the lack of a precise definition of goals and scope is a limiting factor that has also made many people sceptical of the initiative. In order to understand more precisely what such an open source initiative should do and how, EMI has started a more formal feasibility study around a concept called ScienceSoft — Open Software for Open Science. A group of people from interested parties was created in December 2011 to be the ScienceSoft Steering Committee with the short-term mandate to formalize the discussions about the initiative and produce a document with an initial high-level description of the motivations, issues and possible solutions and a general plan to make it happen. The conclusions of the initial investigation were presented at CERN in February 2012 at a ScienceSoft Workshop organized by EMI. Since then, presentations of ScienceSoft have been made in various occasions, in Amsterdam in January 2012 at the EGI Workshop on Sustainability, in Taipei in February at the ISGC 2012 conference, in Munich in March at the EGI/EMI Conference and at OGF 34 in March.

The reliability was evaluated by comparing the categorization of 24 cases by clinical pharmacists with categorization performed by the project group. Reproducibility was explored by re-categorization of a sample of existing records in the DRP-database by two project group members individually. Main outcome measures Observed proportion of agreement and Fleiss’ kappa as measures of inter-rater reliability and reproducibility. Results The practice use study of 12 hospital pharmacy locations revealed that when implementing the DRP-database, the majority of identified DRPs are documented in the DRP-database, however, some variations throughout the country exist. The interrater reliability study of 34 clinical pharmacists showed high inter-rater reliability with the project group (Fleiss’ kappa = 0.79 with 95 % CI (0.70; 0.88)), and the reproducibility study also documented high inter-rater reliability of a sample of 379 records from the DRP-database re-categorized by two project group members (Fleiss’ kappa = 0.81 with 95 % CI (0.78; 0.85)). Conclusion The study showed high reliability and reproducibility of the DRP-database, however, some local variation in the use of the DRP-database throughout the country existed affecting the overall quality. These findings indicate that data in the DRP-database may be pooled, and national analyses may be conducted to explore development areas for common interest.",WOS:000340093900012,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY

The first group consisted of 10 orthopedic surgeons with a minimum of 5 years of experience. The second group consisted of 10 orthopedic residents in their first two years of practice. Interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility were assessed using Cohen’s kappa test. 
Results: None of the classifications achieved good – very good reliability levels. The Fernandez classification had a moderate and the others had a fair interobserver agreement kappa coefficient. All classifications had fair kappa intraobserver agreement although the Frykman and Fernandez classifications had better results.

The authors assessed reproducibility of power output at seven markers in 11 fit subjects over at least six trials under tightly controlled conditions. Subjects undertook incremental exercises (50 W start, +50 W every 3 min to exhaustion) on a cycle ergometer. At each trial blood lactate concentration was determined at rest and within the final 30 s of each stage. The Rest+1, 2.0 and 4.0 mmol/l markers were determined by interpolation, the D-max and nadir using a quadratic model and the lactate slope index using an exponential plus constant model, and a visual turnpoint was determined empirically. Intraclass correlations and coefficients of variation assessed reproducibility. Power output at all markers differed significantly between subjects, but not between trials.

To evaluate the reproducibility of the pancreatic apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measured at different MR scanners.



Materials and Methods

Twenty-four healthy volunteers underwent three consecutive diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) at a GE 1.5 Tesla (T), a Siemens 1.5T and a Philips 3.0T (session 1), and imaged again using the same protocol at the same GE 1.5T (session 2) 12 days later. The ADC values of pancreas were measured at all three MR scanners. Paired-sample t-test and the Bland-Altman method were used for ADC data analysis.



Results

The individual mean ADC values of pancreatic head, body, and tail (in 10−3mm2/s) measured at GE 1.5T (2.24, 2.01, 1.88 for observer 1 and 2.23, 2.00, 1.92 for observer 2) and Siemens 1.5T (2.24, 2.04, 1.84 for observer 1 and 2.20, 1.98, 1.84 for observer 2) were significantly higher than those at Philips 3.0T (2.06, 1.80, 1.56 for observer 1 and 2.02, 1.79, 1.60 for observer 2) (P = 0.000–0.008). There was no significant difference of ADC values either between GE 1.5T and Siemens 1.5T (P = 0.115–0.966), or between imaging session 1 and 2 at GE 1.5T (P = 0.072–0.938). The range of mean difference ± limits of agreement (in 10−3mm2/s) was −0.07–0.04 ± 0.39–0.53 between two 1.5T scanners, and −0.04–0.04 ± 0.24–0.47 between two imaging sessions at GE 1.5T.



Conclusion

The measured ADC values of pancreas are affected by the field strength of scanner, but show good reproducibility between different MR systems with same field strength and at the same MR system over time.

The assessment of parameter reproducibility is usually accomplished by methods which do not take into account the fact that these parameters are estimated with uncertainty. This is particularly relevant in physiological and clinical studies where usually reproducibility cannot be assessed by multiple testing and is usually assessed from a single replication of the test. Working in a suitable stochastic framework, here we propose a new index (S) to measure reproducibility which takes into account parameter uncertainty and is particularly suited to handle the normal testing conditions of physiological and clinical investigations. Simulation results prove that S, by properly taking into account parameter uncertainty, is more accurate and robust than the methods available in the literature. The new metric is applied to assess reproducibility of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell responsivity of a mixed meal tolerance test from data obtained in the same subjects retested a week apart. Results show that the indices of insulin sensitivity and beta-cell responsivity to glucose are well reproducible. We conclude that the oral minimal models provide useful indices which can safely be used in prospective studies or to assess the efficacy of a given therapy.",WOS:000356256100005,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSIOLOGY-ENDOCRINOLOGY AND METABOLISM

Usually, reproducibility is impeded because required information, such as the specification of software versions and their configuration, required data sets, and experiment protocols are not mentioned or referenced in most publications. In order to address these issues, we recently introduced an integrated tool chain and its underlying development process to facilitate reproducibility in robotics. In this contribution we instantiate the complete tool chain in a unique user study in order to assess its applicability and usability. To this end, we chose three different robotic systems from independent institutions and modeled them in our tool chain, including three exemplary experiments. Subsequently, we asked twelve researchers to reproduce one of the formerly unknown systems and the associated experiment. We show that all twelve scientists were able to replicate a formerly unknown robotics experiment using our tool chain.","",""

My analysis shows that once P-hacking is accounted for the perceived benefits of the lower threshold all but disappear, prompting two main conclusions: (i) The claimed improvements to false positive rate and replication rate in Benjamin, et al (2017) are exaggerated and misleading.

“Scientists should communicate the data they collect and the models they create, to allow free and open access, and in ways that are intelligible, assessable and usable for other specialists . . . Where data justify it, scientists should make them available in an appropriate data repository.” So said the Royal Society last week, in its report Science as an Open Enterprise: Open Data for Open Science. 1 The report calls for more openness among scientists and with the public and media; greater recognition of the value of data gathering, analysis, and communication; common standards for sharing information to make it widely usable; mandatory publishing of data in a reusable form to support findings; more expertise in managing and supporting the use of digital data; and new software tools to analyse data. It is time for a big shift, says the report, from the status quo where “many scientists still pursue their research through the measured and predictable steps in which they communicate their thinking within relatively closed groups of colleagues; publish their findings, usually in peer reviewed journals; file their data and then move on.”

Because EIT systems are multichannel instruments and the information of all channels is being combined to produce an image, a procedure to standardize the performance assessment must be set up in order to allow for meaningful comparison of different systems or different settings in the same system. We propose the use of three parameters defined long ago but scarcely used among EIT systems designers: SER (Systematic Error Ratio), NER (Noise Error Ratio) and RER (Reciprocity Error Ratio).

An important facet of performing and publishing well-controlled reproducible pre-clinical research is to stabilize and more completely define the environment of the animal subjects. Scientists who use rodents in research generally recognize the importance of maintaining a stable animal environment. However, despite a theoretical and general awareness of these issues, many may lack a true appreciation of how significantly even seemingly minor variations in the environment can affect research outcomes. The purpose of this article is to help investigators gain a more comprehensive and substantiated understanding of the potentially significant impact of even seemingly minor environmental changes on the animals and the data. An important caveat to this article is that the examples presented were selected from a very large literature, admittedly in order to illustrate certain points. The goal of this article is not to provide an overview of the entire literature on how the environment affects rodents but rather to make preclinical scientists more aware of how these factors can potentially influence the experimental data and contribute to poor reproducibility of research.",WOS:000356563800009,EXPERIMENTAL NEUROLOGY

Methods A digital model, an intraoral scan, and a plaster model were made for each of 22 subjects. Tooth-width measurements on the digital model and the intraoral scan were compared with those on the corresponding plaster models (gold standard). Intraclass correlation coefficients were calculated to determine the interexaminer reliability of the measurements of each method. The anterior and overall Bolton ratios were calculated for each participant and for each method. The paired t  test was used to determine the validity. The scanning time for the intraoral scanner was registered and analyzed. Results Tooth-width measurements of each tooth on the digital models and the intraoral scans did not differ significantly from those on the plaster models ( P  >0.05). The overall and anterior Bolton ratios from the 2 types of digital models differed significantly from the gold standard ( P Conclusions Both intraoral scanning and cone-beam computed tomography scanning of alginate impressions are valid, reliable, and reproducible methods to obtain dental measurements for diagnostic purposes.",WOS:000313045500025,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

Visual breast density assessment is subject to significant intra- and inter-rater variability. The aim of the present study was to test the reproducibility of automatic breast density assessment and to compare the results to the visual assessment. Patients and Methods: Serial mammograms of 141 patients were retrospectively reviewed. Breast density was assessed both visually using a BI-RADS four-category breast density scale and with a software tool for volumetric breast density measurement. Results: The intra- and inter-rater reproducibility as well as inter-examination reproducibility were assessed for both techniques by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The inter-examination reproducibility of the volumetric measurement of breast percent density was 0.91 (ICC; 95 % CI 0.87 – 0.93). There was no difference in the strength of the correlation between patients with a large vs. small difference in compression force. The intra- and inter-rater reproducibility ranged from 0.81 – 0.84 and 0.71 – 0.77, respectively. The inter-examination reproducibility of visual assessment was 0.75 – 0.81. The agreement of visual assessment with volumetric measurement was similar to the agreement among readers. Conclusion: Our results indicate that volumetric breast density measurement provides higher reproducibility in serial examinations than visual assessment and may thus be preferable in the longitudinal assessment of breast density and in the measurement of breast density for risk stratification.

Method This was a cross-sectional study in which the intraobserver and interobserver concordance between two readings made by 11 observers was analyzed. The analysis of the variations used the kappa statistical method. Results Moderate concordance was found in relation to the AO classification, while slight concordance was found for the Tronzo classification. Conclusion This study found that the AO/Asif classification for transtrochanteric presented greater intra and interobserver reproducibility and that greater concordance was correlated with greater experience of the observers. Without division into subgroups, the AO/Asif classification was shown, as described in the literature, to be acceptable for clinical use in relation to transtrochanteric fractures of the femur, although it did not show absolute concordance, given that its concordance level was only moderate. Nonetheless, its concordance was better than that of the Tronzo classification.","",""

Yet the focus on agency often glosses over the constraints placed on agents, particularly within asymmetrical power relations. This article follows the case of BabyLegs, a do-it-yourself monitoring tool for marine microplastic pollution, and the attempt to keep the technology open source within an intellectual property (IP) system set up to privatize it. The tactics used to design BabyLegs as a feminine, silly, doll-tool to discredit the device in the eyes of an IP system that valued traditional gender roles lead to the eventual success of keeping the device open source. Yet, those same tactics also reinforced and reproduced the structures of power and essentialism they were designed to resist. I characterize this technological ambivalence as compromise, and argue that all agency exercised within asymmetrical power relations is compromised. This is not to say resistance is futile, but that agency is never pure, and this recognition lets us be more intentional in how we might compromise as practitioners of diverse scientific knowledges.","",""

The reproducibility of angular measurements made on virtual digital models has not as yet been evaluated. In order to study reproducibility for and agreement between a conventional analysis technique and virtual 3D imaging, 20 dental casts from subjects in the early mixed dentition, were measured twice with each technique by two orthodontists. Variables of interest were incisor rotation, angulation and irregularity, arch width, arch circumference, overjet, and overbite. Standard deviation (Dahlberg 1940) and coefficient of variation were used for evaluation of reproducibility. Mean differences between methods and examiners, correlation between mean differences and mean levels and 95% limits of agreement were used for describing systematic errors. The conventional technique showed less intraexaminer variation for angular variables than the 3D imaging method. Linear variables, with the exception of overbite, showed no clear trend as regards differences in reproducibility between the two methods. In general, examiner 1 showed less intraexaminer variation than examiner 2. The mean differences between the two methods expressed higher values for assessment of rotations with the O3DM method. Both angular and linear variables exhibited poor 95% limits of agreement. The conventional technique showed better overall reproducibility and thus appears to be more suitable for scientific work.

This explosion of the use of the term has led to multiple interpretations, ambiguities, and even misunderstandings, not to mention countless debates and disagreements over precise definitions. The paper “Fifty shades of open” by Pomerantz and Peek (2016) highlighted the increasing ambiguity and even confusion surrounding this term. This article builds on Pomerantz and Peek’s attempt to disambiguate the term by offering an alternative understanding to openness — that of social praxis. More specifically, our framing can be broken down into three social processes: open production, open distribution, and open consumption. Each process shares two traits that make them open: you don’t have to pay (free price), and anyone can participate (non-discrimination) in these processes. We argue that conceptualizing openness as social praxis offers several benefits. First, it provides a way out of a variety of problems that result from ambiguities and misunderstandings that emerge from the current multitude of uses of openness. Second, it provides a contextually sensitive understanding of openness that allows space for the many different ways openness is experienced — often very different from the way that more formal definitions conceptualize it. Third, it points us towards an approach to developing practice-specific theory that we believe helps us build generalizable knowledge on what works (or not), for whom, and in what contexts.","",""

Objective The aim was to evaluate the reproducibility of these measurements by using manual techniques and advanced imaging software. Methods Two radiologists measured maximal ascending aorta diameter on CT angiograms in 30 subjects at 4 separate reading sessions—2 with manual techniques and 2 with semiautomated software analysis. Interobserver and intraobserver variabilities were assessed with Bland-Altman plots and Spearman correlation coefficients. Results Interobserver variability was smaller for the software-assisted method. Limits of agreement for the manual method were −4.2 mm and 9.2 mm compared with −4.0 mm and 4.6 mm for the software-assisted method; coefficients of repeatability were 6.8 mm and 4.3 mm. Intraobserver variability was inconsistent between readers. Strong correlation was found between observers who used both methods ( R 2  = 0.8078–0.9881; P Conclusion The use of an advanced imaging software for measurement of ascending aortic aneurysm reduces interobserver variability.,WOS:000333729600004,JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY

Six healthy participants were scanned twice at each site. The imaging protocol consisted of continuous ASL (CASL), pseudo-continuous ASL (p-CASL) with and without background suppression, pulsed ASL (PASL) with single and multiple inversion times (TIs), and selective ASL for segmentation. Reproducibility was expressed in terms of the coefficient of repeatability and the repeatability index. Voxelwise analysis of variance was performed, yielding brain maps that reflected regional variability. Intra- and multicenter reproducibility were comparable for all methods, except for single TI PASL, with better intracenter reproducibility (F-test of equality of two variances, P<0.05). Pseudo-continuous ASL and multi TI PASL varied least between sites. Variability maps of all methods showed most variability near brain-feeding arteries within sessions and in gray matter between sessions. On the basis of the results of this study, one could consider the use of reference values in clinical routine, with whole-brain p-CASL perfusion varying <20% over repeated measurements within the same individuals considered to be normal.

However, recent problems with the reproducibility of empirical results in large-scale systems and in biomedical research have cast doubts on its universal and rigid applicability beyond the so-called basic sciences. Reproducibility is a particularly difficult issue in interdisciplinary work where the results to be reproduced typically refer to different levels of description of the system considered. In such cases, it is mandatory to distinguish between more and less relevant features, attributes or observables of the system, depending on the level at which they are described. For this reason, we propose a scheme for a general ‘relation of relevance’ between the level of complexity at which a system is considered and the granularity of its description. This relation implies relevance criteria for particular selected aspects of a system and its description, which can be operationally implemented by an interlevel relation called ‘contextual emergence’. It yields a formally sound and empirically applicable procedure to translate between descriptive levels and thus construct level-specific criteria for reproducibility in an overall consistent fashion. Relevance relations merged with contextual emergence challenge the old idea of one fundamental ontology from which everything else derives. At the same time, our proposal is specific enough to resist the backlash into a relativist patchwork of unconnected model fragments.",WOS:000333191800004,JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY INTERFACE

The implementation of European Union Regulation on IAS can benefit from the involvement of the public in IAS recording and management through Citizen Science (CS) initiatives. Aiming to tackle issues related with the use of CS projects on IAS topics, a dedicated workshop titled “Citizen Science and Open Data: a model for Invasive Alien Species in Europe” was organized by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) and the European Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST Association). Fifty key stakeholders from all Europe, including two Members of the European Parliament, attended the workshop. With a clear focus on IAS, the workshop aimed at addressing the following issues: a) CS and policy, b) citizen engagement, and c) CS data management. Nine short presentations provided input on CS and IAS issues. Participants discussed specific topics in several round tables (“world cafe” style) and reported back their conclusions to the audience and full assembly moderated discussions. Overall, the workshop enabled the sharing of ideas, approaches and best practices regarding CS and IAS. Specific opportunities and pitfalls of using CS data in the whole policy cycle for IAS were recognized. Concerning the implementation of the IAS Regulation, CS data could complement official surveillance systems, and contribute to the early warning of the IAS of Union concern after appropriate validation by the Member States’ competent authorities. CS projects can additionally increase awareness and empower citizens. Attendees pointed out the importance for further public engagement in CS projects on IAS that demonstrate specific initiatives and approaches and analyze lessons learned from past experiences. In addition, the workshop noted that the data gathered from different CS projects on IAS are fragmented. It highlighted the need for using an open and accessible platform to upload data originating from CS sources or to mirror validated data into a single, easy-to-use web service, in line with the EU Open Science Strategic Priority. The workshop provided ten key recommendations of best practices for CS projects on IAS, addressed to researchers, policy makers and implementing authorities, indicating future research and policy directions and opportunities.","",""

The reproducibility of a standardised exercise test was evaluated in 2 conditions with 2 groups of Standardbred horses: 1) the first condition was a test and a re-test performed with a 1 week interval by 11 trotters on their usual training track (2) the second condition was a test and a re-test performed with another group of 8 horses on 2 different tracks with a 9 day interval, in order to assess the influence of changing the place of the test. The test was composed of 3 steps, conducted at an increasing speed. The duration of each step was 3 min with a 1 min rest between 2 steps at a walking pace. The speed level used for each step depended on the age and fitness of the horses. Mathematic treatment of the collected data, speed, heart rate and venous blood lactate measured after each step, allowed the estimation of 5 fitness parameters: V200, V4, V2, HR2 and HR4. The Spearman rank correlation coefficients calculated for these indicators between the 2 tests measured during the experiment (1) and the experiment (2) were higher than 0.79 (P < 0.05) for V200, V4, V2 and HR2.



The standardised exercise test proposed in the present work, was demonstrated to be reliable in field conditions for Standardbred horses.","",""

The transformation from a subscription based journal market to a fee-based Open Access publishing requires a monitoring of  APC expenditures. This is not only necessary to ensure price transparency on a developing APC market. In fact funding organizations, library consortia and other stakeholders need a valid data base to be able to evaluate Open Access funding policies or transformation strategies. The presentation will give a short overview about existing initiatives to collect APC data and will then introduce the new project “INTACT  - Transparent Infrastructure for fee-based Open Access publishing”. The project, which is funded by the “German Research Foundation” (DFG) and supported by the “DINI working group Electronic Publishing” is a cooperation of Bielefeld University Library, the “Institute for Interdisciplinary Studies of Science” (I2SoS) at Bielefeld University and the Max Planck Digital Library (MPDL). The INTACT approach combines a bibliometric analysis of fee-based Open Access publishing in academic institutions with establishing a standardised reporting and open data service for APC data. By working together with the ESAC initiative ( http://esac-initiative.org/ ), the project wants to increase the efficiency of Open Access publishing workflows in universities and research organizations together with leading Open Access publishers. INTACT uses Open Science workflows for aggregation, use and reuse of APC data. Even before  the official start, 21 german universities and 5 research society funds are providing their data into a GitHub-Repository ( http://openapc.github.io/ ), the datasets are available under a Open Database License. Due to DFG funding policy for Open Access publication funds in Germany, the whole dataset releases  currently information on more than 3.200 articles in real open access journals, which charge publication fees, and total expenditures for more than 4 million EURO. But information about Open Access articles in toll-access journals (\"hybrid\") are provided as well. Further more, the presentation discusses basic requirements for creating an international network for analyzing and monitoring fee-based Open Access publishing.","",""

The weak evidence provided by p- values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks. When you observe p  = 0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3 : 1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the p- value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5%, you would have to assume that you were 87% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe p =  0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100 : 1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive. But the false positive risk would still be 8% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5% you would need to observe p  = 0.00045. It is recommended that the terms ‘significant’ and ‘non-significant’ should never be used. Rather, p- values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed p- value. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of p p- hacking. Precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the only way to be sure. Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by senior people who impose perverse incentives on scientists.",WOS:000418587600034,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE

Three observers performed double blinded randomized analysis of calibrated digital radiographs meeting strict quality criteria. The implant stem–shaft angle and femoral anteversion angle were measured by the trapezoid method of axis determination using OsiriX software. The upper and lower offset and the anterior and posterior offset were measured. The statistical analysis was performed using Pearson correlation tests (intra-observer reproducibility) and Fisher F tests (inter-observer reproducibility). Intra-observer reproducibility was very good for all parameters and all observers. Inter-observer reproducibility was excellent except for superior offset measurement. Thus, this study validates a radiographic method for assessing the femoral implant position in hip resurfacing. We believe this could be useful for future studies on hip resurfacing devices.","",""

Make the reach of your research broader and longer lasting,7,"Summary
Ecological and evolutionary research increasingly uses quantitative synthesis of primary research studies (meta-analysis) for answering fundamental questions, informing environmental policy and summarizing results for decision makers.
Knowing how meta-analysis works is important for researchers so that their research can have broader impact. Meta-analytic thinking encourages scientists to see single primary research studies as substantial contributions to a larger picture.
To facilitate inclusion in a meta-analysis, relevant primary research studies must be found and basic information about the methods and results must be thoroughly, clearly and transparently reported. While many published papers provide this information, it is common for essential data to be omitted, leading to study exclusion from meta-analyses.
We provide guidelines for correctly reporting basic data needed from primary studies in ecology and evolutionary biology so that they can be included in meta-analyses, together with examples that show how data should be reported to enable calculation and analysis of effect sizes, and how data should be made accessible.
These guidelines are important for reporting research results in general, whether or not results are included in subsequent meta-analyses, because they are necessary for the interpretation and assessment of study outcomes. Increased implementation of these guidelines by authors, editors and publishers, and reinforcement by funders, will foster higher quality and more inclusive syntheses, further the goals of transparency and reproducibility in science, and improve the quality and value of primary research studies.",WOS:000402919100012,METHODS IN ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION

It was found that the sensitivity of various components change differently; in our case, variability is in the order of 20-40%, and it is most likely due to changing conditions in electrospray ionization (ESI). The most often used peak area correction methods do not take this effect into account. The change in peak areas can be well described by a polynomial function; we found that a fourth-order polynomial is most often suitable. We suggest a simple correction algorithm based on polynomial fitting. When the experiments were inherently well reproducible, this correction improved reproducibility from 12% to 3% (on average for various components). When random errors were larger, this improvement was less significant (15% to 12% in nano-ESI) but nevertheless essential in order to avoid possible bias in the results.

Setting Private clinic, London, United Kingdom. Design Retrospective case series. Methods This retrospective study comprised patients attending 2 preoperative refractions before laser vision correction. The first manifest refraction was performed by 1 of 7 optometrists and the second manifest refraction by 1 of 2 surgeons, all trained using a standard manifest refraction protocol. Spherocylindrical data were converted into power vectors for analysis. The dioptric power differences between observers were calculated and analyzed. Results One thousand nine hundred twenty-two consecutive eyes were stratified into a myopia group and a hyperopia group and then further stratified by each surgeon–optometrist combination. The mean surgeon–optometrist dioptric power difference was 0.21 diopter (D) (range 0.15 to 0.32 D). The mean difference in spherical equivalent refraction was 0.03 D, with 95% of all refractions within ±0.44 D for all optometrist–surgeon combinations. The severity of myopic or hyperopic ametropia did not affect the interobserver reproducibility of the manifest refraction. Conclusions There was close agreement in refraction between surgeons and optometrists using a standard manifest refraction protocol of less than 0.25 D. This degree of interobserver repeatability is similar to that in intraobserver repeatability studies published to date and may represent the value of training and the use of a standard manifest refraction protocol between refraction observers in a refractive surgery practice involving co-management between surgeons and optometrists.

Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility and factors that can affect accuracy or reproducibility of both manual and automated TAG measurements, including CAD severity and iterative reconstruction, were also assessed. Analysis time was reduced by 68 % when compared to manual TAG measurement. There was excellent correlation between automated TAG and the reference standard manual TAG. Bland–Altman analyses indicated low mean differences (1 HU/cm) and narrower inter- and intra-observer limits of agreement for automated compared to manual measurements (25 and 36 % reduction with automated software, respectively).

First, how scientists currently use SWMSs was determined through a comprehensive usage survey examining 1455 research publications from 2013 to July 31st, 2015. To understand how data-intensive scientists are producing impactful research, we further examined usage of two major research clouds, the Open Science Data Cloud (OSDC) and Cornell's Red Cloud. Here, we present a road map for SWMS development for data-intensive sciences. SWMSs are now needed that interconnect diverse software packages while enabling data exploration and multi-user interaction across distributed software and hardware environments.","",""

We assessed the repeatability and reproducibility of abutment teeth dental impressions, digitized with a blue light scanner, by comparing the discrepancies in repeatability and reproducibility values for different types of abutment teeth. MATERIALS AND METHODS. To evaluate repeatability, impressions of the canine, first premolar, and first molar, prepared for ceramic crowns, were repeatedly scanned to acquire 5 sets of 3-dimensional data via stereolithography (STL) files. Point clouds were compared and the error sizes were measured (n=10, per type). To evaluate reproducibility, the impressions were rotated by 10-20° on the table and scanned. These data were compared to the first STL data and the error sizes were measured (n=5, per type). Oneway analysis of variance was used to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the 3 types of teeth, and Tukey honest significant differences (HSD) multiple comparison test was used for post hoc comparisons (α=.05). RESULTS. The differences with regard to repeatability were 4.5, 2.7, and 3.1 μm for the canine, premolar, and molar, indicating the poorest repeatability for the canine (P<.001). For reproducibility, the differences were 6.6, 5.8, and 11.0 μm indicating the poorest reproducibility for the molar (P=.007). CONCLUSION. Our results indicated that impressions of individual abutment teeth, digitized with a blue light scanner, had good repeatability and reproducibility.

The protocol produces an estimate of the probability of a positive response with a prediction interval within which 95% of laboratories (or analytical runs) are expected to fall when the method is applied in practice. The interval is calculated from the observed reproducibility (or within-laboratory reproducibility) standard deviation. Then a simple plot of prediction intervals for the probability of detection against the concentration of analyte, where the concentration is known, is used to provide an estimate of the range of limits of detection and false positive probability that we can expect to see when the validated method is applied in practice.

METHODS: A single investigator measured the available space in 30 plaster models by using two techniques: 1) with a digital caliper; and 2) by contouring the arch with a brass wire and subsequently straightening and measuring this wire with a millimeter ruler. Fifteen days later, data were collected using both methods with duplicate measurements, so that each method was used twice for each model. The random and systematic errors of each method under the conditions of repeatability and reproducibility were calculated. RESULTS: For method reproducibility, systematic errors were statistically significant (P<0.05) only when the brass wire method was used. The random errors were less than 1 mm under both conditions. With the brass wire, random errors were not significant for repeatability; however, for reproducibility, the mean value was 1.69 mm. CONCLUSION: In the digital caliper method, systematic and random errors were considered acceptable. The brass wire measurement method did not present errors under the condition of repeatability; for reproducibility, however, the systematic error was significant and the random error indicates that this method should be considered inappropriate to measure space in the dental arch.","",""

To develop a novel approach to improve cervical spine (c-spine) curvature reproducibility for head and neck (HN) patients using optical surface imaging (OSI) with two regions of interests (ROIs).

Methods:
The OSI-guided, two-step setup procedure requires two ROIs: ROI-1 of the shoulders and ROI-2 of the face. The neck can be stretched or squeezed in superior-inferior (SI) direction using a specially-designed sliding head support. We hypothesize that when these two ROIs are aligned, the c-spine should fall into a naturally reproducible position under same setup conditions. An anthropomorphous phantom test was performed to examine neck pitch angles comparing with the calculated angles. Three volunteers participated in the experiments, which start with conventional HN setup using skin markers and room lasers. An OSI image and lateral photo-picture were acquired as the references. In each of the three replicate tests, conventional setup was first applied after volunteers got on the couch. ROI-1 was aligned by moving the body, followed by ROI-2 alignment via adjusting head position and orientation under real-time OSI guidance. A final static OSI image and lateral picture were taken to evaluate both anterior and posterior surface alignments. Three degrees of freedom can be adjusted if an open-face mask was applied, including head SI shift using the sliding head support and pitch-and-roll rotations using a commercial couch extension. Surface alignment was analyzed comparing with conventional setup.

Results:
The neck pitch angle measured by OSI is consistent with the calculated (0.2±0.6°). Volunteer study illustrated improved c-spine setup reproducibility using OSI comparing with conventional setup. ROI alignments with 2mm/1° tolerance are achieved within 3 minutes. Identical knee support is important to achieve ROI-1 pitch alignment.

Conclusion:
The feasibility of this novel approach has been demonstrated for c-spine curvature setup reproducibility. Further evaluation is necessary with bony alignment variation in patient studies.

A number of websites make available spectral data for download (typically as JCAMP-DX text files) and one (ChemSpider) that also allows users to contribute spectral files. As a result, searching and retrieving such spectral data can be time consuming, and difficult to reuse if the data is compressed in the JCAMP-DX file. What is needed is a single resource that allows submission of JCAMP-DX files, export of the raw data in multiple formats, searching based on multiple chemical identifiers, and is open in terms of license and access. To address these issues a new online resource called the Open Spectral Database (OSDB) http://osdb.info/ has been developed and is now available. Built using open source tools, using open code (hosted on GitHub), providing open data, and open to community input about design and functionality, the OSDB is available for anyone to submit spectral data, making it searchable and available to the scientific community.

However, test circumstances vary and during test performance, subjects may change position. In other words, the reliability - i.e. reproducibility and validity - of tests for LMC should be based on quantitative data. This has not been considered before. The aim was to analyse the reproducibility of five different quantitative tests for LMC commonly used in daily clinical practice. Methods: The five tests for LMC were: repositioning (RPS), sitting forward lean (SFL), sitting knee extension (SKE), and bent knee fall out (BKFO), all measured in cm, and leg lowering (LL), measured in mm Hg. A total of 40 subjects (14 males, 26 females) 25 with and 15 without LBP, with a mean age of 46.5 years (SD 14.8), were examined independently and in random order by two examiners on the same day. LBP subjects were recruited from three physiotherapy clinics with a connection to the clinic’s gym or back-school. Non-LBP subjects were recruited from the clinic’s staff acquaintances, and from patients without LBP. Results: The means and standard deviations for each of the tests were 0.36 (0.27) cm for RPS, 1.01 (0.62) cm for SFL, 0.40 (0.29) cm for SKE, 1.07 (0.52) cm for BKFO, and 32.9 (7.1) mm Hg for LL. All five tests for LMC had reproducibility with the following ICCs: 0.90 for RPS, 0.96 for SFL, 0.96 for SKE, 0.94 for BKFO, and 0.98 for LL. Bland and Altman plots showed that most of the differences between examiners A and B were less than 0.20 cm. Conclusion: These five tests for LMC displayed excellent reproducibility. However, the diagnostic accuracy of these tests needs to be addressed in larger cohorts of subjects, establishing values for the normal population. Also cutpoints between subjects with and without LBP must be determined, taking into account age, level of activity, degree of impairment and participation in sports. Whether reproducibility of these tests is as good in daily clinical practice when used by untrained examiners also needs to be examined.",WOS:000291748200001,BMC MUSCULOSKELETAL DISORDERS

In this commentary, I discuss how a poor appreciation of the role of chance in statistical inference contributes to this problem. In particular, how poor scientific design, such as low statistical power, and questionable research practices, such as post hoc hypothesizing and undisclosed flexibility in analyses, yield a high proportion of false-positive results. I discuss how the current publication and funding system perpetuates this poor practice by rewarding positive, yet often unreliable, results over rigorous methods. I conclude by discussing how scientists can prevent being fooled by chance findings by adopting well established, but often ignored, methodological best-practice.

There is increasing awareness of the problem of unreliable findings across biomedical sciences (Ioannidis, 2005). Many “landmark” findings could not be replicated (Scott et al., 2008; Begley and Ellis, 2012; Steward et al., 2012) and many promising preclinical findings have failed to translate into clinical application (Perel et al., 2007; Prinz et al., 2011), leading many to question whether science is broken (Economist,2013). Central to this problem is a poor appreciation of the role of chance in the scientific process. As neuroscience has developed over the past 50 years, many of the large, easily observable effects have been found, and the field is likely pursuing smaller and more subtle effects. The corresponding growth in computational capabilities (Moore, 1998) means that researchers can run numerous tests on a single dataset in a matter of minutes. The human brain processes randomness poorly, and the huge potential for undisclosed analytical flexibility in modern data-management packages leaves researchers increasingly vulnerable to being fooled by chance.

Researchers cannot measure an entire population of interest, so they take samples and use statistical inference to determine the probability that the results …",WOS:000391928700004,ENEURO

In this study the reproducibility and applicability for pigment dosing of a commercial available EFD® dispenser were tested. The reproducibility of a Performus™ II type EFD® dispenser was tested by repeating dosing experiments with a set of eight syringes filled with pigment pastes (Factor 2; Flagstaff, USA). To evaluate conventional colour matching, four conventionally colour matched samples were polymerized and compared to the original ones. To investigate the reproducibility of the dispenser in practice, a fifth recipe was dispensed 10 times and colour differences were evaluated visually and as well calculated from measurements with a colour and translucency meter (CTM, PBSensortechnology bv). All dispensed amounts of pigment pastes showed a coefficient of variation in weight of less than 10 %. Evaluating the reproductions of four skin batches compared to the original batches, a ∆E2000 colour difference of 3–7 was measured. Evaluating ten reproductions of one skin coloured batch made with the dispenser, color difference ∆E2000 values compared to the average L*a*b* values, were less than 2 and no visual colour differences could be estimated. Conform these results, low colour differences could be measured with the CTM, indicating no visually observable consequences. Despite the estimated coefficient of variation, the reproducibility of the EFD® dispenser in terms of colour difference ∆E2000 of successive dispensing is applicable for colour reproduction in facial prosthetics. Segregation of the current color pastes in due time needs to be taken into consideration.","",""

Key elements of this standard are the quality criteria for trueness and precision (repeatability). Both are linked to standard values of n-butanol in nitrogen. It is assumed in this standard that whenever a laboratory complies with the overall sensory quality criteria for n-butanol, the quality level is transferable to other, environmental, odors. Although olfactometry is well established, little has been done to investigate inter laboratory variance (reproducibility). Therefore, the objective of this study was to estimate the reproducibility of odor laboratories complying with EN 13725 as well as to investigate the transferability of n-butanol quality criteria to other odorants. Based upon the statistical analysis of 412 odor measurements on 33 sources, distributed in 10 proficiency tests, it was established that laboratory, panel and panel session are components of variance that significantly differ between n-butanol and other odorants ( α  = 0.05). This finding does not support the transferability of the quality criteria, as determined on n-butanol, to other odorants and as such is a cause for reconsideration of the present single reference odorant as laid down in EN 13725. In case of non-butanol odorants, repeatability standard deviation ( s r ) and reproducibility standard deviation ( s R ) were calculated to be 0.108 and 0.282 respectively (log base-10). The latter implies that the difference between two consecutive single measurements, performed on the same testing material by two or more laboratories under reproducibility conditions, will not be larger than a factor 6.3 in 95% of cases. As far as n-butanol odorants are concerned, it was found that the present repeatability standard deviation ( s r  = 0.108) compares favorably to that of EN 13725 ( s r  = 0.172). It is therefore suggested that the repeatability limit ( r ), as laid down in EN 13725, can be reduced from r  ≤ 0.477 to r  ≤ 0.31.",WOS:000332143100002,ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT

Speckle tracking echocardiography is able to quantify left ventricular (LV) rotation and twist. So far this new technique has not been used in congenital heart disease patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the feasibility and the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of LV rotation parameters in adult patients with congenital heart disease. Methods and Results: The study population consisted of 66 consecutive patients seen in the outpatient clinic (67% male, mean age 31 7.7 years, NYHA class 1 0.3) with a variety of congenital heart disease. First, feasibility was assessed in all patients. Intraand inter-observer reproducibility was assessed for the patients in which speckle tracking echocardiography was feasible. Adequate image quality, for performing speckle echocardiography, was found in 80% of patients. The bias for the intra-observer reproducibility of the LV twist was 0.0°, with 95% limits of agreement of 2.5° and 2.5° and for interobserver reproducibility the bias was 0.0°, with 95% limits of agreement of 3.0° and 3.0°. Intra- and inter-observer measurements showed a strong correlation (0.86 and 0.79, respectively). Also a good repeatability was seen. The mean time to complete full analysis per subject for the first and second measurement was 9 and 5 minutes, respectively. Conclusion: Speckle tracking echocardiography is feasible in 80% of adult patients with congenital heart disease and shows excellent intra- and inter-observer reproducibility.

Methods A continuous quality improvement process was devised that involves testing reproducibility by assessment of measurement differences followed by robust review, retraining, and retesting. Reproducibility was deemed acceptable if ≥80% of all interreader comparisons were within a prespecified acceptable difference. Readers not meeting this standard underwent retraining and retesting until acceptable reproducibility was achieved for the following parameters: left ventricular end-diastolic volume, biplane ejection fraction, mitral and aortic regurgitation, left ventricular outflow tract diameter, peak and mean aortic valve gradients, and aortic valve area. Eight hundred interreader comparisons for evaluation of reproducibility were generated from five readers interpreting 10 echocardiograms per testing cycle. The applicability and efficacy of this method were then evaluated by testing a second larger group of 10 readers and reevaluating reproducibility 1 year later. Results All readers demonstrated acceptable reproducibility for biplane ejection fraction, mitral regurgitation, and peak and mean aortic valve gradients. Acceptable reproducibility for left ventricular end-diastolic volume, aortic regurgitation, and aortic valve area was achieved by four of five readers. No readers attained acceptable reproducibility on initial evaluation of left ventricular outflow tract diameter.

However, there were differences with a trend that suggested the influence of experience. Therefore, we performed a prospective study to investigate whether experience influenced the reproducibility of the commonly used developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) classifications. Hypothesis The hypothesis was that the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility scores would be higher in the senior group than the junior group, and particularly for the modified Co classification. Methods Four seniors and four residents classified 104 A/P pelvic radiographs (200 hips) two times using the Cr, Ha and Co classification systems. Results For intra-observer reproducibility, the average weighted concordance coefficients [95% confidence intervals] were for the senior and the junior groups: 92.2 [88.6–95.7] and 92.6 [87.9–97.2] for Cr, 92.1 [88.7–94.6] and 92.0 [87.7–96.3] for Ha, 94.2 [91.8–96.6] and 94.1 [91.5–96.6] for Co. The average weighted Kappa (95% confidence intervals) were 0.8 [0.71–0.88] and 0.79 [0.68–0.89] for Cr, 0.77 [0.74–0.81] and 0.75 [0.62–0.88] for Ha, 0.82 [0.76–0.89] and 0.80 [0.74–0.87] for Co. The junior inter-observer reproducibility multi-rater Kappa (list A:list B) were 0.57:0.50 (Cr), 0.47:0.53 (Ha), 0.42:0.42 (Co). Senior multi-rater Kappa were 0.53:0.49 (Cr), 0.40:0.34 (Ha), 0.40:0.43 (Co).

The journal is published in cooperation of three institutions: the Slovenian Forestry Institute, Department of Forestry and Renewable Forest Resources and Department of Wood Science and Technology at Biotechnical Faculty of the University of Ljubljana. In 2013, with no. 100, its current title has been introduced with the purpose of boosting the internationalization of the journal. Several other changes have also been done on graphical design, home page, policy strategy, open access to bring the journal closer to all levels of readers, and a fully electronic submission system. The journal is under evaluation within two major databases, Web of Science and Scopus. Also the process of obtaining DOI for all articles has been lounged (e.g. membership in a specific DOI organization).  In addition the digitalization process of 643 articles from the Zbornik gozdarstva in lesarstva was conducted and entered into the repository SciVie.  With all these activities we try to enable use and re-use of new and old materials that might otherwise not be readily accessible, and we thus support the advancement of forest research and development.","",""

Our study contributes to this growing interest in quality assurance by presenting simple quantitative methods for assessing the reproducibility of analytic results through blind reanalysis of animal remains that we developed during analysis of fishbone from Cḯx w icən, a large Native American village on the coast of Washington State, U.S.A. Given the large scale of the Cḯx w icən project – over 112,000 fish remains were documented by five different analysts over three years – there was a real possibility that inconsistencies in laboratory practices affected analytic results (e.g., number of identified specimens, taxa present and relative abundance, elements identified, burning frequencies). To evaluate the reproducibility of the Cḯx w icən fishbone data, and the possibility of “protocol drift” – changes in how specimens and bone modifications were identified over the course of analysis – we reanalyzed samples of fish remains that were previously documented during three discrete stages (beginning, middle, and end) of the Cḯx w icən project. The original data and the reanalysis results show close agreement in each stage, with only minor differences in the numbers of recorded specimens, taxonomic representation at family- and finer taxonomic levels, and body part representation assessed for a single taxonomic order. Identifying burning on bone was not very reproducible. Reproducibility studies such as this are useful for highlighting ambiguous identification criteria (e.g., in taxonomic assignment, bone modification), and could stimulate dialog among researchers about ways to address such issues in future studies. Increasing the implementation of these, and other, widely applicable methods should improve zooarchaeological data quality and stimulate further research on quality assurance in archaeology overall.",WOS:000415615800064,JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE-REPORTS

Automated impedance manometry pressure-flow analysis (AIM analysis) determines pressure measurements relative to bolus flow and has to date shown subtle variations in esophageal motility in relation to dysphagia. In this study, we assessed intra- and inter-rater reproducibility of AIM metrics derived using purpose designed software.



Methods

Fifty patients referred for evaluation of gastro-esophageal reflux symptoms (33 men, age 52 ± 1.9 years) underwent combined high-resolution impedance manometry and completed a dysphagia questionnaire. From 10 liquid and 10 viscous swallows, a subset of four swallows (two saline and two viscous) was systematically selected from each patient for manual and AIMplot analysis, which was performed twice by five observers (two experts, three non-experts). Intra- and inter-rater agreement were determined using intraclass correlation coefficients.



Key Results

AIMplot-based analysis showed high intra-rater and inter-rater reproducibility for all metrics (mean ICCs of 0.95 and 0.94, respectively). Reproducibility of metrics derived for liquid and viscous did not differ (ICCs of 0.96 and 0.91 for liquid and viscous, respectively). In addition, metrics derived by experts had an equivalent level of reproducibility compared to non-experts (ICCs of 0.96 and 0.94, respectively). Variables that could be derived with commercial software (ManoView™) correlated highly with variables from AIMplot-based analysis, such as 4-s integrated relaxation pressure (r = 0.85) and the 20-mmHg isobaric contour defect (r = 0.92).



Conclusions & Inferences

Esophageal AIM analysis is highly reproducible, independent of an observer's level of experience in esophageal motility. Therefore, AIM analysis produces data that are reliable for clinical and research purposes.",WOS:000329791100003,NEUROGASTROENTEROLOGY AND MOTILITY

The authors estimated reproducibility of IVF traits including number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte maturity, fertilization, embryo quality and pregnancy using the inter-class (Pearson) correlation coefficient between the repeated IVF cycle measurements for the same patient by variance component analysis [1].

They reported that the number of oocytes retrieved from patients and their fertilization rate had the highest reproducibility coefficients (r = 0.81 ~ 0.84), which indicated a very close correlation between the first retrieval cycle and subsequent IVF cycles. Oocyte maturity and number of top quality embryos had middle level reproducibility (r = 0.38 ~ 0.76) and pregnancy rate had a relative lower reproducibility (r = 0.23 ~ 0.27) [1]. This result has nothing to do with reliability analysis and actually is one of the common mistakes [2–4]. Figure 1 shows non reproducibility illustrated by dotted line; however, we will get high correlation coefficients in all situations (r > 0.8). It is important to know that concluding reproducibility in such situations is a common mistake.

They concluded that their results allow them to predict future IVF cycle outcomes. For prediction studies, we need two different cohort data set or at least one splited cohort dataset to develop our prediction model and then to validate our model [2,3,5].

On the future of document supply in the world of open science,0,"Purpose
The purpose of this paper is to propose a personal viewpoint on the development of document supply in the context of the recent European Union (EU) decisions on open science.

Design/methodology/approach
The paper provides some elements to the usual questions of service development, about business, customers, added value, environment and objectives.

Findings
The EU goal for open science is 100 per cent available research results in 2020. To meet the challenge, document supply must change, include more and other content, serve different targets groups, apply innovative technology and provide knowledge. If not, document supply will become a marginalized library service.

Originality/value
Basically, open science is not library-friendly, and it does not offer a solution for the actual problems of document supply. But it may provide an opportunity for document supply to become a modern service able to deal with new forms of unequal access and digital divide.",WOS:000390712000003,INTERLENDING & DOCUMENT SUPPLY

In this paper, the process of simulation studies is systematized based on a formally specified hypothesis. By this means, the research hypothesis becomes the key element of the study and guides the entire process. Hypothesis-driven simulation studies allow for the automated design, execution, and evaluation of experiments based on specific research questions.

However, new tools and technologies, massive amounts of data, interdisciplinary approaches, and the complexity of the questions being asked are complicating replication efforts, as are increased pressures on scientists to advance their research [2]. As full replication of studies on independently collected data is often not feasible, there has recently been a call for reproducible research as an attainable minimum standard for assessing the value of scientific claims [3]. This requires that papers in experimental science describe the results and provide a sufficiently clear protocol to allow successful repetition and extension of analyses based on original data [4].

The importance of replication and reproducibility has recently been exemplified through studies showing that scientific papers commonly leave out experimental details essential for reproduction [5], studies showing difficulties with replicating published experimental results [6], an increase in retracted papers [7], and through a high number of failing clinical trials [8], [9]. This has led to discussions on how individual researchers, institutions, funding bodies, and journals can establish routines that increase transparency and reproducibility. In order to foster such aspects, it has been suggested that the scientific community needs to develop a “culture of reproducibility” for computational science, and to require it for published claims [3].

We want to emphasize that reproducibility is not only a moral responsibility with respect to the scientific field, but that a lack of reproducibility can also be a burden for you as an individual researcher. As an example, a good practice of reproducibility is necessary in order to allow previously developed methodology to be effectively applied on new data, or to allow reuse of code and results for new projects. In other words, good habits of reproducibility may actually turn out to be a time-saver in the longer run.

We further note that reproducibility is just as much about the habits that ensure reproducible research as the technologies that can make these processes efficient and realistic. Each of the following ten rules captures a specific aspect of reproducibility, and discusses what is needed in terms of information handling and tracking of procedures. If you are taking a bare-bones approach to bioinformatics analysis, i.e., running various custom scripts from the command line, you will probably need to handle each rule explicitly. If you are instead performing your analyses through an integrated framework (such as GenePattern [10], Galaxy [11], LONI pipeline [12], or Taverna [13]), the system may already provide full or partial support for most of the rules. What is needed on your part is then merely the knowledge of how to exploit these existing possibilities.

In a pragmatic setting, with publication pressure and deadlines, one may face the need to make a trade-off between the ideals of reproducibility and the need to get the research out while it is still relevant. This trade-off becomes more important when considering that a large part of the analyses being tried out never end up yielding any results. However, frequently one will, with the wisdom of hindsight, contemplate the missed opportunity to ensure reproducibility, as it may already be too late to take the necessary notes from memory (or at least much more difficult than to do it while underway). We believe that the rewards of reproducibility will compensate for the risk of having spent valuable time developing an annotated catalog of analyses that turned out as blind alleys.

As a minimal requirement, you should at least be able to reproduce the results yourself. This would satisfy the most basic requirements of sound research, allowing any substantial future questioning of the research to be met with a precise explanation. Although it may sound like a very weak requirement, even this level of reproducibility will often require a certain level of care in order to be met. There will for a given analysis be an exponential number of possible combinations of software versions, parameter values, pre-processing steps, and so on, meaning that a failure to take notes may make exact reproduction essentially impossible.

With this basic level of reproducibility in place, there is much more that can be wished for. An obvious extension is to go from a level where you can reproduce results in case of a critical situation to a level where you can practically and routinely reuse your previous work and increase your productivity. A second extension is to ensure that peers have a practical possibility of reproducing your results, which can lead to increased trust in, interest for, and citations of your work [6], [14].

We here present ten simple rules for reproducibility of computational research. These rules can be at your disposal for whenever you want to make your research more accessible—be it for peers or for your future self.",WOS:000330355300042,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

However, non-determinism in concurrency scheduling often hampers achieving this ability on high performance computing (HPC) systems. To aid in managing the adverse effects of non-determinism, prior work has provided techniques to achieve bit-precise reproducibility, but most of them focus only on small-scale parallelism. While scalable techniques recently emerged, they are disparate and target special purposes, e.g., single-schedule domains. On current systems with O (10 6 ) compute cores and future ones with O (10 9 ), any technique that does not embrace a unified, targeted , and multilevel approach will fall short of providing reproducibility. In this paper, we argue for a common toolset that embodies this approach, where programmers select and compose complementary tools and can effectively, yet scalably, analyze, control, and eliminate sources of non-determinism at scale. This allows users to gain reproducibility only to the levels demanded by specific code development needs. We present our research agenda and ongoing work toward this goal.","",""

Ultrasonographic cineloops were captured by one examiner from each horse for five consecutive days. During each examination at least three cineloops were obtained for five different intestinal tract locations. Measurements were performed by three separate observers to assess reproducibility and measured on three separate occasions by three observers to evaluate short-term repeatability. The repeatability of measurements from the duodenum (0.3±0.04 cm), jejunum (0.29±0.05 cm), ventral colon (0.37±0.01 cm), and cecum (0.42±0.03 cm) were good (P>0.291). The reproducibility of measurements from the duodenum, jejunum, and ventral colon were good (P>0.394). Reproducibility of measurement of the cecal wall was inadequate (P=0.01), although the maximum difference between observers was 0.07 cm. It was possible to image all areas on all days, with the exception of the duodenum, which could not be imaged in one horse, on 1 day. Equine intestinal wall measurements are therefore repeatable and reproducible with the exception of reproducibility of the measurements of cecal wall.

Knowledge of reproducibility of accelerometer-determined physical activity (PA) and sedentary time (SED) estimates are a prerequisite to conduct high-quality epidemiological studies. Yet, estimates of reproducibility might differ depending on the approach used to analyze the data. The aim of the present study was to determine the reproducibility of objectively measured PA and SED in children by directly comparing a day-by-day and a week-by-week approach to data collected over two weeks during two different seasons 3–4 months apart.


Methods 
676 11-year-old children from the Active Smarter Kids study conducted in Sogn og Fjordane county, Norway, performed 7 days of accelerometer monitoring (ActiGraph GT3X+) during January-February and April-May 2015. Reproducibility was calculated using a day-by-day and a week-by-week approach applying mixed effect modelling and the Spearman Brown prophecy formula, and reported using intra-class correlation (ICC), Bland Altman plots and 95% limits of agreement (LoA).


Results 
Applying a week-by-week approach, no variables provided ICC estimates ≥ 0.70 for one week of measurement in any model (ICC = 0.29–0.66 not controlling for season; ICC = 0.49–0.67 when controlling for season). LoA for these models approximated a factor of 1.3–1.7 of the sample PA level standard deviations. Compared to the week-by-week approach, the day-by-day approach resulted in too optimistic reliability estimates (ICC = 0.62–0.77 not controlling for season; ICC = 0.64–0.77 when controlling for season).


Conclusions 
Reliability is lower when analyzed over different seasons and when using a week-by-week approach, than when applying a day-by-day approach and the Spearman Brown prophecy formula to estimate reliability over a short monitoring period.

An update using 3 Tesla MRI.,4,"Rationale and Objectives The aim of this study was to compare different sequences for olfactory bulb volumetry using 3-T magnetic resonance imaging, evaluating reproducibility, repeatability, and systematic biases. Materials and Methods Twenty-two volunteers underwent 3-T magnetic resonance imaging of the frontal skull base in this prospective study. Imaging included constructive interference in steady state (CISS), T2-weighted (T2w) three-dimensional (3D) sampling perfection with application-optimized contrasts using different flip-angle evolutions, and T2w two-dimensional (2D) turbo spin-echo sequences. Two observers independently performed two olfactory bulb volumetric studies per bulb and sequence. Intraobserver and interobserver reliability was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficients. For the evaluation of reproducibility, concordance correlation coefficients were determined, and for repeatability and systematic biases, Bland-Altman plots were analyzed. Results Intraclass correlation coefficient analysis of the specialized observer yielded almost perfect results for intraobserver reliability (0.94, 0.85, and 0.93 for the CISS, T2w 3D, and T2w 2D sequences, respectively). For the less experienced observer, the results were 0.86 0.78, and 0.74 for the CISS, T2w 3D, and T2w 2D sequences, respectively. Interobserver reliability showed almost perfect agreement for all sequences (0.92, 0.86, and 0.86, respectively). The CISS sequence yielded the highest concordance correlation coefficient (0.84), precision (0.85), and accuracy (0.99). Bland-Altman plot analyses revealed the lowest repeatability coefficients for the T2w 2D sequence. Volumetric measurements of T2w 2D imaging showed systematically lower volumetric results compared to the CISS sequence (−22.7%) and the T2w 3D sequence (−8.3%). Conclusions Comparison of three imaging sequences for olfactory bulb volumetry yielded the best values for the CISS sequence in terms of intraobserver and interobserver reliability, reproducibility, accuracy, and precision. Given that even less experienced observers achieve almost perfect results, the CISS sequence is recommended for olfactory bulb volumetry.",WOS:000292066200009,ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY

Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, 22 cases of peri-implant soft tissue with different conditions were selected, and color slides were prepared from them. The slides were shown to periodontists, maxillofacial surgeons, prosthodontists and general dentists, and these professionals were asked to score the images according to the Misch classification and ISI. The intra- and inter-observer reproducibility scores of the viewers were assessed and reported using kappa and weighted kappa (WK) tests. Results: Inter-observer reproducibility of the ISI technique between the prosthodontists-periodontists (WK=0.85), prosthodontists-maxillofacial surgeons (WK=0.86) and periodontists-maxillofacial surgeons (WK=0.9) was better than that between general dentists and other specialists. In the two groups of general dentists and maxillofacial surgeons, ISI was more reproducible than the Misch classification system (WK=0.99 versus WK noncalculable, WK=1 and WK=0.86). The intra-observer reproducibility of both methods was equally excellent among periodontists (WK=1). For prosthodontists, the WK was not calculable via any of the methods. Conclusion: The intra-observer reproducibility of both the ISI and Misch classification techniques depends on the specialty and expertise of the clinician. Although ISI has more classes, it also has higher reproducibility than simpler classifications due to its ability to provide more detail.",WOS:000420512200003,JOURNAL OF THE KOREAN ASSOCIATION OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS

Materials and methods A software enabling AAA segmentation, diameter and volume measurement on computed tomography angiography (CTA) was tested. Validation was conducted in 28 patients with an AAA having 2 consecutive CTA examinations. The segmentation was performed twice by a senior radiologist and once by 3 medical students on all 56 CTAs. Intra and inter-observer reproducibility of D -max and volumes values were calculated by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Systematic errors were evaluated by Bland–Altman analysis. Differences in D -max and volume growth were compared with paired Student's t -tests. Results Mean D -max and volume were 49.6 ± 6.2 mm and 117.2 ± 36.2 ml for baseline and 53.6 ± 7.9 mm and 139.6 ± 56.3 ml for follow-up studies. Volume growth (17.3%) was higher than D -max progression (8.0%) between baseline and follow-up examinations ( p D -max and volume measurements were respectively estimated at 0.997 (≥0.991) and 1.000 (≥0.999). Overall inter-observer ICC of D -max and volume measurements were respectively estimated at 0.995 (0.990–0.997) and 0.999 (>0.999).

This project, being a part of the Open Science and Research Initiative in Finland (ATT), proceeds via two subprojects. First, the platform for editing and publishing OA journals are improved. Second, a new consortium based funding model for Finnish OA journals will be created. Kotilava is closely related to another ATT initiative run by The National Library of Finland, TAJUA, which aims to further improve OA repository services and guidance on best practices that the National Library already provides. It also develops tools for creating metadata for research datasets. This poster focuses on the funding model of Kotilava. Most Finnish academic journals are published in print by small scholarly societies. They have limited resources to carry out all the tasks needed in turning to immediate OA. Yet, this transformation has to happen. Researchers need to see their contribution distributed as soon and as widely as possible; also the funders require the results of the research they finance to be published in OA.   Currently, the most common way of funding OA journals are Article Processing Charges (APCs). The difficulties of this model are well known, two of the major ones being that an APC based model is not appropriate for small language areas like Finland nor for all fields of research. Thus, alternative funding models are discussed worldwide. Especially consortium based systems, such as the Open Library of Humanities’ and Knowledge Unlatched’s models, have been of interest. So far the income of Finnish journals has consisted of sales, subventions from societies, government subsidies, and, occasionally, from subsidies by research institutions. Publishing in immediate OA decreases the income from these conventional sources of funding. Clearly, the transformation to immediate OA cannot be financed without substitutive funding. Domestic journals provide the definitive forum to publish research on national culture, history and society. It is in the best interest of all the actors in the field from research organizations and funders to scholarly publishers to guarantee the existence of these publishing channels also in the future. The aims of Kotilava are: determining the criteria the journals should meet (e.g. technical and bibliographical requirements); calculating the income needed to fund immediate OA; outlining the criteria how an article based fee is determined in different types of journals; negotiating with the possible funders and the journals; and proposing a system for collecting the funds to the consortia and for distributing it to the journals with minimum transaction costs. Tasks 1, 2, and 3 are integrated with the part of Kotilava which aids the journals to meet the technical criteria of OA publishing. During summer 2016, a group of 12 journals has begun to examine the possibilities of creating the new funding model in practice.","",""

An empirical comparative study was conducted to quantify the effects of key component technologies on ARR of four state-of-the-art systems. In particular, the capabilities of the optical and mechanical axes were investigated when they were utilised separately or in combination for precision laser machining. Conclusions are made about the positional accuracy of the mechanical and optical axes and the importance of their proper calibration on the systems’ overall performance is discussed.

Three observers analysed three times 20 radiologic files comprising 2D X-rays, 2D CT scan and 3D reconstructions for the intra-observer study, and an expert committee was used to assess the inter-observer reproducibility. The Kappa coefficient was used to measure agreement. The Kappa coefficient founded poor to moderate agreement for the majority of the criteria after the 2D X-ray analysis. This coefficient was improved with the use of 2D CT scan and 3D reconstructions, in particular for the medial hinge assessment, the humeral head fracture and the metaphyseal extension. The reproducibility of the criteria described by Hertel on 2D X-rays is at least moderate. Reproducibility could be considerably improved by associating 2D scans and 3D reconstruction, in particular for the criteria related to prognosis for the vascularisation of the humeral head.","",""

To assess the repeatability and reproducibility of dynamic corneal response parameters measured by the Corvis ST (Oculus, Wetzlar, Germany). Methods. One eye randomly selected from 32 healthy volunteers was examined by the Corvis ST. Three different devices were used in an alternated random order for taking three measurements at each device in each subject. Standard intraocular pressure (IOP), the biomechanical-compensated IOP (bIOP), and DCR parameters were evaluated. The within-subject standard deviation (ζw) and coefficient of variation (CV) were assessed. Results. Regarding pressure indices, the ζw was below 1 mmHg for repeatability (0.98 for IOP and 0.89 for bIOP) and the CV was 6.6% for IOP and 6.1% for bIOP. For reproducibility, the ζw was around 1 mmHg (1.12 for IOP and 1.05 for bIOP) and the CV was 7.6% for IOP and 7.1% for bIOP. Most of DCR indices presented CV for repeatability below 4%.

In such studies multiple laboratories, 10 or more, compare the performances of reference and test methods at the limit of detection of the methods that is at spiking levels around 1 cfu per analytical portion. A laboratory’s performance is expressed as the number of positive replicates detected per set of six. The data only imply the presence or absence of significant between-laboratory effects with the test method relative to the reference method. It is difficult to parse the observed variability into the contributions of the sample variability and between-laboratory effects. This is because at spiking levels close to 1 cfu per portion it cannot be assured that laboratories are examining portions with equivalent numbers of the target microbe. In this study published data are reformulated to the number of laboratories observing a given number of positive results per replicate set in order to reflect the inhomogeneity of the spike distribution in the replicate portions. A mean spiking level that is less uncertain than the reported 3-tube reference method MPN value is estimated from the pooled proportions of positives that the laboratories obtained with the reference method. The expected distribution of the spike was calculated from its mean value using the binomial equation. The numerical distributions of the laboratories among the 7 possible positive categories (0–6 positives per replicate set) were statistically indistinguishable from the expected binomial distribution thus corroborating this approach. Probable instances of interlaboratory performance differences were detected by further statistical analysis. This analytical approach, as well as transparently reflecting the sampling variability, also suggested ways of improving and simplifying such studies.",WOS:000292672400005,FOOD MICROBIOLOGY

To determine quantitative quality control procedures to evaluate technical variability in multi-center measurements of the diffusion coefficient of water as a prerequisite to use of the biomarker apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) in multi-center clinical trials.



Materials and Methods:

A uniform data acquisition protocol was developed and shared with 18 participating test sites along with a temperature-controlled diffusion phantom delivered to each site. Usable diffusion weighted imaging data of ice water at five b-values were collected on 35 clinical MRI systems from three vendors at two field strengths (1.5 and 3 Tesla [T]) and analyzed at a central processing site.



Results:

Standard deviation of bore-center ADCs measured across 35 scanners was 10%) vendor-specific and system-specific spatial nonuniformity ADC bias was detected for the off-center measurement that was consistent with gradient nonlinearity.



Conclusion:

Standardization of DWI protocol has improved reproducibility of ADC measurements and allowed identifying spatial ADC nonuniformity as a source of error in multi-site clinical studies. J. Magn. Reson.

First, the title is too long, even in acronym form (WWTBTEOAMJ). Second, television viewers prefer shows on which competitors sing or dance, and academic physicians aren’t known for their pipes or mambo skills. The main reason WWTBTEOAMJ is a bad idea, though, is that worthy contestants would be too hard to find.

Editing a major general medical journal is no easy task. To succeed, a person must be open-minded and innovative, intelligent and media savvy, patient and thick-skinned. Finding someone with the requisite skills and knowledge can be challenging, as a search team at CMAJ will soon discover, having been assigned to find a replacement for the journal’s current editor-in-chief, Dr. Paul Hebert, who will be leaving his position sometime this year (www.cmaj.ca/cgi/doi/10.1503/cmaj.109-3769).

“An editor is a leader,” says Dr. Richard Smith, former BMJ editor-in-chief. “There are two things that a leader needs. The first is vision. What is it that we are trying to do here? Leaders don’t have to set the agenda entirely by themselves but are responsible for making sure there is some kind of vision — more than just getting the journal out every week and just ticking along. Secondly, they need an ability to inspire people with that vision and get them pointed in the same direction.”

Successful editors implement their visions and give their journals unique voices, while maintaining a sense of impartiality. Former New England Journal of Medicine editor-in-chief Dr. Jerome Kassirer once wrote that striking this balance is difficult (N Engl J Med 1999;340:1671–2): “Medical journal editors walk a fine line. They must aspire to impartiality, open-mindedness, and intellectual honesty. They must try to select material for its merit, interest to readers, and originality alone. They also want their journals to have a voice and a personality. If they are doing their jobs well, they should give no favors, and they should have no friends.”







Finding someone with all of the qualities necessary to be an editor-in-chief-cum-super-hero can be tricky.

The editor of a medical journal must also be experienced in critically appraising scientific articles, a skill that requires constant honing, says Smith, whose 13-year term as editor of BMJ ended in 2004. Good writing and public speaking skills are also essential, as are creativity and boldness. “A sense of boldness and a thick skin are important,” says Smith, now CEO of the European arm of UnitedHealth Group, a private US health care organization. “A journal sometimes has to speak truth to power and that’s going to be uncomfortable.”

One of an editor’s most critical skills, if a medical journal is to be successful, is the ability to identify and nurture talent. “Any journal that can’t be better than its editor is doomed,” says Smith. “The way to make a good journal is to find good people and give them space to do interesting things.”

In the United Kingdom, medical journals tend to pick editors from within their ranks, or people who at least have experience working for a scientific journal. By contrast, journals in the United States have a tradition of awarding the top job to distinguished academics, says Smith. One European medical journal, Smith recalls, had a joint editorship model: one editor with a journal background to handle day-to-day operations, another with impressive academic credentials to set strategic directions. The model has also been successfully adopted by several specialty journals.

This is similar to the co-CEO model in the business world, which has been used by companies such as financial giants Charles Schwab and Citigroup, and also technology leaders Motorola and Research In Motion. “The co-CEO model can work in a culture where cooperation and consensus are highly valued, and where command and control is not,” Joshua Greenbaum, an industry analyst and head of California-based Enterprise Applications Consulting, writes in an email.

Still, corporate co-leadership remains somewhat of an enigma, working well under some circumstances and not so well under others, says Steven Dennis, Aarestad Chair of Banking in the College of Business & Public Administration at the University of North Dakota.

“Co-CEOs that arise from co-founders seem to work very well and sometimes last for decades. Research in Motion, a Canadian company, has performed very well with co-CEOs,” Dennis, the lead author of a paper exploring the co-CEO model (J Bus Econ Stud 2009;15:1–25), writes in an email. “Other co-CEO arrangements arise from mergers and acquisitions, and those tend not to last very long. Still other co-CEO arrangements arise from ‘passing the torch’ to two siblings, and the success of those relationships is sketchy at best.”

Wherever hopeful editor-in-chief candidates spend the majority of their careers, it is important that they have a traceable — and successful — track record, says Dr. George Lundberg, editor-in-chief of the Journal of the American Medical Association from 1982 to 1999. “The person should have name recognition in the medical community. It shouldn’t be some dark horse who shows up unknown.”

There are many other critically important characteristics that a person should possess to be considered for a position running a major international medical journal, says Lundberg, now editor-in-chief of Cancer Commons, which promotes using open science to help cancer patients tailor care to their needs (http://cancercommons.org). These characteristics include high intellect, broad medical knowledge, high ethical standards, sensitivity of the needs of journal staff, strategic planning skills, comfort with technology, a gift for public relations and a commitment to improving public health.

“Once an editor is chosen who has all these characteristics, this person must be willing to learn how to be an editor. They must be cautious and modest about their capacity to be successful on day one, and be willing to learn on the job,” says Lundberg.

“It’s a very complicated job, encompassing the whole field of medicine, as well as public health, ethics and also business, because money has to come from somewhere,” adds Lundberg. “It is almost impossible to find someone who excels in all these areas. You find someone who has these qualities and excels in as many areas as possible.”",WOS:000287972500021,CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION JOURNAL

The first step must be to study the characteristics of these devices in terms of accuracy and reliability of the most commonly used landmarks. The aims were 1- To assess intra and inter-observer reliability in the location of anatomical landmarks belonging to hard tissues of the skull in images taken with a CBCT device, 2- To determine which of those landmarks are more vs. less reliable and 3- To introduce planes of reference so as to create cephalometric analyses appropriated to the 3D reality. Study design: Fifteen patients who had a CBCT (i-CAT®) as a diagnostic register were selected. To assess the reproducibility on landmark location and the differences in the measurements of two observers at different times, 41 landmarks were defined on the three spatial axes (X,Y,Z) and located. 3.690 measurements were taken and, as each determination has 3 coordinates, 11.070 data were processed with SPSS® statistical package. To discover the reproducibility of the method on landmark location, an ANOVA was undertaken using two variation factors: time (t1, t2 and t3) and observer (Ob1 and Ob2) for each axis (X, Y and Z) and landmark. The order of the CBCT scans submitted to the observers (Ob1, Ob2) at t1, t2, and t3, were different and randomly allocated. Multiple comparisons were undertaken using the Bonferroni test. The intra- and inter-examiner ICC´s were calculated. Results: Intra- and inter-examiner reliability was high, both being ICC ≥ 0.99, with the best frequency on axis Z. Conclusions: The most reliable landmarks were: Nasion, Sella, Basion, left Porion, point A, anterior nasal spine, Pogonion, Gnathion, Menton, frontozygomatic sutures, first lower molars and upper and lower incisors. Those with less reliability were the supraorbitals, right zygion and posterior nasal spine.

This study aimed to investigate the performance of healthy young subjects’ standing posture on the BalancAid compared to standing on the ground mimicking the standard X-rays posture in producing a reproducible posture for the spinal X-ray radiography. A study on the posture reproducibility measurement was performed by taking photographs of 20 healthy young subjects with good balance control standing on the BalancAid and the ground repeatedly within two consecutive days.

No body marks repositioning was performed to avoid any error. Lin’s CCC test on all angles comparing both standing postures demonstrated that seven out of nine angles in PA view, and two out of three angles in LA view gave better reproducibility for standing on the BalancAid compared to standing on the ground.

In addition to highlighting the need for universities to fully recognise the achievements of teaching staff, we discuss the role that the various biosciences learned societies have in supporting Teaching-Focussed academics. We identify that there is a need for the learned societies to come together and pool their expertise in this area. The fragmented nature of the Teaching-Focussed academic community means that clear sources of national support are needed in order to best enable the next generation of bioscience educators to reach their full potential.","",""

We aimed to analyze the validity and reproducibility of the dietary patterns defined by cluster analysis derived from a food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). We hypothesized that the dietary patterns derived by cluster analysis have fair to modest reproducibility and validity. Dietary data were collected from 107 individuals from population-based survey, by an FFQ at baseline (FFQ1) and after 1 year (FFQ2), and by twelve 24-hour dietary recalls (24-HDR). Repeatability and validity were measured by comparing clusters obtained by the FFQ1 and FFQ2 and by the FFQ2 and 24-HDR (reference method), respectively. Cluster analysis identified a \"fruits & vegetables\" and a \"meat\" pattern in each dietary data source. Cluster membership was concordant for 66.7% of participants in FFQ1 and FFQ2 (reproducibility), and for 67.0% in FFQ2 and 24-HDR (validity). Spearman correlation analysis showed reasonable reproducibility, especially in the \"fruits & vegetables\" pattern, and lower validity also especially in the \"fruits & vegetables\" pattern. κ statistic revealed a fair validity and reproducibility of clusters.

We were curious whether the published literature, which is dominated by positive results, reflects the experience of researchers using EBS. Specifically, we wanted to know whether researchers are able to reproduce published EBS effects and whether they engage in, but fail to report, questionable research practices. We invited 976 researchers to complete an online survey. We also audited 100 randomly-selected published EBS papers. A total of 154 researchers completed the survey. Survey respondents had a median of 3 [1 to 6, IQR] published EBS papers (1180 total) and 2 [1 to 3] unpublished ones (380 total). With anodal and cathodal EBS, the two most widely used techniques, 45–50% of researchers reported being able to routinely reproduce published results. When asked about how study sample size was determined, 69% of respondents reported using the sample size of published studies, while 61% had used power calculations, and 32% had based their decision on pilot data. In contrast, our audit found only 6 papers where power calculations were used and a single paper in which pilot data was used. When asked about questionable research practices, survey respondents were aware of other researchers who selectively reported study outcomes (41%) and experimental conditions (36%), adjusted statistical analysis to optimise results (43%), and engaged in other shady practices (20%). Fewer respondents admitted to engaging in these practices themselves, although 25% admitted to adjusting statistical analysis to optimize results. There was strong agreement that such practices should be reported in research papers; however, our audit found only two such admissions. The present survey confirms that questionable research practices and poor reproducibility are present in EBS studies.

To assess the T1ρ and T2 values in the hip cartilage of healthy volunteers and to evaluate the reproducibility of these measurements.

Materials and Methods
The right hip joint of 30 asymptomatic volunteers was explored with 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Quantitative 3D T1ρ- and T2-maps sequences were repeated twice with a 30-minute delay (immediate reproducibility). The same protocol was repeated 14 days later (short-term reproducibility). Immediate and short-term reproducibility were estimated using coefficients of variation and correlation concordance coefficients (CCC). The precisions of the measurements were estimated by the ratio of the standard deviations. A mixed linear model was used to analyze the effect of patient's characteristics on T1ρ and T2 values.

Results
Immediate reproducibility was significantly better than short-term reproducibility for T1ρ (CCC of 0.75 versus 0.55; P = 0.007) and T2 (CCC 0.65 versus 0.32; P < 0.001). The precisions of the measurements were estimated between 5.5% and 9.1%. Median T1ρ values were 6.0 msec higher in women than in men (P = 0.006), with no significant influence of age, body mass index (BMI), or sports activity. Median T2 values were not significantly different between men and women (0.4 msec lower in women; P = 0.76). There was no significant influence of age, BMI, or sports activity. T1ρ and T2 values were lower in lateral regions than in medial regions (4.9 msec and 2.5 msec lower respectively; P < 0.0001).

Conclusion
Immediate reproducibility of T1ρ and T2 values is better than short-term, with limited effect of 30 minutes decubitus. T1ρ values are significantly higher in women.

Reproducibility is one of the core principles for any scientific workflow and remains a challenge, which is not fully addressed. This is due to incomplete understanding of reproducibility requirements and assumptions of workflow definition approaches. Provenance information should be tracked and used to capture all these requirements supporting reusability of existing workflows. Results We have implemented a complex but widely deployed bioinformatics workflow using three representative approaches to workflow definition and execution. Through implementation, we identified assumptions implicit in these approaches that ultimately produce insufficient documentation of workflow requirements resulting in failed execution of the workflow. This study proposes a set of recommendations that aims to mitigate these assumptions and guides the scientific community to accomplish reproducible science, hence addressing reproducibility crisis. Conclusions Reproducing, adapting or even repeating a bioinformatics workflow in any environment requires substantial technical knowledge of the workflow execution environment, resolving analysis assumptions and rigorous compliance with reproducibility requirements. Towards these goals, we propose conclusive recommendations that along with an explicit declaration of workflow specification would result in enhanced reproducibility of computational genomic analyses.",WOS:000406607500001,BMC BIOINFORMATICS

Design and methods: From a subsample of 258 children who participated in the IDEFICS baseline examination, parental questionnaires of the CEHQ were collected twice to assess reproducibility of questionnaire results from 0 to 354 days after the first examination. Weighted Cohen's kappa coefficients (κ) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (r) were calculated to assess agreement between the first and second questionnaires for each food item of the CEHQ-FFQ. Stratification was performed for sex, age group, geographical region and length of period between the first and second administrations. Fisher's Z transformation was applied to test correlation coefficients for significant differences between strata.
Results: For all food items analysed, weighted Cohen's kappa coefficients (κ) and Spearman's correlation coefficients (r) were significant and positive (P 128 days) between the first and second administrations resulted in a generally lower, yet still acceptable, reproducibility.

The measurement of mucociliary transport velocity by rhinoscintigraphy with Tc-99m-macroaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA) is reliable measure of mucociliary clearance. The aim of this study is to assess the intratest, interobserver, and intraobserver reproducibility of nasal mucociliary transport rate (NMTR) measurement. Materials and Methods. Twenty-two subjects were evaluated to determine intratest reproducibility and a group of 35 subjects was examined to determine inter- and intraobserver reproducibility. Rhinoscintigraphy with 99mTc-MAA was used to measure NMTR in all study subjects. Paired NMTR measurements were compared using a range of statistical methodologies. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and repeatability coefficients and Bland-Altman plots were applied to assess the degree of intratest, interobserver, and intraobserver variation. Results. Statistical analysis of test and retest experiments demonstrated the statistical equivalence of intratest NMTR measurements, interobserver NMTR measurements, and intraobserver NMTR measurements. The intratest ICC, interobserver ICC, and intraobserver ICC were 0.96, 0.83, and 0.91, respectively, indicating that intratest and intraobserver reproducibility are excellent and interobserver reproducibility is good. Conclusions. Rhinoscintigraphy using 99mTc-MAA results in highly reproducible measurement of NMTR. The use of radionuclide imaging in measuring NMTR results in excellent intratest and intraobserver reproducibility and good interobserver reliability.",WOS:000215854600070,SCIENTIFICA

A total of 3 trials of 7 meters distance each were conducted. Plantar pressure analysis was carried out using a novel approach of masking the recordings into 10 different areas; both peak pressure (PP) and pressure time integrals (PTI) values were investigated. The PP and PTI were investigated for the left, right and both feet analysed together. Interclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC) test was adopted for statistical analysis. Overall, 30 healthy children were recruited and 60 appointments were completed; 53.3% (n = 16) were female, mean age was 13.3 years (SD = 4.5). Results highlighted that overall the ICC for repeatability was > 0.75 for 95.8% (no = 115) and between 0.5 and 0.75 for 4.2% (no = 5); the ICC for reproducibility was > 0.75 for 85% (no = 51), and between 0.5 and 0.75 for 15% (no = 9).

For example, the Reproducibility Project, a large-scale replication attempt of 100 studies published in top psychology journals found that only 39% could be unambiguously reproduced. There is a growing consensus among scientists that the lack of reproducibility in psychology and other fields stems from various methodological factors, including low statistical power, researcher’s degrees of freedom, and an emphasis on publishing surprising positive results. However, there is a contentious debate about the extent to which failures to reproduce certain results might also reflect contextual differences (often termed “hidden moderators”) between the original research and the replication attempt. Although psychologists have found extensive evidence that contextual factors alter behavior, some have argued that context is unlikely to influence the results of direct replications precisely because these studies use the same methods as those used in the original research. To help resolve this debate, we recoded the 100 original studies from the Reproducibility Project on the extent to which the research topic of each study was contextually sensitive. Results suggested that the contextual sensitivity of the research topic was associated with replication success, even after statistically adjusting for several methodological characteristics (e.g., statistical power, effect size). The association between contextual sensitivity and replication success did not differ across psychological subdisciplines. These results suggest that researchers, replicators, and consumers should be mindful of contextual factors that might influence a psychological process. We offer several guidelines for dealing with contextual sensitivity in reproducibility.",WOS:000377155400041,PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

Research has shown that measuring the flexural stiffness of asphalt mixture beams using a bending beam rheometer (BBR) is a good way to control the low temperature properties of asphalt mixtures. However, before such a test is adopted as a specification, the repeatability and reproducibility of the testing protocol need to be verified. This study uses the draft American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials protocol established by Marasteanu et al. to evaluate the variability of results from two separate laboratories, one at the University of Utah and one at the Utah Department of Utah central laboratory. The purpose of this research is to examine the reproducibility of test results across different laboratories. A series of gyratory asphalt mixture samples were examined based on mixture designs from Utah highways; each of the samples was cut into thin asphalt mixture beams and divided evenly between the two laboratories. Each set of tests shared the same variables for both laboratories and were conducted on the same day. The testing was performed at a temperature of -18°C, which corresponds to the low temperature performance grade plus 10°C. One variable was altered between each pair of tests, namely the amount of time between cutting of the gyratory asphalt mixture sample and running of the test. The variations in time conducted after cutting included four intervals: two days, three days, one week, and two weeks after cutting, which highlight the effects of any steric hardening for both short and long periods on the repeatability of results. The results of these tests demonstrated consistency across both laboratories. These results also indicate that steric hardening has no effect on testing samples after 48 hours and that the test results are repeatable for the same asphalt mixture specimen. Therefore, the BBR test can be used as a low-temperature specification for asphalt mixtures.","",""

This study evaluated the intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of the dual-stain biomarker, CINtec® PLUS cytology in ThinPrep® specimens, for improved specificity in the detection of cervical disease in women testing human papillomavirus (HPV) positive.

Methods
A total of 972 cases of HPV-positive women from a triage and primary HPV screening population were selected from an ongoing study evaluating the clinical performance of CINtec® PLUS cytology. For reproducibility analyses, three cytotechnologists rescreened sets of slides which they had previously reported themselves and which were previously reported by each of the other cytotechnologists. The original results of slides previously screened by each of the three cytotechnologists were also compared with the results of an expert reference evaluator.

Results
Intra- and inter-observer agreement for paired evaluations between reviewers ranged from 82.8% to 94.9% (kappa 0.65-0.91) and 89.2% to 93% (kappa 0.83-0.88), respectively. Reproducibility analyses between the cytotechnologists and the reference evaluator revealed agreements ranging from 95.5% to 98% (kappa 0.89-0.96).

Conclusion
Evaluation of the dual-stain biomarker showed a high level of agreement across all evaluators suggesting that CINtec® PLUS cytology will perform well in the hands of cytotechnologists and pathologist reviewers and could be introduced into cellular pathology laboratories that employ ThinPrep® LBC with a minimum effort.",WOS:000406473100006,CYTOPATHOLOGY

HIRMEOS will work on innovative services on identification, entities recognition, annotation, and altmetrics, using when possible common standards. These standards are well established in journal publishing, however not common enough yet in book publishing to pave the way for deeper linking of book and journal content or crosslinking of references, entities or usage. HIRMEOS is based upon 5 Open Access book-publishing platforms, OpenEdition Books, OAPEN Library, EKT Open Book Press, Ubiquity Press and Gottingen University Press. During the run of the project these platforms integrate tools for identification, authentication and interoperability (DOI, ORCID, Fundref), for additional information and entity extraction (INRIA (N)ERD), the ability to annotate monographs (Hypothes.is), and gather usage and alternative metric data. HIRMEOS will also enrich the technical capacities of the Directory of Open Access Books (DOAB), a most significant indexing service for open access monographs globally, to receive automated information for ingestion, while it will also develop a structured certification system to document monograph peer-review.  The project consortium will develop shared minimum standards for their monograph publications, such that allow the full embedding of technologies and content in the European Science Cloud. Finally, the project will have a catalyst effect in including more disciplines into the Open Science paradigm, widening its boundaries towards the SSH.

Aims and Objectives: An attempt was made here to standardize the criteria on which the grades would be given and designate it as Sign Grading System. Along with this, the objective of this paper was to evaluate whether this index/system satisfies all the requirements of an ideal index, particularly reliability and reproducibility. Settings and Design: Inter-examiner and intra-examiner reliability and reproducibility of this index was assessed through a randomized clinical study. Patients were recruited from an institutional setting by random selection from the outpatient department. Materials and Methods: One month of training was conducted before the actual start of study. The clinical aspect of the study involved 3 investigators and 50 patients of whom 45 patients were reassessed. All the data were kept blind by a research assistant to reduce bias. Necessary measures were taken to reduce/eliminate the confounding variables, which could have affected the outcome of this study.

Research in SB and Gx depends on the use of collections of tissue and data, commonly known as bioresources. Substantial amounts of time and money are being spent on creating these bioresources and it is likely that significant scientific breakthroughs and development of end-products may be missed or delayed if the tissue and data in these resources are not shared. Accordingly, the ‘openness’ of these bioresources — in other words, the ability for other researchers to access, use, and share these resources (which is typically recorded in a bioresource’s IP and access policy) — is a key issue for the success of bioresource initiatives and the progress of SB and Gx. There are, however, many different approaches to openness, and the development and dissemination of new knowledge are not necessarily advanced by distributing material at low cost or without any restrictions; time-limited rights of control (e.g. IP rights) may provide a useful incentive. It is a significant challenge to develop a fit-for-purpose openness policy that balances the advantages (and disadvantages) of different approaches to openness. The Workshop addressed this challenge by: reviewing openness policies adopted by large bioresources; eliciting ideas about access and intellectual property; debating the applicability of different openness policies; and identifying relevant areas for future research.","",""

Cultural equivalence of POSAS-I with the English version was confirmed. The validation study included 102 subjects with surgical scars. Both subscales demonstrated acceptable internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0·72–0·80). Reproducibility of the OSAS-I (ICCs = 0·93–0·94; SEM = 1·8 points; MDC95 = 5·1 points) was superior to that of PSAS-I (ICC = 0·65; SEM = 5·7 points; MDC95 = 15·7 points). OSAS-I showed moderate to good correlations with the Vancouver Scar Scale (VSS), Global Rating of Change Scale (GRCS) and PSAS-I. Sensitivity to change was large for PSAS-I (effect size = 1·08; standardised response mean = 0·96) and moderate to large for OSAS-I (ES = 0·69; SRM = 0·92).

This paper introduced the way to estimate the relative error in 2D correlation spectroscopy, especially focused on the possible source of errors that may arise from the limitation of experimental reproducibility. Mainly two sources of reproducibility are examined. The first is the reproducibility of the performance of experimental apparatus, in which the baseline drift as well as the noise level of spectroscopic measurements are taken into consideration. The maximum intensities of the 2D correlation maps obtained by the measurement of a series of small fluctuations of baselines are typically only in the order of 10 −5 and 10 −7 , respectively, for synchronous or asynchronous spectra, which are so small that their effect can be safely ignored. Meanwhile, the 2D correlation maps based purely on the experimental noise can also be constructed, which provides the threshold above which any correlation can be treated as meaningful. The second source of relative error is caused by the reproducibility of the experimental condition. The most commonly used perturbations for generalized 2D correlation spectroscopy are concentration and temperature. Therefore, the effect of the reproducibility of the concentration of each sample prepared, as well as the small variation of the temperature during the measurement, which may all give rise to relative error, was examined. A quantitative measure of the extent of relative error caused by this kind of reproducibility can also be analyzed by using 2D correlation maps.","",""

Since 2012, when scientists from Amgen reported that they were able to reproduce only 6 of 53 'landmark' preclinical studies, the biomedical research community began discussing the scale of the reproducibility problem and developing initiatives to address critical challenges. GBSI released the 'Case for Standards' in 2013, one of the first comprehensive reports to address the rising concern of irreproducible biomedical research. Further attention was drawn to issues that limit scientific self-correction including reporting and publication bias, underpowered studies, lack of open access to methods and data, and lack of clearly defined standards and guidelines in areas such as reagent validation. To evaluate the progress made towards reproducibility since 2013, GBSI identified and examined initiatives designed to advance quality and reproducibility. Through this process, we identified key roles for funders, journals, researchers and other stakeholders and recommended actions for future progress. This paper describes our findings and conclusions.","",""

It begins by sketching current issues in Brexit debates at the end of 2016 as the context into which discussions about open access are then placed. Issues in four thematic areas are analysed: OA policies and mandates, EU copyright reform, new OA publishing models and open science. The level of dependence in the UK on European developments is assessed in each case and its contribution to Brexit issues identified. The paper concludes that Brexit presents not only challenges, but also opportunities which the UK could seize. In open access, the UK is already playing a leadership role. In areas of open science, particularly in relation to the European Open Science Cloud, it is the European Commission which is asserting leadership. The UK needs to consolidate its current activity and ensure that, whatever the nature of Brexit arrangements, its freedom does not lead to isolation.",WOS:000409192300002,INSIGHTS-THE UKSG JOURNAL

Methods The participants were 30 Chinese adults (ages, 23-28 years) who had normal occlusion with no history of orthodontic therapy, maxillofacial trauma, or surgery. The natural head position was acquired using the self-balanced, mirror, and estimated positions, which were performed in duplicate and repeated after 1 week. Three-dimensional photographs were recorded with a horizontal laser line projected onto the face. The laser lines were observed by registering the repeated 3-dimensional photographs. The roll and pitch of the head orientation were measured with a digital ruler. Reproducibility was calculated using Dahlberg's formula and the Bland–Altman method. Results The reproducibility values calculated with Dahlberg's formula were 1.51°, 1.2°, and 0.99° for pitch, and 0.78°, 0.76°, and 0.41° for roll in the self-balanced, mirror, and estimated positions, respectively. Conclusions The 3 methods are reproducible for both pitch and roll, and the estimated position showed the best reproducibility among these methods.

In the current study, however, we showed that 77% of the replication effect sizes reported were within a 95% prediction interval calculated using the original effect size. Our analysis suggests two critical issues in understanding replication of psychological studies. First, researchers’ intuitive expectations for what a replication should show do not always match with statistical estimates of replication. Second, when the results of original studies are very imprecise, they create wide prediction intervals—and a broad range of replication effects that are consistent with the original estimates.

I then briefly review several mechanisms through which replicability can be undermined in research, and some of the proposals for addressing these issues.

Open Science is ‘the movement to make scientific research, data and dissemination accessible to all levels of an inquiring society’.

In the spirit of the Open Science movement, advance publication of protocols for clinical trials is now being advocated by BioMed Central, BMJ Open and others.

Whilst access to protocols alongside published trial findings has clear benefits, advance publication of trial protocols is potentially problematic for trials of complex behavioural interventions. In this article we explain, with examples, how this could lead to unblinding, ‘contamination’ between intervention and control groups and deliberate biasing of assessment outcomes by participants.

For a statistical forensic evaluation method to be repeatable, it needs to generate consistent log-likelihood ratios for various sample size ratios between the genuine (mated) and imposter (non-mated) scores from the same database. It is a well known fact, that for logistic regression methods, the estimated intercept value depends on the sample size ratio between the two groups. Therefore, when computing log-likelihood ratios using logistic regression estimation, different genuine and impostor sample size ratios could result in different log-likelihood ratio values.

To examine the quality of methods used and the accuracy of the interpretation of agreement in existing studies that examine the reliability of ultrasound measurements and judgments in obstetrics and gynecology.



Methods

A systematic search of MEDLINE was performed on 25 March 2014, looking for studies that examined the reliability of ultrasound measurements and judgments in obstetrics and gynecology with evaluation of concordance (CCC) or intraclass (ICC) correlation coefficients or kappa as a main objective.



Results

Seven hundred and thirty-three records were examined on the basis of their title and abstract, of which 141 full-text articles were examined completely for eligibility. We excluded 29 studies because they did not report CCC/ICC/kappa, leaving 112 studies that were included in our analysis. Two studies reported both ICC and kappa and were counted twice, therefore, the number used as the denominator in the analyses was 114. Only 16/114 (14.0%) studies were considered to be well designed (independent acquisition and blinded analysis) and to have interpreted the results properly. Most errors occurring in the studies are likely to overestimate the reliability of the method examined.



Conclusions

The vast majority of published studies examined had important flaws in design, interpretation and/or reporting. Such limitations are important to identify as they might create false confidence in the existing measurements and judgments, jeopardizing clinical practice and future research. Specific guidelines aimed at improving the quality of reproducibility studies that examine ultrasound methods should be encouraged. Copyright © 2014 ISUOG.

An exploratory survey among Harvard bioscientists.,2,"Basic research in the biomedical field generates both knowledge that has a value per se regardless of its possible practical outcome and knowledge that has the potential to produce more practical benefits. Policies can increase the benefit potential to society of basic biomedical research by offering various kinds of incentives to basic researchers. In this paper we argue that soft incentives or “nudges” are particularly promising. However, to be well designed, these incentives must take into account the motivations, goals and views of the basic scientists. In the paper we present the results of an investigation that involved more than 300 scientists at Harvard Medical School and affiliated institutes. The results of this study suggest that some soft incentives could be valuable tools to increase the transformative value of fundamental investigations without affecting the spirit of the basic research and scientists’ work satisfaction. After discussing the findings, we discuss a few examples of nudges for basic researchers in the biomedical fields.","",""

The objective we set out in this paper is to place scientific workflows in the context of reproducibility. To do so, we define several kinds of repro-ducibility that can be reached when scientific workflows are used to perform experiments. We characterize and define the criteria that need to be catered for by reproducibility-friendly scientific workflow systems, and use such criteria to place several representative and widely used workflow systems and companion tools within such a framework. We also discuss the remaining challenges posed by reproducible scientific workflows in the life sciences.

In preparation for longitudinal analyses of white matter development in youths with family histories of substance use disorders (FH+) or without such histories (FH−), we examined the reproducibility and reliability of global and regional measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) values, measured using the Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics Through Meta Analysis (ENIGMA)-diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) protocol. Highly reliable measures are necessary to detect any subtle differences in brain development.

Methods
First, we analyzed reproducibility data in a sample of 12 healthy young adults (ages 20–28) imaged three times within a week. Next, we calculated the same metrics in data collected 1-year apart in the sample of 68 FH+ and 21 FH− adolescents. This is a timeframe where within subject changes in white matter microstructure are small compared to between subject variance. Reproducibility was estimated by examining mean coefficients of variation (MCV), mean absolute differences (MAD), and intraclass correlations (ICC) for global and tract-specific FA values.

Results
We found excellent reproducibility for whole-brain DTI-FA values and most of the white matter tracts, except for the corticospinal tract and the fornix in both adults and youths. There was no significant effect of FH-group on reproducibility (p = .4). Reproducibility metrics were not significantly different between adolescents and adults (all p > .2). In post hoc analyses, the reproducibility metrics for regional FA values showed a strong positive correlation (r = .6) with the regional FA heritability measures previously reported by ENIGMA-DTI.

Conclusion
Overall, this study demonstrated an excellent reproducibility of ENIGMA-DTI FA, positing it as viable analysis tools for longitudinal studies and other protocols that repeatedly assess white matter microstructure.",WOS:000395630900011,BRAIN AND BEHAVIOR

Now I believe that the quality of each scientific article is guaranteed by the several features: originality, accuracy, interest, significance, comprehensibility, and reproducibility. The peer-review process by the specialists for every submitted article should well function to authorize its quality. Unfortunately, however, the author’s intentional or accidental ‘‘insincerity’’ sometimes goes through the severe eyes of reviewers. There may be various reasons for it, but we can partly blame it for the interdiscipline of the research because the specialist cannot often cover the wide range of topics or technics in it. I believe that the interdisciplinary studies strongly contribute to make progress of that field, and then Population Ecology should seriously tackle this problem. I consider that a journal editor has some responsibility in judging the validity of the content of the articles. Thus we use CrossCheck powered by iThenticate to prevent the plagiarism in the submitted articles. This service provides us the information how much the sentences of the manuscript matches the database including a large amount of published research articles, conference proceedings and e-books, and highlights which part of the manuscript matches those database. We find it much useful to detect the plagiarism, and indeed we have decided to reject a manuscript recognized as containing plagiarism, but sometimes asked the authors to paraphrase the sentences for innocent cases.

We request to add a citation to the first paragraph of Introduction, as “studies of gene expression and function in the brain were restricted to a relatively small number of genes (Luo and Geschwind, 2001; Zhang et al., 2002; Okaty et al., 2011),” given that this points was recently reviewed in the Okaty et al., paper. More importantly, we have made a mistake in quoting sentence from Okray et al., without quotation or citation. We wish to change the following sentence:

Moreover, as previously discussed by Okaty et al., “gene expression may be regulated in opposing directions in different cell types, thereby appearing static in composite data (Okaty et al., 2011).”

MRI-GCM20 runs simulated data over annual maximum regional-mean 10-day precipitation better than 1-day. Precipitation and return values estimated by MRI-GCM20 were quite different from those by MRI-RCM20. Among the three MRI-GCM20 runs, one forced by SST without year-to-year variability estimated the standard deviation of the annual maximum precipitation as smaller than those forced by SST with year-to-year variability. The reproducibility of the average and standard deviation of the annual maximum precipitation is correlated with the reproducibility of 30-year return values.","",""

Objective: To evaluate left ventricular mass reproducibility when assessed at acquisition (online) compared to when assessed at a reading center after electronic transmission (offline) and also when assessed by different readers at the reading center. Methods: Echocardiographers from the 6 ELSA-Brasil study investigation centers measured the left ventricular mass online during the acquisition from 124 studies before transmitting to the reading center, where studies were read according to the study protocol. Half of these studies were blindly read by a second reader in the reading center. Results: From the 124 echocardiograms, 5 (4%) were considered not measurable. Among the remaining 119, 72 (61%) were women, mean age was 50.2 ± 7.0 years and 2 had structural myocardial abnormalities. Images were considered to be optimal/ good by the reading center for 110 (92.4%) cases. No significant difference existed between online and offline measurements (1,29 g, CI 95% −3.60-6.19), and the intraclass correlation coefficient between them was 0.79 (CI 95% 0.71-0.85). For images read by two readers, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.86 (CI 95% 0.78-0.91). Conclusion: There were no significant drifts between online and offline left ventricular mass measurements, and reproducibility was similar to that described in previous studies.

Geoscience is one of the first domains that take lead in initiatives such as open data, open code, open access, and open collections, which comprise key topics of Open Science in academia. The meaning of being open can be understood at two levels. The lower level is to make data, code, sample collections and publications, etc. freely accessible online and allow reuse, modification and sharing. The higher level is the annotation and connection between those resources to establish a network for collaborative scientific research. In the data science component of the Deep Carbon Observatory (DCO), we have leveraged state-of-the-art information technologies and existing online resources to deploy a web portal for the over 1000 researchers in the DCO community. An initial aim of the portal is to keep track of all research and outputs related to the DCO community. Further, we intend for the portal to establish a knowledge network, which supports various stages of an open scientific process within and beyond the DCO community. Annotation and linking are the key characteristics of the knowledge network. Not only are key assets, including DCO data and methods, published in an open and inter-linked fashion, but the people, organizations, groups, grants, projects, samples, field sites, instruments, software programs, activities, meetings, etc. are recorded and connected to each other through relationships based on well-defined, formal conceptual models. The network promotes collaboration among DCO participants, improves the openness and reproducibility of carbon-related research, facilitates accreditation to resource contributors, and eventually stimulates new ideas and findings in deep carbon-related studies.","",""

A deeper investigation of Sraffa’s price equations reveals that this characterization is not well grounded. The notion of ‘viability’ of a system is thus re-defined here in such a way as to allow the determination of production prices for economies that are not in a self-replacing state (i.e. displaying positive net products in some industries and negative net products in others). Viability is here connected to the possibility for each industry to reintegrate the value of the means of production and to obtain a uniform non-negative rate of profit. It appears, thus, as a notion that mainly impacts the value side. This specification is relevant for an approach where the quantities are determined separately from the relations between value and income distribution. The focus on non-self-replacing systems opens the question on how to handle this and all cases of systematic changes in output levels without losing the property of persistence of production prices, which permits them to be regarded as centres of gravitation. This issue is explicitly linked to possible specific assumptions that can be made on returns. The various views on this point are discussed here in relation to the main features of the modern classical approach.","",""

The present in vitro study analysed segmental 3D motion of the atlanto-axial joint during manual axial rotation mobilization. Twenty fresh frozen human cervical specimens were studied in a test–retest situation with two examiners. The specimens were manually mobilized using three different techniques: (1) a regional mobilization technique of the cervical spine; (2) a segmental mobilization technique of the atlas with manual fixation of the axis; and (3) a segmental mobilization of the atlas on the axis applying a locking technique. Segmental atlanto-axial kinematics was registered with a Zebris CMS-20 ultrasound-based tracking system. The Euclidian norm was used as a representation of overall 3D motion. The results indicated good reproducibility (mean intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC: 0.87). Intraobserver reproducibility was slightly higher (mean ICC: 0.91; range: 0.76–0.99) than interobserver reproducibility (mean ICC: 0.85; range: 0.56–0.98) (P < 0.05). The total range of motion expressed as the Euclidean norm of 3D motion components was a parameter with good reproducibility in the study of segmental kinematics of manual atlanto-axial mobilization.

To evaluate the reproducibility of multicomponent quantitative T2 (QT2) measurements, in particular the myelin water fraction (MWF), to determine the sensitivity of this method for monitoring myelin changes in longitudinal studies and to provide a basis for correctly powering such studies.



Materials and Methods:

The de facto standard 32-echo spin–echo imaging sequence was used throughout, and data were analyzed using regularized non-negative least squares (NNLS) to produce T2 distributions. Three studies were conducted in healthy subjects. First, two acquisition protocols were compared in 10 subjects. Second, variability of QT2 was evaluated over same-day scan–rescan experiments in 6 subjects. Finally, variability was quantified in a longitudinal study of 5 subjects.



Results:

A within-subject coefficient of variation (CoV) of 12% (range 4–25%) was observed for the MWF in brain white matter (WM) regions of interest (ROIs). The geometric mean T2 was more stable, with a longitudinal CoV of 4% (range 1–6%). The choice of the geometry and repetition time of the acquisition protocol influenced the estimates of the MWF and T2 values. The choice of integration range for the short-T2 component had a significant effect on MWF estimates, but not on reproducibility.



Conclusion:

The reproducibility of QT2 measurements using existing methods is moderate and the method can be used in longitudinal studies, with careful consideration of the methodologic variability and an appropriate group size.

In this paper we analyze the rise of DIYbio, its community, its material resources and its applications. We look at the current projects developed for the international genetically engineered machine competition in order to get a sense of what amateur biologists can potentially create in their community laboratories over the coming years. We also show why and how the DIYbio community, in the context of a global governance development, is putting in place a safety/ethical framework for guarantying the pursuit of its activity. And finally we argue that the global spread of DIY biology potentially reconfigures and opens up access to biological information and laboratory equipment and that, therefore, it can foster new practices and transversal collaborations between professional scientists and amateurs.","",""

From computational models of organelles, cells, and simple organisms, to physiological models of tissues, organ systems, and ecosystems, a diverse array of biological systems have been the target of large-scale computational modeling efforts. Nonetheless, these research agendas have yet to prove decisively their value among the broader community of theoretical and experimental biologists. In this commentary, we examine a range of philosophical and practical issues relevant to understanding the potential of integrative simulations. We discuss the role of theory and modeling in different areas of physics and suggest that certain sub-disciplines of physics provide useful cultural analogies for imagining the future role of simulations in biological research. We examine philosophical issues related to modeling which consistently arise in discussions about integrative simulations and suggest a pragmatic viewpoint that balances a belief in philosophy with the recognition of the relative infancy of our state of philosophical understanding. Finally, we discuss community workflow and publication practices to allow research to be readily discoverable and amenable to incorporation into simulations. We argue that there are aligned incentives in widespread adoption of practices which will both advance the needs of integrative simulation efforts as well as other contemporary trends in the biological sciences, ranging from open science and data sharing to improving reproducibility.","",""

The rationale for preprint servers is fundamentally simple: to make the results of research available to the scientific community as soon as possible, instead of waiting until the peer-review process is fully completed. Sharing manuscripts using preprint servers has numerous advantages, including: 1) rapid dissemination of work-in-progress to a wider audience; 2) immediate visibility of the research output for early-career scientists; 3) improved peer review by encouraging feedback from the entire research community; and 4) a fair and straightforward way to establish precedence.

Open preprint servers offer a great opportunity for open science, especially if the community embraces the idea of discussing preprints. Initiatives like Haldane's Sieve (http://haldanessieve.org/), a new blog discussing arXiv papers in population genetics, can help make arXiv attractive for scientists looking to promote their work [1]. These initiatives are important to fully exploit the potential of open preprint servers. Posting preprints online increases the community of available informal peer reviewers, and uses the internet for its original community-building purposes.

Preprints began to gain popularity 20 years ago with the advent of arXiv, an open preprint server widely used in physics and mathematics [2]. Preprints are also integral to the culture of other scientific fields. Paul Krugman noted that, in economics, the “traditional model of submit, get refereed, publish, and then people will read your work broke down a long time ago. In fact, it had more or less fallen apart by the early 80 s” [3]. In addition to a section on arXiv, economists have the RePEc (Research Papers in Economics) initiative, which aims to create an archive of working papers, manuscripts, and book chapters.

Despite the success of this approach in other fields, most manuscripts in biology are not posted to preprint servers and are therefore not seen by more than a handful of other scientists prior to publication. In this article, we highlight the advantages of open preprint servers for both scientists and publishers, discuss the preprint policies of major publishers in biology, and describe the main options to publish preprints (Box 1, Table 1).

Changes in ventricular rotation measured by two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography (2DSTE) are early indicators of cardiac disease. Data on the clinical feasibility of this important measure are scarce and there is no information on the comparability of different software versions. We assessed the feasibility, reproducibility and within patient temporal variability of 2DSTE in a large community based sample of older adults. We additionally compared 2DSTE results to those generated by 3DSTE.
Methods and results

1408 participants underwent transthoracic echocardiography. Using Philips Qlab 8.1 peak LV rotation at either the base or the apex was analysable in 432 (31%) participants. Peak twist measurements were achieved in 274 (20%) participants. 66 participants were randomly selected for the reproducibility study. 20 additional participants had scans 4–6 weeks apart for temporal variability and 3D echocardiography to assess the agreement between 2DSTE and 3DSTE. Reproducibility was evaluated using the intraclass coefficient of correlation (ICC). Better reproducibility for rotation and twist were obtained when measured at the endocardium, and when using more recent software versions, Peak twist and rotation were significantly different using two versions of the same software. Agreement with 3DSTE was better using newer software.
Conclusion

Feasibility of 2DSTE is low in this cohort of elderly individuals severely limiting its utility in clinical settings. However if high quality images can be acquired assessment of ventricular rotation by 2DSTE is reproducible. Caution should be taken when comparing measurements of ventricular rotation by software from different vendors or different versions of software from the same vendor.",WOS:000324408400108,PLOS ONE

Methods: Fifty-two girls and 45 boys, ages 7–17.8 participated in the study. Three walk tests were administered 1 week apart. Each visit corresponded to a specific test, either an incremental treadmill test, or the 6MWT. The 6MWT was performed on two occasions 1 week apart to assess reproducibility. Treadmill and walk tests were randomly assigned to avoid order effect. Results: Subjects walked 689.4 ± 98.6 m on the initial 6MWT and 690.4 ± 98.2 m on the second test. Intraclass correlation coefficient was r = 0.99. The Bland and Altman method also showed good agreement between the two 6MWTs.

In recent years, several extensions to STROBE have been created to provide more nuanced field-specific guidance for authors. The content and the prevalence of extension endorsement have not yet been assessed. Accordingly, there are two aims: (1) to classify changes made in the extensions to identify strengths and weaknesses of the original STROBE checklist and (2) to determine the prevalence and typology of endorsement by journals in fields related to extensions. Methods and analysis Two independent researchers will assess additions in each extension. Additions will be coded as ‘field specific’ (FS) or ‘not field specific’ (NFS). FS is defined as particularly relevant information for a single field and guidance provided generally cannot be extrapolated beyond that field. NFS is defined as information that reflects epidemiological or methodological tenets and can be generalised to most, if not all, types of observational research studies. Intraclass correlation will be calculated to measure reviewers’ concordance. On disagreement, consensus will be sought. Individual additions will be grouped by STROBE checklist items to identify the frequency and distribution of changes. Journals in fields related to extensions will be identified through National Library of Medicine PubMed Broad Subject Terms, screened for eligibility and further distilled via Ovid MEDLINE® search strategies for observational studies. Text describing endorsement will be extracted from each journal’s website. A classification scheme will be created for endorsement types and the prevalence of endorsement will be estimated. Analyses will use NVivo V.11 and SAS University Edition. Ethics and dissemination This study does not require ethical approval as it does not involve human participants. This study has been preregistered on Open Science Framework.","",""

Therein lies its strength. Both Science (with a capital S), “a reliable body of knowledge about how the world works” (2), and science (with a lower case s) the process of accumulating knowledge carried out by individual scientists (2), are built upon a foundation of trust and verification—trust among scientists, who rely on each others' data and conclusions, and trust between scientists and the public, which funds much of the science and relies on Science to improve the quality of our lives.",WOS:000332384500001,MOLECULAR ENDOCRINOLOGY

Due to its intensive resource requirements, the scientific workflows are often executed on distributed platforms, including campus clusters, grids and clouds. In this paper we build a scientific workflow for blast2cap3, the protein-guided assembly, using the Pegasus Workflow Management System (Pegasus WMS). The modularity of blast2cap3 allows us to decompose the existing serial approach on multiple tasks, some of which can be run in parallel. Afterwards, this workflow is deployed on two distributed execution platforms: Sandhills, the University of Nebraska Campus Cluster, and the Open Science Grid (OSG). We compare and evaluate the performance of the built workflow for the both platforms. Furthermore, we also investigate the influence of the number of clusters of transcripts in the blast2cap3 workflow over the total running time. The performed experiments show that the Pegasus WMS implementation of blast2cap3 significantly reduces the running time compared to the current serial implementation of blast2cap3 for more than 95 %. Although OSG provides more computational resources than Sandhills, our workflow experimental runs have better running time on Sandhills. Moreover, the selection of 300 clusters of transcripts gives the optimum performance with the resources allocated from Sandhills.",WOS:000399141700063,PROCEEDINGS OF 2014 IEEE INTERNATIONAL PARALLEL & DISTRIBUTED PROCESSING SYMPOSIUM WORKSHOPS (IPDPSW)

Design: A MEDLINE, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Cochrane and related references literature review was conducted on dietary assessment methods for adolescents reporting the validity and/or reproducibility values. A study quality assessment on the retrieved FFQ was carried out according to two different scoring systems, judging respectively the quality of FFQ nutrition information and of FFQ validation and calibration. Setting: The present review considered adolescents attending high schools and recruited in hospitals or at home. Subjects: The target of the review was the healthy adolescent population in the age range 13–17 years. Results: Thirty-two eligible papers were included and analysed separately as ‘original articles’ (n 20) and ‘reviews’ (n 12). The majority (n 17) assessed the validation and reproducibility of FFQ. Almost all studies found the questionnaires to be valid and reproducible (r . 0?4), except for some food groups and nutrients. Different design and validation issues were highlighted, such as portion-size estimation, number of food items and statistics used. Conclusions: The present review offers new insights in relation to the characteristics of assessment methods for dietary intake in adolescents. Further meta-analysis is required although the current review provides important indications on the development of a new FFQ, addressing the need for a valid, reproducible, userfriendly, cost-effective method of accurately assessing nutrient intakes in adolescents.",WOS:000344545400011,PUBLIC HEALTH NUTRITION

Five examiners independently identified the three landmarks that form FH plane. Intra-examiner reproducibility and inter-examiner reliability, correlation coefficients (ICC), coefficient of variability and BlandAltman plots were obtained for all landmarks coordinates to assess reproducibility. Intra-examiner reproducibility and interexaminer reliability in terms of location and plane angulation were also assessed. Results: Intra- and inter-examiner reliabilities for X, Y and Z coordinates of all three landmarks were excellent with ICC values ranging from 0.914 to 0.998. Differences among examiners were more in X and Z than in Y dimensions. The Bland–Altman analysis demonstrated excellent intra- as well as inter-examiner agreement between examiners in all coordinates for all landmarks. Intra-examiner reproducibility and inter-examiner reliability of the three landmarks in terms of distance showed mean differences between 1.3 to 2.9 mm, Mean differences in plane angulation were between 1.0u to 1.5u among examiners.

Whether this may be accomplished in centers with less CTA experience remains unknown. Objectives We determined the diagnostic performance and interobserver reproducibility of CTA in detecting significant CAD in a center with limited experience. Methods In 209 patients, CTA was performed with 64-slice or dual-source CT technology, and analyses were performed independently by 2 inexperienced observers. Significant CAD by CTA was defined as ≥1 stenoses ≥50% or ≥1 nonevaluable segment, whereas significant CAD by invasive quantitative coronary angiography was defined as ≥1 stenoses ≥50%. We evaluated the influence of CAD pretest probability, Agatston score (AS), heart rate (HR), and observer experience on the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV), interobserver reproducibility, and duration of CTA analysis. Results Per-patient (CAD prevalence, 35%) sensitivity was 88%–99%, specificity was 78%–82%, PPV was 68%–74%, and NPV was 92%–99%. Overall interobserver reproducibility was good (κ = 0.65). A significant temporal improvement was observed in diagnostic specificity (observer A: 68%–89%, P = 0.007; observer B: 71%–89%, P = 0.02), and interobserver reproducibility (κ = 0.35–0.89, P = 0.01) during the study period. Duration of analysis decreased during the study period and was positively associated with CAD pretest probability and AS. Conclusions Suboptimal diagnostic performance and interobserver reproducibility must be anticipated during CTA implementation.

Lower costs are attracting new users to medical ultrasound. Anticipating an increase in this trend, we conducted a study to quantify the variability in ultrasonic measurements made by novice users and identify methods to reduce it. We designed a protocol with four presets and trained four new users to scan and manually measure the head circumference of a fetal phantom with an ultrasound scanner. In the first phase, the users followed this protocol in seven distinct sessions. They then received feedback on the quality of the scans from an expert. In the second phase, two of the users repeated the entire protocol aided by visual cues provided to them during scanning. We performed off-line measurements on all the images using a fully automated algorithm capable of measuring the head circumference from fetal phantom images. The ground truth (198.1±1.6 mm) was based on sixteen scans and measurements made by an expert. Our analysis shows that: (1) the inter-observer variability of manual measurements was 5.5 mm, whereas the inter-observer variability of automated measurements was only 0.6 mm in the first phase (2) consistency of image appearance improved and mean manual measurements was 4-5 mm closer to the ground truth in the second phase (3) automated measurements were more precise, accurate and less sensitive to different presets compared to manual measurements in both phases.

Food frequency questionnaires are used to assess dietary intake in epidemiological studies. Objective. The aim of the study was to assess the relative validity and reproducibility of a quantitative food frequency questionnaire (QFFQ) for adolescents with type 1 diabetes. Methods: Validity was evaluated by comparing the data generated by QFFQs to those of 24-hour recalls (24 hrs). QFFQs were applied twice per patient to assess reproducibility. Statistical analysis included performing t-tests, obtaining Pearson correlation coefficients when necessary, correcting measurements for randomness by the weighted kappa method, calculating intraclass correlation coefficients, and generating Bland-Altman plots (). Results. The total energy and nutrient intake as estimated by the QFFQs were significantly higher than those from 24 hrs. Pearson correlation coefficients for energy-adjusted, deattenuated data ranged from 0.32 (protein) to 0.75 (lipid, unsaturated fat and calcium). Weighted kappa values ranged from 0.15 (vitamin C) to 0.45 (calcium). Bland-Altman plots indicated acceptable validity. As for reproducibility, intraclass correlation coefficients ranged from 0.24 (calcium) to 0.65 (lipid), and the Bland-Altman plots showed good agreement between the two questionnaires.

During the last decade, the single transpulmonary thermodilution (TPTD) technique was implemented in clinical practice. The purpose of this paper was to systematically review and critically assess the existing data concerning the reproducibility of CO measured using TPTD (COTPTD). A total of 16 studies were identified to potentially be included in our study because these studies had the required information that allowed for calculating the reproducibility of COTPTD measurements. 14 adult studies and 2 pediatric studies were analyzed. In total, 3432 averaged CO values in the adult population and 78 averaged CO values in the pediatric population were analyzed. The overall reproducibility of COTPTD measurements was 6.1 ± 2.0 % in the adult studies and 3.9 ± 2.9 % in the pediatric studies. An average of 3 boluses was necessary for obtaining a mean CO value. Achieving more than 3 boluses did not improve reproducibility; however, achieving less than 3 boluses significantly affects the reproducibility of this technique.

Quality control is a mainstay to reduce variability among institutions and operators and must be obtained by using appropriate procedures for data acquisition, storage and interpretation of echo-Doppler data. This goal can be achieved by employing an echo core laboratory (ECL), with the responsibility for standardizing image acquisition processes (performed at the peripheral echo-labs) and analysis (by monitoring and optimizing the internal intra- and inter-reader variability of measurements). Accordingly, the Working Group of Echocardiography of the Italian Society of Cardiology decided to design standardized procedures for imaging acquisition in peripheral laboratories and reading procedures and to propose a methodological approach to assess the reproducibility of echo-Doppler parameters of cardiac structure and function by using both standard and advanced technologies. A number of cardiologists experienced in cardiac ultrasound was involved to set up an ECL available for future studies involving complex imaging or including echo-Doppler measures as primary or secondary efficacy or safety end-points. The present manuscript describes the methodology of the procedures (imaging acquisition and measurement reading) and provides the documentation of the work done so far to test the reproducibility of the different echo-Doppler modalities (standard and advanced). These procedures can be suggested for utilization also in non referall echocardiographic laboratories as an \"inside\" quality check, with the aim at optimizing clinical consistency of echo-Doppler data.",WOS:000296456200001,CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND

VEPs of Sprague–Dawley rats were recorded on one randomly selected eye on three separate days within a week, and the recordings were repeated three times on the first day to evaluate the intrasession repeatability and intersession reproducibility. The VEPs were recorded with subdermal needle and implanted skull screw electrodes, respectively, to evaluate the effect of electrode configuration on VEP reproducibility. We also designed a mini-Ganzfeld stimulator for rats, which provided better eye isolation than the conventional visual stimuli such as flash strobes and large Ganzfeld systems. The VEP responses from mini-Ganzfeld were compared with PS33-PLUS photic strobe and single light-emitting diode (LED). The latencies of P1, N1, P2, N2, and P3 and the amplitude of each component were measured and analysed. Intrasession and intersession within-subject standard deviations (Sw), coefficient of variation, repeatability (R95) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were calculated. The VEPs recorded using the implanted skull electrodes showed significantly larger amplitude and higher reproducibility compared to the needle electrodes (P < 0.05). The mini-Ganzfeld stimulator showed superior repeatability and reproducibility in VEP recording. The intra/intersession ICCs of latency were 0.85/0.70 for mini-Ganzfeld, 0.72/0.62 for PS33-PLUS and only 0.59/0.42 for single LED. The latencies of the early peaks (N1 and P2) demonstrated better reproducibility than the later waves. The mean intrasession and intersession ICCs were 0.96 and 0.86 for the early peaks. Using a combination of skull screw electrodes, mini-Ganzfeld stimulator and early peak analysis, we achieved a high reproducibility in the rat VEP measurement. The latencies of the early peaks of rat VEPs were more consistent, which may be due to their generation in the primary visual cortex via the retino-geniculate fibres.",WOS:000297850200005,DOCUMENTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA

The non-invasive equipment Diers 4-D formetric ® , using the Moire principle to estimate spine and pelvis configuration from the external aspect of the back, allows for the quantification of angles, surfaces, torsion and balance. Objective To assess the reproducibility and coefficient of variation of formetric 4D measurements in repeat assessments of healthy, asymptomatic persons. Materials and methods Repeat measurements were performed in an initial group of 38 volunteers by assessors with basic training, and in an advanced group of 113 persons by fully trained assessors, who have gone through a learning curve. Variables related to kyphosis, lordosis and trunk as well as pelvis torsion were measured, and results of the repeat measurements were analysed using appropriate statistics. Aside from estimating correlations between repeat measurements, Bland and Altman plots and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis were applied in order to quantify the inter-assay variability and the coefficient of variation. Results The kyphotic and lordotic angulations were higher in women than in men. In the initial group the correlation between the repeat measurements was satisfactory ( r  = 0.49–0.55), and there was no trend towards over- or underestimation between repeat measurements. However, the dispersion of the difference between the repeat measurements was relatively broad, resulting in a coefficient of variation of approximately 13–14% for the kyphotic and lordotic angulations. The reproducibility in the advanced group was clearly better with coefficients of variation of approximately 7% for angulations of kyphosis and lordosis, as well as for pelvic inclination. In contrast, the reproducibility of estimates of torsion was poor. Conclusion The examinations using the Diers 4-D formetric system must be performed with great care for exact positioning of the person, and require adequate training. The interpretation of the effect of treatment should take into account the variability between repeat measurements. Provided the technique is applied correctly, the reproducibility of results is excellent, making this non-invasive system appropriate for clinical trials.",WOS:000367115800001,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OSTEOPATHIC MEDICINE

For QA, an ideal dose verification system should be independent of the treatment-planning system (TPS). This paper describes the development and reproducibility evaluation of a Monte Carlo (MC)-based standard LINAC model as a preliminary requirement for independent verification of dose distributions. The BEAMnrc MC code is used for characterization of the 6-, 10- and 15-MV photon beams for a wide range of field sizes. The modeling of the LINAC head components is based on the specifications provided by the manufacturer. MC dose distributions are tuned to match Varian Golden Beam Data (GBD). For reproducibility evaluation, calculated beam data is compared with beam data measured at individual institutions. For all energies and field sizes, the MC and GBD agreed to within 1.0% for percentage depth doses (PDDs), 1.5% for beam profiles and 1.2% for total scatter factors (Scps.). Reproducibility evaluation showed that the maximum average local differences were 1.3% and 2.5% for PDDs and beam profiles, respectively. MC and institutions' mean Scps agreed to within 2.0%. An MC-based standard LINAC model developed to independently verify dose distributions for QA of multi-institutional clinical trials and routine clinical practice has proven to be highly accurate and reproducible and can thus help ensure that prescribed doses delivered are consistent with the requirements of clinical protocols.",WOS:000345825700012,JOURNAL OF RADIATION RESEARCH

However, with the increasing complexities of new technologies and techniques, coupled with the specialisation of experiments, reproducing research findings has become a growing challenge. Clearly, scientific methods must be conveyed succinctly, and with clarity and rigour, in order for research to be reproducible. Here, we propose steps to help increase the transparency of the scientific method and the reproducibility of research results: specifically, we introduce a peer-review oath and accompanying manifesto. These have been designed to offer guidelines to enable reviewers (with the minimum friction or bias) to follow and apply open science principles, and support the ideas of transparency, reproducibility and ultimately greater societal impact. Introducing the oath and manifesto at the stage of peer review will help to check that the research being published includes everything that other researchers would need to successfully repeat the work. Peer review is the lynchpin of the publishing system: encouraging the community to consciously (and conscientiously) uphold these principles should help to improve published papers, increase confidence in the reproducibility of the work and, ultimately, provide strategic benefits to authors and their institutions.","",""

However, who is that explanation for, and how is this explanation communicated once it has been deduced?
Scientific research is typically communicated via papers in journals, with an abstract presented as a summary of that explanation. However, in many instances they may be written in a manner which is non-communicatory to a lay reader. This study begins to investigate if poetry could be used as an alternative form of communication, by first assessing if poetic verse is an effective form of communication to other scientists. In order to assess this suitability, a survey was conducted in which two different groups of participants were asked questions based on a scientific abstract. One group of participants was given the original scientific abstract, whilst the second group was instead given a poem written about the scientific study. Quantitative analysis found that whilst a scientific audience found a poetic interpretation of a scientific abstract to be no less interesting or inspiring than the original prose, they did find it to be less accessible. However, further qualitative analysis suggested that the poem did a good job in conveying a similar meaning to that presented in the original abstract. The results of this study indicate that whilst for a scientific audience poetry should not replace the prose abstract, it could be used alongside the original format to inspire the reader to find out more about the topic. Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of this approach for a general audience.","",""

In particular, we analyse the micro-level interactions to point out the different network structures shaped by university-owned and university-invented patents. We detected three subnetwork typologies (labelled type A, B, and C) that exemplify different qualitative relational structures as well as different attributions to propriety rights. Type A (open science) exemplifies the typical owned patent; type B (multiple ties) represents the hybrid structure with multiple ties and involvement of academics as individuals and of universities as organisation; type C (disconnected subnetworks) represents the typical invented patent with no role of universities as organisation. The whole network seems to show a breaking point in terms of connectivity around 2005, a year that marks a change in policy rule and strategic orientation of Italian universities towards patenting. After 2005, the number of actors grew disproportionally and the network appears disconnected in several comparable components. Also, the composition in terms of subnetwork types changed. The overall picture seems to underline a big structural change dominated by the important increase of academic patenting both direct (university ownership) and indirect (increasing academic patenting).","",""

In the automatic correlation process, the first cartridge of each firearm is separately performed correlation against the database. It is found that the similarity score for match objects changes slightly as the shot number increases, indicating slight variations of marks. However, these variations have not prohibited the Evofinder ® system to make correct correlation and rank 100% of the known match objects on the top of the correlation list by either firing pin impression or breech face mark.

To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of a double-pass instrument (OQASII, Visiomereics SL, Spain), which objectively measures overall optical quality of the human eyes.


Methods 
The right eye of 119 healthy subjects with best corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better was included in this prospective, comparative, observational study. Two separate tests with OQASII were conducted sequentially on the same day by two different examiners. A week later, the first examiner conducted the third measurement. All subjects underwent three consecutive tests during each session. The repeatability and reproducibility of the modulation transfer function cut off frequency (MTF cutoff), the Strehl ratio, the OQAS values (OVs) at contrasts of 100%, 20% and 9%, and the objective scatter index (OSI) were analyzed.


Results 
For MTF cutoff, Strehl ratio, OV100%, OV20%, OV9%, and OSI, the mean values were 39.32±9.75cpd, 0.22±0.06, 1.31±0.33, 1.33±0.39, 1.33±0.41, 0.60±0.42, respectively. Repeatability and reproducibility were good with a very low coefficient of variation and high interclass correlation coefficients (>0.88) for all parameters. Bland-Altman plots showed good correlation with 95% limits of agreement ranged from -6.04 to 6.78cpd, -0.05 to 0.05, -0.20 to 0.23, -0.29 to 0.32, -0.40 to 0.42, -0.23 to 0.21 in inter-observer, and -6.56 to 7.42cpd, -0.06 to 0.06, -0.22 to 0.24, -0.30 to 0.32, -0.35 to 0.34, -0.24 to 0.23 in inter-visit, respectively.

Methods: Six patient plans were selected from among four treatment sites. Six methods of IMRT QA were chosen: film and cc04 ion chamber in a body phantom, diode array with all fields AP, as well as with fields delivered rotationally (in a MapPhan phantom), and an in‐house designed solid water phantom with an insert containing 5 ion chambers that can rotate to eight positions. Each of the six plans was delivered three times. The system was then re‐setup and redelivered. This last step was repeated, giving three redelivered plans, and three plans that were delivered under independent set ups. Reproducibility was quantified by the coefficients of variation (CV) of the re‐deliveries and the re‐setup deliveries. Results: Of all detectors investigated, film has the highest CV, with an average CV of 1.56% for re‐deliveries, and 2.46% for re‐setup. For the re‐setup and re‐delivery, the lowest average CV's are the AP diode array with 0.25%, and the ion chamber with 0.13%, respectively. Additionally the standard deviation in dose across the ion chambers calculated by the TPS was compared to the standard deviation of the re‐setup measurements for the in‐house phantom, giving a weak correlation. Conclusion: Different IMRT QA devices exhibit different reproducibility; however all CV's were lower than 5%, indicating good consistency in measurement. Film's dependence on the processor and choice of normalization point are possible reasons why this dosimetry system had a higher CV. This information will help quantify the confidence of IMRT QA performed in the clinic and provide valuable information on the reproducibility of various IMRT QA devices.

To determine the reproducibility of MR elastography (MRE) and the reproducibility and repeatability of the stiffness measurement of MRE in the staging of liver fibrosis.



Materials and Methods

Ninety-four patients, who underwent liver MRE, were included in this study. The patients were classified into group 1 (n = 47) and group 2 (n = 47) according to our knowledge of their histologic hepatic fibrosis (HF) stage. To analyze the reproducibility of MRE, the group 1 patients underwent MRE twice. In addition, to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the stiffness measurement of MRE, a single observer measured the stiffness values of the second MREs in group 1 twice, and two observers independently measured the stiffness values of MRE in group 2. A 95% Bland-Altman limits of agreement and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were used to evaluate the reproducibility and repeatability of MRE.



Results

In group I, there was no significant difference in the mean liver stiffness values of the first and second MRE examinations, i.e., 3.45 ± 0.25 kPa vs. 3.35 ± 0.23 kPa (p = 0.22). The reproducibility of the MRE examination and the reproducibility and repeatability of the stiffness measurement were high, i.e., the ICCs of each parameter were 0.945, 0.827, and 0.963, respectively, and the 95% limits of agreement were 25.3%, 35.35%, and 18.0%, respectively.



Conclusion

MRE is a promising tool for evaluating HF and has high reproducibility of the examination as well as reproducibility and repeatability of the stiffness measurements. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2014;39:326–331. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",WOS:000329753400010,JOURNAL OF MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING

Examples of mechanistic explanations from the sciences involve mechanisms that have been shown to produce phenomena with a reproducible rate of success. By contrast, if phenomena are infrequent to the point that they amount to irreproducible observations and experimental results, they are indistinguishable from the background noise of accidental happenings.

Yet for a variety of reasons, irreproducibility appears to be a growing problem in experimental research. Now funding agencies and research journals are crafting guidelines to ensure that published studies are well designed, well reported, and better able to generate reproducible results.

Media reports have singled out a number of egregious cases of irreproducibility, including reports published in Nature earlier this year indicating that adult stem cells would become pluripotent if submerged in a mild acid bath.1,2 The findings were widely criticized after scientists were unable to reproduce the results in their own laboratories.3 Subsequently, the first author agreed to retract the reports.4 In another widely publicized example, the biopharmaceutical company Amgen claimed it could reproduce just 6 of 53 studies that were considered landmarks in basic cancer research, despite close cooperation with the original scientists to make sure the same experimental protocols were used.5

Experts blame the irreproducibility problem on a number of factors, including inadequate reporting of the methods used in published research studies. Mounting evidence links poor methods descriptions with overstated findings,6,7,8,9,10 but in other cases faulty conclusions can be attributed to poor study design. In particular, inadequate randomization and blinding can introduce biases that render a study incapable of accurately testing its thesis.11

Irreproducibility is especially problematic if it plagues findings that lead to human clinical trials or to regulations and policies that could affect public health. One such instance was documented by researchers at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS), who discovered that patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis had been enrolled in a clinical trial founded on inadequate preclinical data.

According to NINDS director Story Landis, the patients weren’t doing nearly as well as hoped on the test treatment, a broad-spectrum antibiotic called minocycline. When NINDS researchers took a closer look at the preclinical studies upon which the trial was predicated, they found the authors had not reported whether the studies were randomized or blinded. Furthermore, the work was done using small numbers of animals. “That was a wake-up call,” Landis says. “Human clinical trials need to be based on solid preclinical findings.”",WOS:000338928000007,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES

It has been claimed by many critics, however, that this ‘entrepreneurial turn’ presents conflicts with long established academic norms, procedures, and reward systems. This paper utilizes a national survey of faculty attitudes towards academic entrepreneurship to investigate the extent to which the ‘entrepreneurial turn’ has become accepted and taken-for-granted, to identify which academic entrepreneurial activities are deemed appropriate, or legitimate, and those that are widely regarded as inappropriate, and to identify the most salient dimensions by which faculty attitudes vary. The results provide evidence that the entrepreneurial turn within research universities in the US has not yet become ‘taken-for-granted’, that the norm of open science is still widely accepted and conflicts with some academic entrepreneurship activities. There seems to be a broad—though not consensual—agreement on the boundaries of what are deemed appropriate and legitimate entrepreneurial activities that spans disciplines and across prior levels of faculty experience in academic entrepreneurship.",WOS:000273086800005,ANNALS OF REGIONAL SCIENCE

Previous work has suggested that the intensity and the duration of activation in brain areas that encode the contents of perception determine whether or not the information contributes directly to subjective experience. Now Schurger et al. (p. [97][1], published online 12 November; see the Perspective by [Schwarzkopf and Rees][2] ) describe a third property that distinguishes conscious from nonconscious neural encoding reproducibility. Spatiotemporal patterns of brain activity were recorded while subjects performed a simple visual category-discrimination task. Activation patterns corresponding to conscious information were more reproducible—i.e., more reliable, across different presentations of the same stimulus category, compared to nonconscious activation patterns coding for the same perception.

We assessed the reproducibility of PWV values using the carotid-radial PWV measurement. We have measured the carotid-femoral PWV and carotid-radial PWV with an automated system (Pulse Pen, DiaTecne) using 2 different blind operators in 105 hemodialysis (HD) patients. The carotid-femoral waveforms were acquired by the first blind operator simultaneously with 2 pressure-sensitive transducers and the transit time of the pulse was calculated using the system software. Similarly, the second blind operator acquired the carotid-radial waveforms. The two operators performed 2 consecutive measurements from the same subject, in a random order. In fact, after the first operator had completed 2 consecutive measurements from 1 subject, all of the sensors were detached, and the second operator attached sensors again to the same subject. The measurements were performed during interval of a midweek dialysis-free day. To evaluate the reproducibility of the system, both within-observer and between-observer analyses were performed. We studied 105 dialysis patients (HD) and 20 controls. All HD patients had three dialysis sessions lasting at least 4 h/wk. A total of 28 patients (26.7%) had diabetic nephropathy. The mean age of HD was 64.6 16.1 years, the body weight was 71.1 15.1 kg, and the height was 164.6 6.1 cm. All population studied is referral at a tertiary care from at least 6 months (mean 11.1 2.1 months). A total of 45% of patients are smokers or ex-smokers. The PWV of carotid-femoral is 8.58 3.99 and the PWV of carotid-radial is 8.70 4.01 m/sec, respectively, by the first and the second operator; the difference of PWV (femoral-radial measure) is 0.037 0.99 m/sec. The linear correlation of carotid-femoral vs. carotid-radial PWV measurements is the highest (R 2 = 0.90). The results regarding reproducibility, including mean differences and standard deviations, standard errors, and correlation coefficients were analyzed for each regional PWV value for the between-observer and within-observer studies. All of the measurements showed significant correlation coefficients, ranging from 0.94 to 0.98. The reproducibility of regional PWV values for 2 consecutive measurements from the same subject was also analyzed using Bland-Altman plots, with the reproducibility expressed as the mean difference and 2 standard deviations between the measurements obtained by the 2 operators during carotid-femoral and carotid-radial measurements. Carotid-radial PWV measurement provides an accurate analysis with a high reproducibility with respect to carotidfemoral PWV measurement, and it can be used for arterial stiffness analysis in hemodialysis patients.",WOS:000283174100016,HEMODIALYSIS INTERNATIONAL

We conclude by identifying some future research directions in better connecting researchers and communicating scientific outcomes in the context of climate change impact and adaptation. Highlights? VREs are useful to support climate change adaptation research. ? Visualisation is a powerful front-end to climate and biophysical models. ? Challenges remain in e-Science in supporting (near) real-time decision making. ?

A key step toward reproducibility of biomolecular NMR studies was the establishment of public data repositories (PDB and BMRB). Nevertheless, bio-NMR studies routinely fall short of the requirement for reproducibility that all the data needed to reproduce the results are published. A key limitation is that considerable metadata goes unpublished, notably manual interventions that are typically applied during the assignment of multidimensional NMR spectra. A general solution to this problem has been elusive, in part because of the wide range of approaches and software packages employed in the analysis of protein NMR spectra. Here we describe an approach for capturing missing metadata during the assignment of protein NMR spectra that can be generalized to arbitrary workflows, different software packages, other biomolecules, or other stages of data analysis in bio-NMR. We also present extensions to the NMR-STAR data dictionary that enable machine archival and retrieval of the “missing” metadata.",WOS:000361980400003,JOURNAL OF BIOMOLECULAR NMR

Whether scientists can accurately assess which experiments will reproduce original findings is important to determining the pace at which science self-corrects. We collected forecasts from basic and preclinical cancer researchers on the first 6 replication studies conducted by the Reproducibility Project: Cancer Biology (RP:CB) to assess the accuracy of expert judgments on specific replication outcomes. On average, researchers forecasted a 75% probability of replicating the statistical significance and a 50% probability of replicating the effect size, yet none of these studies successfully replicated on either criterion (for the 5 studies with results reported). Accuracy was related to expertise: experts with higher h-indices were more accurate, whereas experts with more topic-specific expertise were less accurate. Our findings suggest that experts, especially those with specialized knowledge, were overconfident about the RP:CB replicating individual experiments within published reports; researcher optimism likely reflects a combination of overestimating the validity of original studies and underestimating the difficulties of repeating their methodologies.",WOS:000404510400020,PLOS BIOLOGY

Methods Fast macular thickness scans and 6 mm cross hair scans were obtained from 100 eyes with all subtypes of AMD using Stratus OCT. Consensus readings were performed by two certified OCT readers of each reading center using their grading protocol. Common variables of both grading protocols, such as presence of cystoid spaces, subretinal fluid, vitreomacular traction and retinal pigment epithelial detachment, were compared using k statistics. In addition, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for centre point thickness (CPT) of values re-measured manually in the presence of alignment errors. Results The reproducibility was dependent on the variable measured with a k value of 0.81 for the presence of cystoid spaces, 0.78 for the presence of subretinal fluid and 0.795 for the presence of vitreomacular traction. The lowest reproducibility was found for the presence of retinal pigment epithelial detachment with a k value of 0.51. The CPT was remeasured in 29 out of 100 scans at both sites with an ICC of the re-measured thicknesses of 0.92.

Reproducibility is receiving increased attention across many domains of science and genomics is no exception. Efforts to identify copy number variations (CNVs) from exome sequence (ES) data have been increasing. Many algorithms have been published to discover CNVs from exomes and a major challenge is the reproducibility in other datasets. Here we test exome CNV calling reproducibility under three conditions: data generated by different sequencing centers; varying sample sizes; and varying capture methodology.",WOS:000381345000001,GENOME MEDICINE

A description of the RDM context in Canada is provided. This environment has heightened expectations around the Government of Canada’s Open Science plans and includes deliverables aimed at improving access to publications and data resulting from federally funded scientific activities. At the same time, a recent environmental scan published by Canada’s three federal research granting councils reveals significant gaps in services, infrastructure, and funding mechanisms to support RDM. In addition, Canada’s RDM environment consists of stakeholders from a variety of communities with minimal ongoing coordination or cooperation. The Portage network was conceived as a collaborative network model based on libraries’ strong connections with researchers across the disciplines, an ethos of curation and preservation, and experience with systems for managing data in all its forms. A pilot project provided Portage with a vision and set of principles, and identified several objectives as the small wins that would build the trust and shared understanding required for a successful network. Current services and activities of Portage, including a data management planning tool and an infrastructure project, are described in this paper. Portage now faces the challenge of moving from project to operational network, and the challenge of establishing a sustainable governance model. CARL appointed a Steering Committee that will be proposing a full governance model at the conclusion of this transition period. Using a framework of factors identified in the literature, several relevant collaborative and network governance models are being explored. This paper outlines experience to date with Portage and matters under consideration for long-term sustainability, with a goal of engaging international colleagues in discussion and furthering the concepts for the benefit of RDM networks everywhere.","",""

However, junior faculty, fellows, and residents have little or no training in statistics and are forced to rely on the interpretation of results based solely on the authors or secondary sources. This education gap applies to an even larger audience including many physicians, researchers, journalists, and policy makers. That is a dangerous approach. Statistical analysis of data often involves the calculation and reporting of the p-value as statistically significant or not, without much further thought. But p-values are highly un-replicable and their definition is not directly associated with reproducibility. Findings from clinical studies are not valid if they cannot be reproduced. Although other methodological issues relate to reproducibility, such as statistical power to reproduce an effect, the p-value is arguably at the root of the problem given its wide variability from study to study. Many common misinterpretations and misuses of the p-value are practiced. It is essential to bring more awareness to this critical issue by providing a deeper educational understanding of the p-value to the proper interpretation of study results. Recognizing this need the American Statistical Association (ASA) recently published its first ever policy statement concerning their proper use and interpretation of p-values for scientists and researchers. This policy statement addresses the misguided practice of interpreting study results based solely on the p-value, given that it is often irreproducible in subsequent, similar studies. To further educate and illustrate this issue we investigated the irreproducibility of the p-value by using simulation software and results reported from a published randomized control trial. We show that the probability of attaining another statistically significant p-value varied quite widely on replication. We also show that power alone determines the distribution of p, and will vary with sample size and effect size. The percentage of replication means which fell within the original confidence interval (CI) from each replicated experiment revealed that the 95% CI included only 85.4% of future replication means. In conclusion, p-values interpreted solely by themselves, can be misleading if interpreted devoid of context potentially leading to biased inferences from clinical studies.",WOS:000413850600009,PROGRESS IN PEDIATRIC CARDIOLOGY

Optimizing experimental protocols to ensure reproducibility is an important aspect of scientific work. Genetic or pharmacological lifespan extensions are generally small compared to the inherent variability in mean lifespan even in isogenic populations housed under identical conditions. This variability makes reproducible detection of small but real effects experimentally challenging. In this study, we aimed to determine the reproducibility of C. elegans lifespan measurements under ideal conditions, in the absence of methodological errors or environmental or genetic background influences. To accomplish this, we generated a parametric model of C. elegans lifespan based on data collected from 5,026 wild-type N2 animals. We use this model to predict how different experimental practices, effect sizes, number of animals, and how different ‘shapes’ of survival curves affect the ability to reproduce real longevity effects. We find that the chances of reproducing real but small effects are exceedingly low and would require substantially more animals than are commonly used. Our results indicate that many lifespan studies are underpowered to detect reported changes and that, as a consequence, stochastic variation alone can account for many failures to reproduce longevity results. As a remedy, we provide power of detection tables that can be used as guidelines to plan experiments with statistical power to reliably detect real changes in lifespan and limit spurious false positive results. These considerations will improve best-practices in designing lifespan experiment to increase reproducibility.","",""

But the estimated average replicability rate of key-effects that top-tier psychology journals report falls between 36% and 39% (objective vs. subjective rate; Open Science Collaboration (2015)). So the standard mode of applying null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) fails to adequately separate stable from random effects. Therefore, NHST does not fully convince as a statistical inference strategy. We argue that the replicability crisis is “home-made” because more sophisticated strategies can deliver results the successful replication of which is sufficiently probable. Thus, we can overcome the replicability crisis by integrating empirical results into genuine research programs. Instead of continuing to narrowly evaluate only the stability of data against random fluctuations (discovery context), such programs evaluate rival hypotheses against stable data (justification context).",WOS:000413802900001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY

Setting Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical College, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, China. Methods In this prospective study, the central ACD in right pseudophakic eyes and right phakic eyes was measured with the Visante AS-OCT system and the OTI-Scan HF 35-50 UBM system. Intraexaminer repeatability and interexaminer reproducibility were evaluated in a subgroup of eyes from each group. The repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements were evaluated using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and the Bland-Altman method. Results The mean ACD in the 70 pseudophakic eyes was 3.91 mm ± 0.29 (SD) by AS-OCT and 3.76 ± 0.33 mm by UBM and in the 70 phakic eyes, 2.97 ± 0.31 mm and 2.90 ± 0.32 mm, respectively. The 95% limits of agreement between the 2 methods were −0.32 to 0.62 mm in pseudophakic eyes and −0.11 to 0.25 mm in phakic eyes. The ICC for the repeatability and reproducibility of AS-OCT and UBM measurements was high (range 0.985 to 0.996). Conclusions Both AS-OCT and UBM ACD measurements showed good repeatability and reproducibility. However, the agreement was better in phakic eyes than in pseudophakic eyes.

Radiation‐induced pulmonary function changes are assessed by comparing pulmonary function before and after radiation therapy (RT). Due to the probably different breath pattern and effort, uncertainties from 4DCT imaging and registration error, we need to first establish the measurement reproducibility. We also introduce gamma comparison method to compensate space disalignment in two distributions. Methods: Two repeated 4DCT data sets scanned with 30 minutes interval before RT from two patients are used in this study. Tissue volume preserving nonrigid registration algorithm with Laplacian regularization constraints was applied to register the maximum exhalation image to the maximum inhalation image for the calculation of local lung expansion as a measurement of regional pulmonary function in two scans. We compared the two pulmonary functions and analyzed the pulmonary function ratio map. Gamma comparison method is introduced to tolerate possible error in image acquisition and image registration. Mean and standard deviation of pulmonary function ratio map and gamma pass percent are calculated to measure reproducibility. Results: The registration accuracy analysis indicated our registration error is on the order of 1.0 mm. Most lungtissue has a reproducible pulmonary function. Reproducibility near the diaphragm is worse than other regions. The standard deviation of function ratio map is respectively 0.0352 and 0.0495. The gamma comparison pass percent is respectively 84% and 87%. Further plots suggest most of the lung function is reproducible in 2 scans. Conclusions: We analyzed the reproducibility to measure regional pulmonary function using 4DCT and image registration. We compared the regional lung function in two repeated 4DCT scan and discussed the function ratio map. We also introduced a gamma comparison method to quantify reproducibility.

The ensuing conversation reflects on the patient's treatment goals and the published information about the benefits and harms of the available options.

Every day, patients and their caregivers are faced with difficult decisions about treatment. They turn to physicians and other healthcare professionals to interpret the medical evidence and assist them in making individualized decisions.

In the author’s view, moreover, if in Klages this root receives nourishment from the universal symbolism of matter, that Klages intends as originally “auratic”, in Benjamin this root becomes the starting point through which, by means of artistic reproducibility, the human pattern moves away from the myth.","",""

However, the question is - is this really the case? In some application areas of simulation, e.g., cell biology, simulation studies cannot be published without data, models, methods, including computer code being made available for evaluation. With the applications and methodological areas of modeling and simulation, how the problem of reproducibility is assessed and addressed differs. The diversity of answers to this question will be illuminated by looking into the area of network simulations, simulation in logistics, in military, and health. Making different scientific cultures, different challenges, and different solutions in discrete event simulation explicit is central to improving the reproducibility and thus quality of discrete event simulation research.","",""

Forty-seven mothers of children aged 6 y completed two 3-d diet records and two FFQs over a 6-mo period. The FFQ asked the mothers how often, on average, their children consumed each of the 162 food items listed and what the usual serving size of each item was during the 6 mo prior to the study. Intakes of macro- and micronutrients were estimated by multiplying the frequency by the serving size for each food item. The validity of the FFQ was assessed by comparison of the two 3-d diet records. The reproducibility of the FFQ was based on the first and second FFQ administrations. The validity correlation ranged from 0.05 for α-tocopherol to 0.59 for retinol. The median correlation was 0.40. The reproducibility correlation was higher than 0.50 for all nutrients. For most nutrients, FFQ had acceptable reproducibility, whereas validity showed low to moderate correlations. Our FFQ could reasonably rank individuals according to dietary intake for epidemiologic studies, although the validity of the questionnaire is limited to specific nutrients.","",""

In this study we investigated approaches for improving motor unit number index (MUNIX) reproducibility. Methods: We used the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and the coefficient of variation (CV) to study reproducibility in healthy subjects. We tested reproducibility between test and retest of a single MUNIX from 3 different muscles (S-MUNIX) and also of the mean of a set of 3 measurements from these same muscles (M-MUNIX). Results: M-MUNIX was more reproducible than S-MUNIX. The CV showed a greater improvement than the ICC in all 3 muscles. Conclusions: M-MUNIX may be a valuable approach for following motor unit loss, because it is more replicable than MUNIX. This may be especially relevant in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients, in whom MUNIX variability is higher than in healthy individuals.

Setting Eye Hospital, Wenzhou Medical University, Wenzhou, China. Design Observational cross-sectional study. Methods One eye of normal subjects was measured 3 times using all devices. Another operator performed an additional 3 consecutive scans using the corneal topographer. One week later, the first operator repeated the corneal power measurements using the corneal topographer. Parameters were flat meridian power, steep meridian power, average power, J0, and J45. The repeatability and reproducibility of measurements were assessed by the within-subject standard deviation (S w ), repeatability (2.77 S w ), coefficient of variation (CoV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement between devices was assessed using 95% limits of agreement (LoA). Results Intraoperator repeatability and interoperator and intersession reproducibility of all measured parameters showed a CoV of less than 0.3%, a 2.77 S w of 0.32 diopter or less, and an ICC of more than 0.97. No significant differences in the parameters were noted between the corneal topographer and Scheimpflug camera. Statistically significant differences existed between the parameters analyzed by the corneal topographer and the automated keratometer, except J45. The mean differences between the corneal topographer and the other 2 devices were small, and the 95% LoA were narrow for all measurements.

The process self-corrects and distills knowledge by discarding false ideas and unsubstantiated claims. Although self-correction is inexorable in the long-term, in recent years biomedical scientists and the public alike have become alarmed and deeply troubled by the fact that many published results cannot be reproduced.

To assess the repeatability, reproducibility, and comparability of measurements of subjective and objective forward scattering in healthy subjects. Methods. We prospectively examined twenty eyes of 20 healthy volunteers (7 men and 13 women; ages, 28.4 ± 4.1 years). The logarithmic straylight value (log(s)) and the objective scattering index (OSI) were measured with a straylight meter (C-Quant) and a point-spread function meter (OQAS), respectively. Results. The 95% limits of agreement (LoA) between first and second measurements ranged from −0.211 to 0.207 for the C-Quant and from −0.302 to 0.477 for the OQAS. The intraclass correlation coefficients for the repeatability of the log(s) and OSI measurements were 0.815 and 0.926, respectively. The mean difference between examiners was −0.051 ± 0.133 (95% LoA; −0.311 to 0.209) for the C-Quant and 0.080 ± 0.307 (−0.522 to 0.682) for the OQAS. There was a modest, but significant, correlation between the log(s) and the OSI (Spearman correlation coefficient r = 0.498, p = 0.026). Conclusions.

The securitisation of science reorders the traditional split between the public sphere, the private sector and the commons. The folding of each one of these spheres into the other underlies a constant, often antagonistic, oscillation between big science and open science.

From pattern recognition in Hubble space telescope images of distant galaxies to field observations of migration patterns of birds in the rural areas of United States, the possibilities are countless. Certainly this new trend poses important problems and challenges, but it is also obvious that wide acceptance of citizen science can lead not only to great scientific results, but to the popularization of scientific method among the public. In the paper we examine the current state of citizen science, we outline some of the most interesting and difficult challenges in leading scientific projects on such scale, and we present typologies of citizen science projects. We also provide a survey of ICT tools available for citizen science projects.",WOS:000356936800016,WORLD WIDE WEB-INTERNET AND WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS

In this paper we present a new computational infrastructure called RunMyCode.org that is designed to support published articles by providing a dissemination platform for the code and data that generated the their results.

In their letter, Goldman and Silbergeld contend primarily that “replication” in science means to independently repeat a prior study to see if the same results can be obtained. They suggest that public availability of the prior study’s data is unnecessary because a subsequent study will generate its own data. In 2011, a special section of Science (Vol. 334, No. 6060) addressed replicability and reproducibility and made two general points. First, “replication,” as defined by Goldman and Silbergeld, while perhaps the cornerstone of the scientific method, can be difficult in many settings because of the uniqueness of the precise conditions surrounding field observations, the expense and time required to collect data (e.g., for longitudinal studies), and ethical constraints (e.g., Jasny et al. 2011). Second, in those cases where conduct of a second experiment may be impossible or infeasible, review and reanalysis of the first study’s data is still a meaningful step along the “reproducibility spectrum,” assists in understanding the differences between competing analyses, and “may be sufficient to verify the quality of the scientific claims” (Peng 2011; see also Ioannides and Khoury 2011; Santer et al. 2011).

Other empirical work also supports the view that data availability promotes reproducibility. In empirical economics, a discipline that uses large-scale statistical models broadly similar to those of epidemiologists, a famous study of replication of peer-reviewed research suggested that inadvertent errors may be “commonplace rather than rare occurrences” (Dewald et al. 1986). The American Economic Review (AER 2013) subsequently adopted a policy “to publish papers only if the data used in the analysis are clearly and precisely documented and are readily available to any researcher for purposes of replication.” Further, the AER conducted a recent evaluation of its policy and reported that about 80% of 39 sampled papers met the spirit of the data availability policy (Glandon 2010). Importantly, independent efforts at replication of 9 selected papers found no serious errors (almost exact replication for 5 studies and “several small discrepancies … immaterial to the conclusions” for another 4.) This result represents a marked improvement relative to the results of the original 1986 study of replication. The difference is presumably attributable, at least in part, to the difference in care and quality of work associated with the AER’s current policy of data availability. Although analytic methods underlying papers published in the AER are different from those used in chemical evaluation, the experience of the AER suggests that there is merit in promoting data availability for the purpose of improving the reliability of the results of published, peer-reviewed scientific papers, at least in disciplines that use complex statistical models.

Finally, we, like Goldman and Silbergeld, “disagree with the argument that raw data from every study used by the U.S. EPA to support a regulatory assessment should be made available to the agency and to the public.” Unlike Goldman and Silbergeld, we recom-mend that the U.S. EPA, when it uses results of a published study in a regulatory assessment, ask the authors for under-lying data (Lutter et al. 2013). If the U.S. EPA does not receive such data, it should explain how it used the study results in light of the fact that data sufficient to assess reproducibility was not forthcoming. We believe our approach would facilitate and not obstruct good science and that it would not discourage researchers from studying issues of importance in environ-mental health. Moreover, it would not, as Goldman and Silbergeld state,

limit the U.S. EPA from using the results of research published in the peer-reviewed scientific literature by placing studies off-limits if the authors did not submit raw data sets to the U.S. EPA.",WOS:000323706100007,ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES

Often little is known about the dependence structure and the marginal distribution of the data, motivating the development of a non-parametric approach to assess reproducibility. The procedure, which we call the Maximum Rank Reproducibility (MaRR) procedure, uses a maximum rank statistic to parse reproducible signals from noise without making assumptions about the distribution of reproducible signals. Because it uses the rank scale this procedure can be easily applied to a variety of data types. One application is to assess the reproducibility of RNA-seq technology using data produced by the Sequencing Quality Control (SEQC) consortium, which coordinated a multi-laboratory effort to assess reproducibility across three RNA-seq platforms (SEQC/MAQC-III Consortium (2014)).

This study was designed to explore the reproducibility of tumor volumes obtained by radiologist manual delineation (MAN), computer‐aided method (CAM) and computer alone (CA) using a same‐day repeat CT dataset of 32 non‐small cell lungcancer(NSCLC) patients. Methods: We used a publicly accessible repeat CT dataset aimed at studying cancer treatment response. Briefly, each patient was scanned twice within 15 minutes using the same imaging protocol and CT scanner (16‐ or 64‐row). Patients were repositioned before the second scan. Thin‐sectional images of 1.25mm slice interval were reconstructed using a shaper filter. Thirty‐two lesions (one per patient) were analyzed using the following three Methods: (1) MAN‐an experienced radiologist manually drew tumor contours on two repeat scans in a side‐by‐side mode, (2) CAM‐an operator applied a home‐grown algorithm to segment the tumors and the computer‐generated contours were reviewed/edited by the same radiologist, also in a side‐by‐side mode, and (3) CA‐an operator applied a different, also homegrown, algorithm to delineate tumor contours (no edit). Bland‐Altman plots were constructed to assess the agreement between volumes measured by each method on the two repeat scans. Volume difference between MAN and CA on each patient's first scan was analyzed using a paired t‐test. Results: The 95% limits of agreements for the tumor volumes made by MAN, CAM and CA on two repeat scans were (−19.9%, 19.6%), (−12.1%, 13.4%) and (−11.8%, 16.0%), respectively. The difference between tumor volumes measured by MAN and CA was not statistically significant (p=0.497). Conclusions: MAN is the least reproducible method for measuring tumor volumes compared to CAM and CA. The recommended way to obtain tumor volumes is to use a computer algorithm to segment tumors followed by radiologist's supervision.

Next, behavior modification strategies are discussed, pointing out that reward works better than punishment. Humans are utility seekers and the implementation of current change initiatives is hindered by high initial buy-in costs and insufficient expected utility. Open science tools interested in improving science should team up, to increase utility while lowering the cost and risk associated with engagement. The best way to realign individual and group motives will probably be to create one, centralized, easy to use, platform, with a profile, a feed of targeted science stories based upon previous system interaction, a sophisticated (public) discussion section, and impact metrics which use the associated data. These measures encourage high quality review and other prosocial activities while inhibiting self-serving behavior. Some advantages of centrally digitizing communications are outlined, including ways the data could be used to improve the peer review process.

In this article, we consider the performance of two types of (unbalanced) assessment plans. In each type, we use a standard plan augmented with a second component. In type A augmentation, each operator measures a different set of parts once each. In type B augmentation, each operator measures the same set of parts once each. The goal of the paper is to identify good augmented plans for estimating the gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&R), a ratio that compares the contribution of the measurement system to the overall process variation. We show that, if there are three or more operators or if we include the possibility of part-by-operator interaction, then use of an appropriate augmented plan can produce substantial gains in efficiency for estimating GR&R compared with the best standard plan with the same total number of measurements.","",""

The method is the phase shifting schlieren method, as embodied in the Nimo TR1504 instrument. Materials and methods Three Nimo TR1504 instruments were used to measure the power related dimensions of: (a) a range of custom toric rigid lenses; (b) a range of commercially available spherical hydrogel lenses; and (c) a commercially available range of toric silicone hydrogel lenses. The measurements were carried out using a standard ISO ring test protocol where independent tests were carried out under conditions of reproducibility. The analysis of the measurements was carried out using ISO methods which enabled the reproducibility standard deviation, SR, of the method to be calculated. Results The results show that this new method has SR of 0.048D for spherical soft (hydrogel) lenses. This means the back vertex power of spherical soft lenses having a power in the range ±10.0D can be determined to current ISO product tolerances with a single measurement. The method has SR of 0.059D for sphere power and 0.093D for cylinder power for toric soft lenses having powers in the range ±10.0D and cylinder powers in the range ±2.0D. A single measurement will determine sphere power to current ISO tolerance limits with 95% confidence while two measurements are required to determine the cylinder power to the same confidence level.",WOS:000298464500003,CONTACT LENS & ANTERIOR EYE

Many of these jobs are compute-intensive runs that benefit from submission to clusters at Purdue, TeraGrid, and Open Science Grid (OSG). Most of the nanoHUB users are not computational experts but end-users who expect complete and uninterrupted service. Within the ecology of grid computing resources, we need to manage the grid submissions of these users transparently with the highest possible degree of user satisfaction. In order to best utilize grid computing resources, we have developed a grid probe protocol to test the job submission system from end to end. Beginning in January 2009, we have collected a total of 1.2 million probe results from job submissions to TeraGrid, OSG, Purdue, and nanoHUB compute clusters. We then utilized these results to intelligently submit jobs to various grid sites using a model for probability of success based in part on probe test history. In this paper we present details of our grid probe model, results from the grid probe runs, and a discussion of data from production runs over the same time period. These results have allowed us to begin assessing our utilization of grid resources while providing our users with satisfactory outcomes.","",""

The findings of the project were published in December 2014 and the main points are summarised here. We found that scientists are motivated in their work to find out more about the world and to benefit society, and that they believe collaboration, multidisciplinarity, openness and creativity are important for the production of high quality science. However, in some cases, our findings suggest, the culture of research in higher education institutions does not support or encourage these goals or activities. For example, high levels of competition and perceptions about how scientists are assessed for jobs and funding are reportedly contributing to a loss of creativity in science, less collaboration and poor research practices. The project led to suggestions for action for funding bodies, research institutions, publishers and editors, professional bodies and individual researchers.","",""

The effects of Twitter on learning dynamics was tested in a field biology course offered by a large Canadian University: 29 students agreed to take part in the Twitter project and quantitative and qualitative data were collected, including survey data from 18 students. Students published 200% more public Tweets than what was required, and interacted frequently with the instructor and teaching assistant, their peers, and users external to the course. Almost 80% of students stated that Twitter increased opportunities for among-group communication, and 94% of students felt this kind of collaborative communication was beneficial to their learning. Although students did not think they would use Twitter after the course was over, 77% of the students still felt it was a good learning tool, and 67% of students felt Twitter had a positive impact on how they engaged with course content. These results suggest social media tools such as Twitter can help achieve active and collaborative learning in higher education.","",""

With the almost global availability of the Internet comes the expectation of universal accessibility to knowledge, including scientific knowledge-particularly that generated by public funding.

 Gutenberg's invention of the printing press in 1440 opened an avenue for the distribution of scholarly information to the entire world. The scientific literature first appeared in 1665 with Le Journal des Scavans followed in the same year by Philosophical Transactions. Today there are more than 5000 scientific publishing companies, 25,000 journals and 1.5 million articles published/year generating revenue of $25 billion USD.

 The European Union and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have argued for open access (OA) to scientific data for all publicly funded research by 2020 with a similar initiative in the USA via the Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act (FASTR). However, OA to published science is but one step in this odyssey. If the products of science are not openly available then it can be argued that the norms of science as defined by Merton including “universalism” and “communalism” have yet to be accomplished. Nowhere is this more apparent than in the delivery of medicines to the poor and for rare diseases, the attempts to privatize human genetic information and, not least, dealing with the challenges of antibiotic resistance and new disease pandemics exacerbated by climate change.",WOS:000396995000001,DRUG DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH

Near-infrared spectra of pure water and glycine solutions were used to quantify instrumental and spectral variations, and examine its influence on the reproducibility of difference spectra over a wide concentration range. Significant improvements were observed (fourfold), in comparison with the most commonly applied technique that uses an averaged spectrum of solvent. We propose a new technique, in which subtraction of the closest spectrum of solvent involves calculating the smallest area under the subtracted curve, to extract the optimal outcome. These results reveal that, contrary to common practice, reproducibility for spectra of diluted solutions can bypass even instrumental baseline shifts and render results that are limited only by the noise originating from the instrument's sensor.",WOS:000393242700008,ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA

We present the generic components of such workflows to provide a reference model for these stakeholders. The RDA-WDS Data Publishing Workflows group set out to study the current data-publishing workflow landscape across disciplines and institutions. A diverse set of workflows were examined to identify common components and standard practices, including basic self-publishing services, institutional data repositories, long-term projects, curated data repositories, and joint data journal and repository arrangements. The results of this examination have been used to derive a data-publishing reference model comprising generic components. From an assessment of the current data-publishing landscape, we highlight important gaps and challenges to consider, especially when dealing with more complex workflows and their integration into wider community frameworks. It is clear that the data-publishing landscape is varied and dynamic and that there are important gaps and challenges. The different components of a data-publishing system need to work, to the greatest extent possible, in a seamless and integrated way to support the evolution of commonly understood and utilized standards and--eventually--to increased reproducibility. We therefore advocate the implementation of existing standards for repositories and all parts of the data-publishing process, and the development of new standards where necessary. Effective and trustworthy data publishing should be embedded in documented workflows.

At first glance, these may seem quite unrelated – the former relates to ongoing concerns that many academic research findings may be incorrect [1], while the latter reflects the movement to encourage openness in science, through open access publication, open data archiving, and so on [2]. My argument is that the open science practices could in fact serve to improve the reproducibility of published work. Why do I think this?

It has been suggested that the incentive structures within which scientists operate may not promote behavior that maximizes the value of scientific research. Novel, groundbreaking results are more likely to be published in high-profile journals, and publication in these journals is more likely to lead to career advancement [3]. This may lead scientists to focus their resources on exploratory work, at the expense of confirmatory work. Researchers may also divide their resources into multiple projects, in the hope that this will increase the chances of one generating a novel result. This will mean that many studies may be underpowered, increasing the probability that a statistically significant finding is in fact a false positive [4]. Researchers may also exploit analytical flexibility to obtain a statistically significant finding (a process known as ‘p-hacking’), and then present these results as if they were anticipated a priori (also known as HARKing – Hypothesizing After the Results are Known). When results are perceived to be unexciting (i.e., null), researchers may be less inclined to devote time and effort to writing these up for publication [5], leading to widespread publication bias. The focus on positive results may also be reflected in citation biases, whereby those null results that are published received proportionately fewer citations than positive results on the same topic [6]. The consequence of this is a literature that is heavily skewed towards discovery rather than replication, and looks very unlike the totality of the activity that generated it.

There is clearly concern that these issues are undermining the value of science – in the UK the Academy of Medical Sciences recently convened a meeting, jointly with a number of other funders, to explore these issues, while in the US the National Institutes of Health has an ongoing initiative to improve research reproducibility [7]. How can these issues be addressed? There is scope for change at both the level of the wider incentive structures within which scientists operate, and at the level of the day-to-day activity of individual researchers and research groups. Funders and journals, for example, can mandate change – when the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute required the pre-registration of primary outcomes in clinical trials that they funded, the proportion of studies reporting a benefit of the intervention over the comparator declined dramatically, relative to studies published before this requirement [8]. A number of exciting initiatives are emerging. For example, several journals now offer a Registered Reports format [9], whereby acceptance in principle is offered on the basis of a detailed study protocol, prior to any data collection taking place, on the basis that the results of a well-designed study should always be informative and valuable. In principle, funders and journals could work together, offering acceptance in principle together with funding to conduct the research.

What can individual researchers and groups do? My group, the Tobacco and Alcohol Research Group, part of the MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit at the University of Bristol and the UK Centre for Tobacco Studies, has been gradually moving towards an open science model over the past few years. We now routinely pre-register studies that involved collection of new data on the Open Science Framework, and share the resulting data via the University of Bristol Research Data Repository (other non-institutional repositories also exist, such as the Open Science Framework and Mendeley Data). This has been a gradual process that has entailed updating a number of our internal procedures [2]. Moreover, it is an ongoing process – we are currently exploring sharing our study materials via platforms such as the Open Science Framework, and posting preprints of our work ahead of publication (for example on bioRxiv). Other enhancements to these processes are possible – for example, the use of research resource identifiers in subsequent publications should allow other researchers to identify exactly the materials used. In our opinion the benefits outweigh this modest effort. Not only is transparency and openness a valuable end in itself (particularly when research is publicly-funded), but it also serves as a quality control process. When researchers know that their study protocol or their data will be available for public scrutiny, they will be inclined to triple-check where previously they would have double-checked. Science is a human endeavour, and honest error is inevitable (witness typographical errors in published manuscripts, despite multiple rounds of peer review, proof reading, and so on). We need to embed processes in our work that help catch these errors, and foster an open culture whereby self-reporting of errors is encouraged.","",""

The movement toward a clinical research culture that supports data sharing has important implications for the design, conduct, and reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. While data sharing is likely to enhance the science of evidence synthesis, facilitating the identification and inclusion of all relevant research, it will also pose key challenges, such as requiring broader search strategies and more thorough scrutiny of identified research. Furthermore, the adoption of data sharing initiatives by the clinical research community should challenge the community of researchers involved in evidence synthesis to follow suit, including the widespread adoption of systematic review registration, results reporting, and data sharing, to promote transparency and enhance the integrity of the research process.","",""

Detailed studies of single species can identify fitness benefits of specific traits and why those traits evolved, but these results might be rather species specific. Thus, to reach general conclusions about which ecological factors favour the evolution of a specific trait, comparative studies in several taxa are needed. Currently, comparative studies arising from databases summarizing many field studies are flourishing and provide important insights for our understanding of social evolution [1–3]. Large, diverse datasets require detailed specialist knowledge in a wide variety of systems or taxa that is very rare, making it difficult to assess the quality of such databases. Referees of papers submitted to assess these comparative studies should review the part of the database for which they do have specialized knowledge. In some cases, studies with large databases could benefit from one additional referee that focuses only on the database itself, just as the views of specialized referees are often sought on aspects of statistical analysis or of animal ethics. In sum, the quality of a study depends on the quality of the data, and this is also the case for comparative studies.

A recently published comparative study in Royal Society Open Science about cooperative breeding in mammals [4] used a database previously used in a comparative study of the evolution of monogamy in the same taxa [5]. It had already been shown that for the third largest mammalian order, the Eulipotyphla, the information in this database is, to a large extent, inadequate [6]. In the supplement to their earlier publication on the evolution of social monogamy [5], Lukas & Clutton-Brock state that the database is the result of a systemic literature review on ‘mammalian species…collecting …",WOS:000412168900015,ROYAL SOCIETY OPEN SCIENCE

Open science and collaborative R&D may help [1]–[3]. Open science has been described as “a research accelerator” [4]. Open science implies open access [5] but goes beyond it: “Imagine a connected online web of scientific knowledge that integrates and connects data, computer code, chains of scientific reasoning, descriptions of open problems, and beyond …. tightly integrated with a scientific social web that directs scientists' attention where it is most valuable, releasing enormous collaborative potential.” [1].

Open science and collaborative approaches are often described as open source, by analogy with open-source software such as the operating system Linux which powers Google and Amazon—collaboratively created software which is free to use and adapt, and popular for Internet infrastructure and scientific research [6], [7]. However, this use of “open source” is unclear. Some people use “open source” when a project's results are free to use, others when a project's process is highly collaborative [4].

It is clearer to classify open source and open science within a broader class of collaborative R&D, which can be defined as scalable collaboration (usually enabled by information technology) across organizational boundaries to solve R&D challenges [8].

Many approaches to open science and collaborative R&D have been tried [1], [9]. The Gene Wiki has created over 10,000 Wikipedia articles, and aims to provide one for every notable human gene [10]. The crowdsourcing platform InnoCentive has reportedly facilitated solutions to roughly half of the thousands of technical problems posed on the site, including many in life sciences such as the $1 million ALS Biomarker Prize [11]. Other examples include prizes (X-Prize [12]), scientific games (FoldIt [13]), and licensing schemes inspired by open-source software (BIOS [14]).

Collaborative R&D approaches vary in openness [15]. In some approaches, the R&D process and outputs are open to all—for example, open-science projects like the Gene Wiki described above. In other approaches which demonstrate what might be called controlled collaboration, there are strong controls on who contributes and benefits—for example, computational platforms like Collaborative Drug Discovery or InnoCentive that support both commercial and nonprofit research [9], [11].

Collaborative approaches can unleash innovation from unforeseen sources, as with crowdsourcing health technologies [11]–[13], [16]. They may help in global challenges like drug development [17], as with India's OSDD (Open Source Drug Discovery) project that recruited over 7,000 volunteers [16] and an open-source drug synthesis project that improved an existing drug without increasing its cost [18].

If you want to apply open science and collaborative R&D, what principles are useful? We suggest Ten Simple Rules for Cultivating Open Science and Collaborative R&D. We also offer eight conversational interviews exploring life experiences that led to these rules (Box 1).


Box 1. Conversations on Open Science and Collaborative R&D
Many commentators have considered challenges in translating open science and collaborative methods to biomedical research [2]–[4], [9], [17], [20], [24], [26], [28], [29]. How can protecting intellectual property be balanced with freeing researchers to build on previous knowledge? If R&D results are collaboratively created and freely available, who will take responsibility for costly clinical trials and quality control? What will be the Linux of open-source R&D?

To explore such challenges and convey life experiences in biomedical open science and collaborative R&D, we offer eight conversational interviews by the first author of this article as supplementary material.

The system is modeled as a stability graph in which the vertices correspond to testbed nodes and there is an edge between two vertices if their communication is classified as stable. We investigate the performance of different topologies embedded in the stability graph to run experiments on PlanetLab. Results show that the k-core outperforms the other strategies in terms of their impact on the performance and reproducibility of the experiments. A k-core is a maximal subgraph of G in which all vertices have degree at least k.

Despite predictions of a revolution, the academic publishing sector has proved remarkably resilient in adapting to market changes.

In order to derive meaningful noble gas temperatures (NGTs) from speleothem fluid inclusions, precise and accurate measurements of noble gas concentrations on very small water samples are necessary. To optimise these measurements and their reliability, an investigation of the reproducibility and accuracy of the analytical procedure is essential.

METHODS
Water equilibrated with air under controlled conditions was filled into copper capillaries to produce small (about 1 μL) air-equilibrated water samples (so-called μAEWs). As speleothem samples, the μAEWs were opened in a crusher and the released noble gases analysed with an electron ionisation sector field mass spectrometer run in static mode. For better comparability with speleothem samples, a defined amount of air was added to the noble gases derived from one group of μAEWs.

RESULTS
The reproducibility of the experimental procedure was found to be better than 2.2% for all relevant noble gases. Within these uncertainties, the measured noble gas concentrations of μAEWs agree with expectations. The corresponding NGTs reproduce within 0.5°C and deviate by less than 1°C from the equilibration temperature. In the case of air addition, the air to water ratio was determined accurately and, excluding one outlier, the NGTs were determined with a reproducibility and accuracy well below 1°C.

CONCLUSIONS
The results show that the used measurement procedure is generally suitable to reveal major climatic temperature changes, for which an overall NGT error of less than 1°C is desirable, from very small water samples as obtained from speleothem fluid inclusions.

Despite its versatility in various measurement systems, 2D correlation has not yet become popular in separation science. 2D correlation is seldom used in chromatography; only a few a studies can be found on this topic and most of those publications report about gel chromatography. In the present study, 2D correlation analysis is applied to chromatograms. In this study, a simple method is built for studying the similarities and dissimilarities between a number of chromatograms. We present the applicability of the method by two examples, where the repeatability and reproducibility of the analytical and nonlinear measurements in HPLC are evaluated and demonstrated. In order to validate the results of 2D correlation analysis, they are compared to principal component analysis (PCA). We confirm the equivalence in the interpretation of the results obtained with the two methods of calculation.

If clinical code lists are not available, reviewers are unable to determine the validity of research, full study replication is impossible, researchers are unable to make effective comparisons between studies, and the construction of new code lists is subject to much duplication of effort. Despite this, the publication of clinical codes is rarely if ever a requirement for obtaining grants, validating protocols, or publishing research. In a representative sample of 450 EMR primary research articles indexed on PubMed, we found that only 19 (5.1%) were accompanied by a full set of published clinical codes and 32 (8.6%) stated that code lists were available on request. To help address these problems, we have built an online repository where researchers using EMRs can upload and download lists of clinical codes. The repository will enable clinical researchers to better validate EMR studies, build on previous code lists and compare disease definitions across studies. It will also assist health informaticians in replicating database studies, tracking changes in disease definitions or clinical coding practice through time and sharing clinical code information across platforms and data sources as research objects.",WOS:000338508200043,PLOS ONE

Color measurement was performed using a spectrophotometer for the prepared specimens. The differences in shade in relation to the build-up method were calculated by quantifying ΔE* (mean color difference), with the use of color difference equations representing the distance from the measured values L*, a*, and b*, to the three-dimensional space of two colors. Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) combined with a Tukey multiple-range test was used to analyze the data (α=0.05). RESULTS. In comparing means and standard deviations of L*, a*, and b* color values there was no significant difference by the manufacturing method and zirconia core thickness according to a two-way ANOVA. The color differences between two manufacturing methods were in a clinically acceptable range less than or equal to 3.7 in all the specimens. CONCLUSION. Based on the results of this study, a carefully consideration is necessary while selecting upper porcelain materials, even if it is performed on a small scale. However, because the color reproducibility of the digital veneering system was within the clinically acceptable range when comparing with conventional layering system, it was possible to estimate the possibility of successful aesthetic prostheses in the latest technology.

Method: A detailed literature search was undertaken to trace articles reporting on the validity and/or reproducibility of food records, food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and 24-hour recalls for the dietary assessment of adolescents, especially among South Africans, in the following databases: Medline, Science Direct, Academic Search Premier, Health Source, PubMed and the South African e-publications database (SAE). Original studies published between 1990 and 2009, and relevant original articles published before 1990, were included. Of these, only three were South African-based studies reporting testing for reproducibility and/or validity. Results: Results indicated that adolescents comply better with estimated food records than with weighed food records. However, energy intake was underestimated in adolescents (by 18–42%) when using food record methods. The relative validity of FFQs among adolescents was moderate, with correlation coefficients of > 0.3 for most measured nutrients and food items. Reproducibility was fair to good among female adolescents (0.3–0.83) for most nutrients and foods, but was lower in a South African Tswana-speaking group. The 24-hour recall method showed the least over- and underestimation of all the reviewed methods. When comparing the 24-hour recall method to an observed intake method among adolescents, < 11% underestimation of energy intake was found, while < 4% underestimation was found when the 24-hour recall method was tested against the doubly labelled water method. Conclusion: Based on these outcomes it was concluded that FFQs and 24-hour recalls are valid and reproducible dietary assessment methods that can be used when collecting dietary data from adolescents. Factors to consider when choosing the best suitable method should include the gender and ethnicity of the population as well as the time frame for the collection of dietary data.","",""

However it is also true that some of the modern methodologies do not reduce or prevent school failure. Perhaps the real limitation is the inability to identify the true reasons that may explain it or ignore/undervalue the problem.

Methods setting: Clinical practice. study population: Macular thickness was assessed in 18 randomly chosen consecutive eyes of 18 healthy volunteers by 2 masked operators using 6 SD OCT devices and 1 time-domain OCT device. main outcome measures: Intraoperator and interoperator reproducibility of OCT-measured central macular thickness. Results Mean macular thickness ranged from 172.77 to 272.87 μm. Intraobserver Intraclass coefficient correlation ranged from 0.75 to 0.96. Intraobserver coefficient of variation ranged from 0.44 to 2.75. In Bland-Altman analysis, interoperator mean difference ranged from 0.22 to −9.69. An analysis of variance used for repeated measurement was statistically significant for instruments ( P P = .04), but not for instruments × operators ( P = .32). Conclusions The 7 OCT devices presented differing macular thickness measurement values; the lowest value was with Copernicus, and the highest was with Spectralis HRA+OCT (Heidelberg Engineering). The new generation of SD OCT devices has good intraoperator reproducibility, but the Spectralis presents the highest reproducibility together with the best interoperator agreement. The software, and in particular the algorithm, used is the most important factor regarding reproducibility differences in macular thickness measurement. The main result of our study is that macular thickness absolute value differs for each device. For this reason, the devices are not interchangeable.",WOS:000280697800010,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY

Methods A total of 43 cone-beam computed tomographic scans (14 men and 29 women, mean age of 54.6 ± 8.5 years) were analyzed by 3 observers. Intraobserver reproducibility and interobserver reliability were assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient. Parametric correlation between manual and automated volumetric measurements was performed. In addition, the Student t test was also used to compare the mean time required for manual and automated volumetric measurements. Results Automated segmentation showed slightly higher intraclass correlation coefficient values for all observers. A strong significant correlation was found between manual and automated volumetric measurements performed by the 3 observers. A significant difference in the mean procedure time was also found between both methods ( P  = .001). Conclusions Within the limitations of this study, the present results suggest that automated segmentation with a region growing algorithm is faster and slightly more reliable to calculate the volume of periapical lesions.",WOS:000361082300031,JOURNAL OF ENDODONTICS

Usually, this is done manually by several human coders, which makes the process time consuming, expensive, and often neither replicable nor accurate. In an attempt to mitigate these problems, we perform a feasibility study investigating the applicability of computer-aided content analysis techniques onto the domain of accounting research. Krippendorff (1980) defines an algorithm's reliability as its stability, reproducibility and accuracy. Since in computer-aided text classification, which is inherently objective and repeatable, the first two requirements, stability and reproducibility, are not an issue, this paper focuses exclusively on the third requirement, the algorithm's accuracy. It is important to note that, although inaccurate classification results are completely worthless, it is surprising to see how few research papers actually mention the accuracy of the used classification methodology. After a survey of the available techniques, we perform an in depth analysis of the most promising one, LPU (Learning from Positive and Unlabelled), which turns out to have an F-value and accuracy of about 90%, which means that, given a random text, it has a 90% probability of classifying it correctly.",WOS:000292169500153,EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS

From the early days of development, research libraries have joined different networks and been among the most active stakeholders working towards open science. Cohesive networks are needed for coordinated actions and support, whereas bridging networks can provide new approaches and novel information. The Finnish Open Science and Research Initiative is presented in this paper as an example of joining networks, motivating individuals and organisations to deliver high-quality services, infrastructures and competence building to promote a transition towards open science. This paper also presents milestones such as the publication of the academic publishing costs of Finnish research organisations and the maturity level of open science operating cultures in HEIs. Based on the experience of the Finnish open science initiative, joining different networks at the national level on an open mode of operation can significantly speed up the transition towards the era of open science.","",""

Methods Measurements were performed using a computer numerical control coordinate measuring machine (CNCCMM) of the reference models as a control. Subsequently, intraoral scanners and a laboratory scanner were used for measurements of the reference trueness and precision of the distance were evaluated by image analyzing software. Results With regard to reference model, there was a significant difference between in the trueness measured by C.O.S. (COS) and that measured by the other scanners. The trueness measured by the second-generation 3M™ true definition scanner (TDS2) and third-generation 3M™ true definition scanner (TDS3) was bigger than the one by TRIOS (TR) and KaVo (KA). With regard to reference model “B,” error of the trueness measured by COS was significantly bigger, compared with the one measured by the other scanners. However, error range of intraoral scanners, except for COS, was considerably small and it should be covered with cement space.

The correlation of phenotypic outcomes with genetic variation and environmental factors is a core pursuit in biology and biomedicine. Numerous challenges impede our progress: patient phenotypes may not match known diseases, candidate variants may be in genes that have not been characterized, model organisms may not recapitulate human or veterinary diseases, filling evolutionary gaps is difficult, and many resources must be queried to find potentially significant genotype-phenotype associations. Nonhuman organisms have proven instrumental in revealing biological mechanisms. Advanced informatics tools can identify phenotypically relevant disease models in research and diagnostic contexts. Large-scale integration of model organism and clinical research data can provide a breadth of knowledge not available from individual sources and can provide contextualization of data back to these sources. The Monarch Initiative (monarchinitiative.org) is a collaborative, open science effort that aims to semantically integrate genotype-phenotype data from many species and sources in order to support precision medicine, disease modeling, and mechanistic exploration.

According to a recent survey in Nature, over 70% of researchers have failed in reproducing another scientist’s results and more than half have failed in trying to reproduce their own results. But replication of scientific results is the heart of the scientific method; without this cornerstone we do not have science, we have faith and mysticism. Note, however, that reproducibility comes at a steep cost: more rigor, more scrutiny, and tightened controls on what is considered a publishable result will doubtless burden scientists and slow the pace of innovation. In this talk I will discuss the roots of replication problems-replication bias, null aversion, and incentive structures for researchers-and their implications on reproducibility for the field of software engineering. Finally, I will present a few ideas on how we can think about improving the state of our discipline.","",""

Tissue elasticity information, tracked over the course of therapy, may be an important prognostic indicator of tumor response to treatment. While many elastography techniques exist, this work reports on the use of a novel form of elastography that uses image texture to reconstruct elastic property distributions in tissue (i.e., a modality independent elastography (MIE) method) within the context of a pre-clinical breast cancer system. 1,2 The elasticity results have previously shown good correlation with independent mechanical testing. 1 Furthermore, MIE has been successfully utilized to localize and characterize lesions in both phantom experiments and simulation experiments with clinical data. 2,3 However, the reproducibility of this method has not been characterized in previous work. The goal of this study is to evaluate voxel-level reproducibility of MIE in a pre-clinical model of breast cancer. Bland-Altman analysis of co-registered repeat MIE scans in this preliminary study showed a reproducibility index of 24.7% (scaled to a percent of maximum stiffness) at the voxel level. As opposed to many reports in the magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) literature that speak to reproducibility measures of the bulk organ, these results establish MIE reproducibility at the voxel level; i.e., the reproducibility of locally-defined mechanical property measurements throughout the tumor volume.",WOS:000355665600003,"MEDICAL IMAGING 2015: BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS IN MOLECULAR, STRUCTURAL, AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING"

Recently, a noninvasive technique was proposed which estimates global CMRO2 by concomitantly measuring oxygenextraction-fraction using T2-relaxation-under-spin-tagging MRI and pulse oximetry, and cerebral-blood-flow using phase-contrast MRI. This study sought to establish a standard acquisition procedure for this technique and to evaluate its test–retest reproducibility in healthy subjects. Each subject was examined in five sessions and each session included two measurements. Intrasession, intersession, and intersubject coefficients of variation for CMRO2 were found to be 3.84 6 1.44% (N 5 7, mean 6 standard deviation), 6.59 6 1.56%, and 8.80% respectively. These reproducibility values were comparable or slightly superior to 15 O positron emission tomography (PET) results reported in the literature. It was also found that oxygen-extraction-fraction and cerebral-blood-flow tended to covary across sessions (P 5 0.002) and subjects (P 5 0.01), and their coefficients of variation were greater than that of CMRO2. The simplicity and reliability features may afford this global CMRO2 technique great potential for immediate clinical applications. Magn Reson Med 69:675–681, 2013.

Since its inception in 2000, BOSC has provided bioinformatics developers with a forum for communicating the results of their latest efforts to the wider research community, and a focused environment for developers and users to interact and share ideas about standards, software development practices and practical techniques for solving bioinformatics problems. BOSC includes a 2 day ‘CodeFest’ preceding the formal conference, which provides a venue for developers to meet in person to work on or plan joint projects (Moller et al., 2013).

The session topics at BOSC 2013 included Cloud and Parallel Computing, Visualization, Software Interoperability, Genome-scale Data Management, a session for updates on ongoing Open Source projects and two new sessions: Open Science and Reproducible Research and Translational Bioinformatics, recognizing the growing use of computational biology in medical applications. Slides from all of the presentations are available on the BOSC Web site, along with some of the posters and video recordings for selected talks, including the keynotes and panel discussion.

Open Science is a movement dedicated to making all aspects of scientific knowledge production freely available for reuse and extension, including scientific data, methods and analyses. In response to the increasing traction that this movement has gained, BOSC 2013 featured a new session devoted explicitly to Open Science. One of the objectives of Open Science is the wider issue of making published research reproducible. Aside from openness in software licensing, this also includes openness of data and unhindered access to scientific papers themselves (Open Access). When researchers can freely access publications and the source code and data that support them, it becomes possible for them to recreate the steps that the authors went through to reach their conclusions and to then go beyond them. In this way, Open Science not only stands to provide the value of validating published results by recreating them but also to accelerate the pace of scientific discovery, by enabling researchers to more effectively build on the results of previous work, rather than having to reinvent tools and reassemble datasets.

Each day of BOSC traditionally starts off with a keynote talk by a person of influence in Open Source bioinformatics. BOSC 2013’s first keynote speaker was Cameron Neylon, the Advocacy Director for the Public Library of Science, who is a prominent advocate for open science. Neylon discussed the cultural issues that are hindering open science, and spoke about the potential of openness in scientific collaborations for generating impact. Our second keynote speaker was Sean Eddy, a group leader at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Janelia Farm, who is perhaps best known as the author of the HMMER software suite (Eddy, 2011). He discussed how his own experience and practices show that dedicating effort to thorough engineering in tool development—which is often shunned as uninteresting and unpublishable—can be a key to creating a lasting impact.

To stimulate discussion on controversial or multifaceted topics, BOSC includes a panel, in which panelists representing a range of viewpoints, answer questions from the audience. This year’s panel was on Strategies for Funding and Maintaining Open Source Software. To secure continued funding for a software project, researchers must be able to demonstrate its impact. The panelists explored ways to quantify usage of one’s software as a measure of impact. They agreed that traditional publications, and tracking their citations, still play an important role in publicizing and demonstrating the use of one’s software, but they are not the only metric.

With the increasing reliance of more and more fields of biology on computational tools to manage and analyze their data, BOSC seems assured to stay relevant to life science, and thus to life scientists.

To compare the standard methods for ultrasound measurement of fetal head circumference (HC) and biparietal diameter (BPD) (outer-to-outer (BPDoo) vs outer-to-inner (BPDoi) caliper placement), and compare acquisition of these measurements in transthalamic (TT) vs transventricular (TV) planes.

Methods
This study utilized ultrasound images acquired from women participating in the Oxford arm of the INTERGROWTH-21st Project. In the first phase of the study, BPDoo and BPDoi were measured on stored images. In the second phase, real-time measurements of BPD, occipitofrontal diameter (OFD) and HC in TT and TV planes were obtained by pairs of sonographers. Reproducibility of measurements made by the same (intraobserver) and by different (interobserver) sonographers, as well as the reproducibility of caliper placement and measurements obtained in different planes, was assessed using Bland–Altman plots.

Results
In Phase I, we analyzed ultrasound images of 108 singleton fetuses. The mean intraobserver and interobserver differences were < 2% (1.34 mm) and the 95% limits of agreement were < 5% (3 mm) for both BPDoo and BPDoi. Neither method for measuring BPD showed consistently better reproducibility. In Phase II, we analyzed ultrasound images of 100 different singleton fetuses. The mean intraobserver and interobserver differences were < 1% (2.26 mm) and the 95% limits of agreement were < 8% (14.45 mm) for all fetal head measurements obtained in TV and TT planes. Neither plane for measuring fetal head showed consistently better reproducibility. Measurement of HC using the ellipse facility was as reproducible as HC calculated from BPD and OFD. OFD by itself was the least reproducible of all fetal head measurements.

Conclusions
Measurements of BPDoi and BPDoo are equally reproducible; however, we believe BPDoo should be used in clinical practice as it allows fetal HC to be measured and compared with neonatal HC. For all head measurements, TV and TT planes provide equally reproducible values at any gestational age, and HC values are similar in both planes. Fetal head measurement in the TT plane is preferable as international standards in this plane are available; however, measurements in the TV plane can be plotted on the same standards.

Material and methods: In order to assess the repeatability and reproducibility, independent measurements on the ultra­sound image were taken by two specialists on 92 female patients at rest and at strain (Valsalva maneuver). 2D ultrasound examination was performed introitally with a transvaginal probe (PFS-TV). The location of the urethral internal orifice was defined with coordinates of two points. Point CI marks the urethral anterior edge visualized on ultrasound as closer to the pubic symphysis. Point CII marks the posterior edge visualized more peripherally from pubic symphysis. Results: Repeatability and reproducibility measurements of point CI location and mobility were good and very good (0.6710–0.9961), while of point CII — were medium, good and very good (0.5738–0.9944). Point CI was clearly visible in all cases. It was not possible to accurately mark point CII in 4.3–17.4% of cases. Conclusions: The possibility to visualize point CI in every single case with very good and good repeatability and reproduc­ibility of measurements of this point’s location and mobility allows the usage of CI point as a universal reference point for evaluation of bladder neck mobility and position during PFS-TV in the clinical practice and for research purposes.",WOS:000408256500004,GINEKOLOGIA POLSKA

The study population consisted of 13 patients examined with spiral 3D computed tomography (CT). We used a previously validated low-dose CT protocol. For each analysis, 22 cephalometric reference landmarks were identified on 3D CT surface renderings. Forty-four reference landmarks were identified per patient. Two series of identifications were performed by two independent observers. In total, 3432 imaging measurements were completed. The intra-observer reconstructed mean log was 1.210+/-1.042mm for the 3D-ACRO analysis, and 1.311+/-1.042mm for 3D-Swennen analysis (comparison: p=0.17 NS). The inter-observer reconstructed mean log was 1.799+/-1.037mm for the 3D-ACRO analysis, and 2.465+/-1.036mm for 3D-Swennen analysis (comparison: p=0.000000002). The difference between the intra- and inter-observer reconstructed mean logs were 1.486+/-1.057mm for 3D-ACRO and 1.880+/-1.056mm for 3D-Swennen analysis. In conclusions: 3D-ACRO analysis was significantly more reproducible than 3D-Swennen analysis (p=0.0027) due to the use of a majority of highly reproducible cephalometric landmarks. Finally, we propose a classification scheme and exclusion criteria for reference landmarks used in 3D cephalometrics, based on inter-observer reproducibility and anatomical reality.",WOS:000276277700011,JOURNAL OF CRANIO-MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY

The aim of this study is to determine the reliability of corneal thickness measurements derived from SOCT Copernicus HR (Fourier domain OCT).



Methods

Thirty healthy eyes of 30 subjects were evaluated. One eye of each patient was chosen randomly. Images were obtained of the central (up to 2.0 mm from the corneal apex) and paracentral (2.0 to 4.0 mm) cornea. We assessed corneal thickness (central and paracentral) and epithelium thickness. The intra-observer repeatability data were analysed using the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) for a range of 95 per cent within-subject standard deviation (SW) and the within-subject coefficient of variation (CW). The level of agreement by Bland–Altman analysis was also represented for the study of the reproducibility between observers and agreement between methods of measurement (automatic versus manual).



Results

The mean value of the central corneal thickness (CCT) was 542.4 ± 30.1 μm (SD). There was a high intra-observer agreement, finding the best result in the central sector with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.99, 95 per cent CI (0.989 to 0.997) and the worst, in the minimum corneal thickness, with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.672, 95 per cent CI (0.417 to 0.829). Reproducibility between observers was very high. The best result was found in the central sector thickness obtained both manually and automatically with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.990 in both cases and the worst result in the maximum corneal thickness with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.827. The agreement between measurement methods was also very high with intra-class correlation coefficient greater than 0.91. On the other hand the repeatability and reproducibility for epithelial measurements was poor.



Conclusion

Pachymetric mapping with SOCT Copernicus HR was found to be highly repeatable and reproducible. We found that the device lacks an appropriate ergonomic design as proper focusing of the laser beam onto the cornea for anterior segment scanning required that patients were positioned slightly farther away from the machine head-rest than in the setup for retinal imaging.",WOS:000318627000005,CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OPTOMETRY

However, with the deployment of multiple disconnected Grid environments, we are now faced with the problem of interoperable access to resources from multiple environments to meet the requirements of scientific applications. Within the U. S. cyberinfrastructure environments, two key elements: both the National Science Foundation TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid (OSG) provide varied but important capabilities and resources needed by diverse computational communities. Hence, it is critical to understand how these communities can benefit from bridging these different environments and utilize them when needed. In this paper we present a novel approach to interoperable access to both OSG and TeraGrid to users through the CyberGIS Gateway -- an online geographic information system. In particular, five key interoperability themes are addressed: authentication and authorization, information services, data management, and computation management and auditing. We take a scientific application use-case (viewshed analysis) on the CyberGIS Gateway to demonstrate how to exploit resources on both OSG and TeraGrid.","",""

A survey on open access with scientists from the French National Research Center (CNRS),1,"Purpose
This paper aims to present empirical evidence on the opinion and behaviour of French scientists (senior management level) regarding open access (OA) to scientific and technical information.

Design/methodology/approach
The results are part of a nationwide survey on scientific information and documentation with 432 directors of French public research laboratories conducted by the French National Research Center (CNRS) in 2014.

Findings
The CNRS senior research managers (laboratory directors) globally share the positive opinion towards OA revealed by other studies with researchers from the UK, Germany, the USA and other countries. However, they are more supportive of open repositories (green road) than of OA journal publishing (gold). The response patterns reveal a gap between generally positive opinions about OA and less supportive behaviours, principally publishing articles with article processing charges (APCs). A small group of senior research managers does not seem to be interested in green or gold OA and reluctant to self-archiving and OA publishing. Similar to other studies, the French survey confirms disciplinary differences, i.e. a stronger support for self-archiving of records and documents in HAL by scientists from Mathematics, Physics and Informatics than from Biology, Earth Sciences and Chemistry; and more experience and positive feelings with OA publishing and payment of APCs in Biology than in Mathematics or in Social Sciences and Humanities. Disciplinary differences and specific French factors are discussed, in particular in the context of the new European policy in favour of Open Science.

Originality/value
For the first time, a nationwide survey was conducted with the senior research management level from all scientific disciplines. The response rate was high (>30 per cent), and the results provide good insight into the real awareness, support and uptake of OA by senior research managers who provide both models (examples for good practice) and opinion leadership.",WOS:000390712000002,INTERLENDING & DOCUMENT SUPPLY

Authenticity refers to the utopian ideas of 'purity,' 'unity,' 'truth,' and 'originality' that dominated avant-garde aesthetics in the early twentieth century. Since then, 'authentic' artworks commonly either hint at an inaccessible origin beyond their medial status (auratic art) or emphasize their mediality by declaring the elements of art their 'truth' (reproducible art).

This paper aims to describe the evolution of scientific communication, largely represented by the publication process. It notes the disappearance of the traditional publication on paper and its progressive replacement by electronic publishing, a new paradigm implying radical changes in the whole mechanism. It aims also at warning the scientific community about the dangers of some new avenues and why, rather than subcontracting an essential part of its work, it must take back full control of its production.




Design/methodology/approach




The paper reviews the emerging concepts in scholarly publication and aims to answer frequently asked questions concerning free access to scientific literature as well as to data, science and knowledge in general.




Findings




The paper provides new observations concerning the level of compliance to institutional open access mandates and the poor relevance of journal prestige for quality evaluation of research and researchers. The results of introducing an open access policy at the University of Liege are noted.




Social implications




Open access is, for the first time in human history, an opportunity to provide free access to knowledge universally, regardless of either the wealth or the social status of the potentially interested readers. It is an essential breakthrough for developing countries.




Originality/value




Open access and Open Science in general must be considered as common values that should be shared freely. Free access to publicly generated knowledge should be explicitly included in universal human rights. There are still a number of obstacles hampering this goal, mostly the greed of intermediaries who persuade researchers to give their work for free, in exchange for prestige. The worldwide cause of Open Knowledge is thus a major universal issue for the twenty-first century.",WOS:000390712000004,INTERLENDING & DOCUMENT SUPPLY

One purpose of quality parameters is for the comparison of observations, but when dissimilar methods for estimating quality terms are utilized, a comparison is misrepresented. A standardized approach to estimating uncertainty provides a basis for meeting measurement requirements and providing a level of confidence for observations. Here, we show the approach used by the National Ecological Observatory Network to estimate uncertainty of the calibration processes and measurements illustrated with an example of uncertainty assessment on a temperature sensor. Detailing the approach for uncertainty assessment provides the transparency necessary for network science and allows for the approach to be adopted in the scientific community.

The estimated sharing rate was not far from totality (97.6% ± 2.1%) and substantially higher than observed in other fields of genetic research (evolutionary, medical and forensic genetics). Both a questionnaire-based survey and the examination of Journals’ editorial policies suggest that this high sharing rate cannot be simply explained by the need to comply with stakeholders requests. Most data were made available through body text, but the use of primary databases increased in coincidence with the introduction of complete mitochondrial and next-generation sequencing methods. Our study highlights three important aspects. First, our results imply that researchers’ awareness of the importance of openness and transparency for scientific progress may complement stakeholders’ policies in achieving very high sharing rates. Second, widespread data sharing does not necessarily coincide with a prevalent use of practices which maximize data findability, accessibility, useability and preservation. A detailed look at the different ways in which data are released can be very useful to detect failures to adopt the best sharing modalities and understand how to correct them. Third and finally, the case of human paleogenetics tells us that a widespread awareness of the importance of Open Science may be important to build reliable scientific practices even in the presence of complex experimental challenges.",WOS:000351987300248,PLOS ONE

However, by reducing within-experiment variation, standardization may limit inference to the specific experimental conditions. Indeed, we have recently shown in mice that standardization may generate spurious results in behavioral tests, accounting for poor reproducibility, and that this can be avoided by population heterogenization through systematic variation of experimental conditions. Here, we examined whether a simple form of heterogenization effectively improves reproducibility of test results in a multi-laboratory situation. Each of six laboratories independently ordered 64 female mice of two inbred strains (C57BL/6NCrl, DBA/2NCrl) and examined them for strain differences in five commonly used behavioral tests under two different experimental designs. In the standardized design, experimental conditions were standardized as much as possible in each laboratory, while they were systematically varied with respect to the animals' test age and cage enrichment in the heterogenized design. Although heterogenization tended to improve reproducibility by increasing within-experiment variation relative to between-experiment variation, the effect was too weak to account for the large variation between laboratories. However, our findings confirm the potential of systematic heterogenization for improving reproducibility of animal experiments and highlight the need for effective and practicable heterogenization strategies.",WOS:000286834300066,PLOS ONE

Methods: Following the standard array calibration procedure, two additional 10 × 10 cm exposures were acquired for each array axis with the detector array shifted by ±10 cm in the transverse or axial axes, or by ±10 2 cm in the positive or negative diagonal axes. These exposures were compared with a final baseline 10 × 10 cm exposure captured with the detector repositioned at the isocenter. The measurements were used to calculate a linear off-axis correction gradient which was then applied to the stored calibration factors. Results: The mean coefficient of variation between five repeat calibrations was reduced from 4.17% to 0.48% and the maximum percentage error in individual calibration factors was reduced from 6.46% to 0.77%. Conclusions: The reproducibility of the calibration factors of an ionization chamber array was increased by capturing a baseline exposure and two further off-axis readings per calibration axis.",WOS:000342204800007,MEDICAL PHYSICS

In the context of a rapidly increasing prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, fruit and vegetables could play a key preventive role. To date, there is no rapid assessment tool available for measuring the fruit and vegetable intakes of North-African women. The present study aimed to investigate the reproducibility and relative validity of an eight-item quantitative food frequency questionnaire that measures the fruit and vegetable intakes (FV-FFQ) of Moroccan women.



Methods

During a 1-week period, 100 women, living in the city of Rabat, Morocco (aged 20–49 years) completed the short FV-FFQ twice: once at baseline (FV-FFQ1) and once at the end of the study (FV-FFQ2). In the mean time, participants completed three 24-h dietary recalls. All questionnaires were administered by interviewers. Reproducibility was assessed by computing Spearman's correlation coefficients, intraclass correlation (ICC) coefficients and kappa statistics. Relative validity was assessed by computing Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and Spearman's correlation coefficients, as well as by performing Bland–Altman plots.



Results

In terms of reproducibility, Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.56; ICC coefficient was 0.68; and weighted kappa was 0.35. In terms of relative validity, compared with the three 24-h recalls, the FV-FFQ slightly underestimated mean fruit and vegetable intakes (−10.9%; P = 0.006); Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.69; at the individual level, intakes measured by the FV-FFQ were between 0.39 and 2.19 times those measured by the 24-h recalls.



Conclusions

The brief eight-item FV-FFQ is a reliable and relatively valid tool for measuring mean fruit and vegetable intakes at the population level, although this is not the case at the individual level.",WOS:000333409800019,JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS

Aim: To assess interobserver reproducibility of Gleason grading of prostatic adenocarcinoma. Design: A total of 20 cases of prostatic adenocarcinoma were scored using Gleason grade by 21 general pathologists. The scores were then compared using κ-coefficient and consensus score. Results: For Gleason score groups (2-4, 5-6, 7 and 8-10) overall agreement with consensus score was 68%. Exact agreement for Gleason scores with consensus score was 43.3% and 92.3% within ±1 of the consensus score. κ coefficient for primary grade ranged from -0.32 to 0.92 with 60% of the readings in fair to moderate agreement range; and for secondary grade κ ranged from -0.30 to 0.62 with 78% of the readings in slight to fair agreement range. Kappa for Gleason scores ranged from -0.13 to 0.55 with 80% of the readings in slight to fair agreement range; and for Gleason score groups κ ranged from -0.11 to 0.82 with 68.5% of the readings in fair to moderate agreement range.

Evidence shows that IP protection has become a norm for universities and GRIs throughout the world. The increased patenting and commercialization activity, however, brings with it concerns over limitation of the right for follow-up research, changes the norms of open-science and constrains open innovation in industry. The ensuing question is: will the increase in patenting activities by GRIs affect the patterns of knowledge transfer from the institute to the upstream, middle-stream and downstream industries? How do the GRIs decide which agricultural innovations are to be made available in the public domain and which are to be patented and made accessible for a fee? This paper first examines the central concerns surrounding open science in GRIs in relation to the output of R &D funded by the Malaysian government. The paper then explores the patent practice of the Malaysian Research Board (MRB) as a case study. MRB is chosen specifically as it is one of the oldest GRIs and the pioneer in patenting in Malaysia. Among the issues that are dealt with in this paper are: how does the Board balance its role in conducting research for the good of the society as opposed to claiming proprietary rights? How does the Board diffuse the R & D results to the small-scale farmers? What are the modes of commercialization adopted by them? The paper ends by suggesting that a balance between open science and patents must be maintained by the MRB in order to move the economy up the value chain.",WOS:000420773500010,WORLD PATENT INFORMATION

In their article in the June 2011 issue of the Journal , Kocjan et al1 raise very important questions about the terminology of thyroid cytopathology. Specifically, a concept has aroused our curiosity: interobserver reproducibility.

The United Kingdom Royal College of Pathologists Classification System (UKRCPCS) for reporting thyroid fine-needle aspiration (FNA) specimens2 undoubtedly represents another step toward standardization, improved clinical significance, and usefulness of thyroid FNA.

During the past decade, several classification schemes for thyroid gland FNA have been proposed by various professional organizations. Most of these schemes consist of 4 to 6 diagnostic categories,3–10 which are not always comparable with each other. This has led to confusion and differences in perceptions of diagnostic terminology in cytopathology reporting of thyroid FNA between cytopathologists and clinicians.11,12 This confusion is even more significant if it is considered that many pathology departments do not use standardized diagnostic categories for the reporting of cytologic diagnoses of thyroid nodular lesions, but rather describe the findings.13 

Among several classification schemes, the 5-class system proposed by the British association, Royal College of Physicians, in 20027 was accepted with some changes by the Italian Society of Pathology and Cytopathology–Italian Section of the International Academy of Pathology (SIAPEC-IAP) in 2007.8 The reporting system in use in the United Kingdom, following publication of a 6-class system, namely, The Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology (TBSRTC),4 was updated by a working group of The Royal College of Pathologists2 and is now quite similar to TBSRTC. Particularly in category Thy1, the use of Thy1c, in which “c” indicates a cystic lesion, was introduced; also in category Thy2, the use of Thy2c, in …",WOS:000303141300022,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PATHOLOGY

METHODS: Twenty-nine participants who ranged in age from 19 to 49 years (mean?±?SD: 23.3?±?5.5 years) were recruited. Osmolarity readings were collected by two operators, in two sessions separated by 1 or 2 weeks in order to assess test reproducibility and repeatability. RESULTS: The coefficient of reproducibility was 39 mOsms/l; the coefficient of repeatability was 33 mOsms/l. CONCLUSIONS: Our mean coefficient of variation over four readings for 29 subjects is 2.9%, which compares well with that reported by the manufacturer. Our results inform practitioners about the level of change over time that can be considered clinically relevant for healthy subjects.

We explored the assumption that the ecosystem services-(ES) concept has the potential to support communication and collaboration between actors in land use planning. If true, the concept could facilitate collaborative planning processes. We analyse how to evolve a planning context in which governance networks at the local landscape level gain importance in decision making, while the central government delegates power. From case studies presented during the symposium we learned that the ES-concept has been explored for application in local land use planning around the world. However, whether ES are recognized as a useful planning concept depends on individual actor preferences and cultural and contextual factors, such as the actual nature-human relationship and gender differences. Also, successful application requires the support of novel assessment, design and visualization tools, which are designed to foster collaboration and social learning. The potential of the concept to contribute to collaborative relationships needs further investigation.","",""

Dynamic loop scheduling (DLS) techniques are an effective approach towards performance improvement of scientific applications via load balancing. These techniques address algorithmic and systemic sources of load imbalance by dynamically assigning tasks to processing elements. The DLS techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness when applied in real applications. Complementing native experiments, simulation is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of parallel and distributed applications. In earlier work, the scalability [1], robustness [2], and resilience [3] of the DLS techniques were investigated using the MSG interface of the SimGrid simulation framework [4]. The present work complements the earlier work and concentrates on the verification via reproducibility of the implementation of the DLS techniques in SimGrid-MSG. This work describes the challenges of verifying the performance of using DLS techniques in earlier implementations of scientific applications. The verification is performed via reproducibility of simulations based on SimGrid-MSG. To simulate experiments selected from earlier literature, the reproduction process begins by extracting the information needed from the earlier literature and converting it into the input required by SimGrid-MSG. The reproducibility study is carried out by comparing the performance of SimGrid-MSG-based experiments with those reported in two selected publications in which the DLS techniques were originally proposed. While the reproduction was not successful for experiments from one of the selected publications, it was successful for experiments from the other. This successful reproduction implies the verification of the DLS implementation in SimGrid-MSG for the considered applications and systems, and thus, it allows well-founded future research on the DLS techniques.","",""

Clinical management is based on individual evaluations and longitudinal trends. The Pediatric Heart Network VVV study (Ventricular Volume Variability) in pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy has reported reproducibility of several of these measures, and how disease state and number of beats impact their reproducibility. In this study, we investigated the impact of observer and sonographer variation on reproducibility of dimension, area, and volume methods to determine the best method for both individual and sequential evaluations. Methods and Results— In 8 centers, echocardiograms were obtained on 169 patients prospectively. During the same visit, 2 different sonographers acquired the same imaging protocol on each patient. Each acquisition was analyzed by 2 different observers; first observer analyzed the first acquisition twice. Intraobserver, interobserver, interacquisition, and interobserver-acquisition (different observers and different acquisition) reproducibility were assessed on measurements of left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, area, and volume. Left ventricular shortening fraction, ejection fraction, mass, and fractional area change were calculated. Percent difference was calculated as (interobservation difference/mean)×100. Interobserver reproducibility for both acquisitions was better for both volume and dimension measurements ( P ≤0.002) compared with area measurements, whereas intraobserver, interacquisition (for both observers), and interobserver-acquisition reproducibilities (for both observer-acquisition sets) were best for volume measurements ( P ≤0.01). Overall, interobserver-acquisition percent differences were significantly higher than interobserver and interacquisition percent differences ( P Conclusions— In pediatric patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, compared with dimension and area methods, left ventricular measurements by volume method have the best reproducibility in settings where assessment is not performed by the same personnel.

We found that overwhelmingly, the interactions previously characterized as problematic instances of conflict are typically better characterized as routine, productive, even collaborative work. These results challenge past work and show the importance of qualitative/quantitative collaboration. In our paper, we present quantitative metrics and qualitative heuristics for operationalizing bot-bot conflict. We give thick descriptions of kinds of events that present as bot-bot reverts, helping distinguish conflict from non-conflict. We computationally classify these kinds of events through patterns in edit summaries. By interpreting found/trace data in the socio-technical contexts in which people give that data meaning, we gain more from quantitative measurements, drawing deeper understandings about the governance of algorithmic systems in Wikipedia.

Methods: Using the CatalystHD Daily Check phantom aligned to the room lasers, both the spatial reproducibility and temporal drift were analyzed in the treatment room with low ambient light (12.65lx)and full light (236.25lx).For temporal drift, measurements were acquired every 5min after cold initialization for 60min without altering the position of the phantom.Prior to the initial measurement, cameras were off for a minimum of 24hours.For spatial reproducibility, a series of 30 sequential measurements were acquired over a 25min period after the system had been on for more than 3 hours without adjusting the Daily Check phantom.For both tests, spatial location of the phantom determined by the CatalystHD system was recorded Results: For temporal drift, total displacement vectors and equilibrium times were calculated for each camera.Displacement vectors were normalized to a value long after equilibrium had been achieved.For the middle camera in low light, ΔX,ΔY,ΔZ,Δ3D were 0.2,0.8,0.1and 0.9 mm, respectively.For full light, ΔX,ΔY,ΔZ,Δ3D were 0.2,1.0,0.1and 1.1 mm, respectively.Both the left and right camera responded similarly.The equilibrium time in low light was 35,45,and 45 minutes for the left, middle and right cameras, respectively, while in full light, they were 30,45,and 40 minutes.For spatial reproducibility in low light, the STD of the recorded locations were 0.04,0.02,0.03mm for the left, middle and right cameras, respectively.For full light, deviations of 0.03,0.02and 0.03 were recorded. Maximum recorded range for any deviation was 0.14mm—below system specification of 0.2mm. Conclusion: A study was performed to assess the spatial reproducibility and temporal drift of the CatalystHD as recommended by TG-147 for nonradiographic imaging systems.An overall warmup time of at least 45 minutes is recommended prior to use.

However, optimal care and restoration of health for a patient are dependent on reliability of diagnosis, therapy, prognosis and prophylaxis. This requires for all tests and procedures a maximal repeatability and reproducibility, a sensitivity and specificity of 85–95% for procedures and methodologies and a comparison of results procedures and methodologies to a gold standard. Looking at the various steps on the road to diagnosis in pathology this is influenced by a series of laboratory steps preparing tissue samples but most importantly reproducibility depends on the handling of visual information in the central nervous system of the individual diagnostician. Thus reproducibility in this context has to be divided into at least three levels: individual (epistemological, organoleptic, inter- and intra-observer variation, and formal/technological- and normative reproducibility). The aim of the present manuscript is to stimulate the reflection among the pathology experts on this most important topic.",WOS:000351320700001,EXPERIMENTAL AND TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY

The Act is similar in scope and objective to the American Bayh-Dole Act. This paper explores some of the problems created or exacerbated by the Bayh-Dole Act and considers lessons that South Africa could learn from the United States’ experience. Traditionally, American innovation was based on a philosophy of open science. Universities conducted basic foundational research which was freely available to others who wanted to commercialise and build on it, or use it for further scientific research. The Bayh-Dole Act changed the model of science to a proprietary model. One of the problems this created was increased patenting of foundational research tools such as genes and cell-lines that follow-on researchers require for their own research. Sometimes, research has been blocked or impeded by an inability to obtain research licences to the patented research on reasonable terms. The Act has also had a negative effect on scientific collaboration and publishing. The paper suggests ways in which South Africa might avoid similar problems when implementing the IPR Act. These include research and experimental use exemptions; compulsory licensing provisions; and open-access patents.","",""

Purpose

Testing of the ventilatory threshold (VT) and maximal oxygen uptake (VO2peak) is relevant for the evaluation of a range of training studies, clinical trials and cross-sectional studies. Due to a possible learning effect, a familiarization test is often performed to increase test reproducibility. However, limited research has investigated this learning effect and reproducibility of maximal exercise testing. The most appropriate ways to determine VT and VO2peak are not clear, and this study evaluated two approaches (V-slope and a combined method) for the determination of VT and five time-averaging intervals (60, 30, 15, 10 and 5 s) for the determination of VO2peak to compare test results and reproducibility.



Methods

Thirteen recreational triathletes completed three identical incremental maximal cycle ergometer tests. The initial workload was 75 and 100 watt (W) for women and men, respectively, and the workload was increased by 4 W/10 s thereafter. No familiarization test was performed.



Results

VO2peak increased significantly as the time-averaging interval became shorter (e.g. 5-s interval 48·7 versus 60-s interval 44·8 ml O2 kg−1 min−1; overall P<0·001). All test results were similar for the three test rounds, indicating that repeated testing was not associated with any learning effect. The different VT measuring methods (CV 7·6 versus 7·7%, P = 0·58) and VO2peak time-averaging intervals (CV 3·7–4·4%, P = 0·99) did not influence test reliability.



Conclusions

The reproducibility of VT and VO2peak was not affected by measuring methods and time-averaging intervals. However, the time-averaging intervals significantly affect the absolute VO2peak values. Furthermore, no learning effect of maximal cycle ergometer testing was observed.",WOS:000395108400012,CLINICAL PHYSIOLOGY AND FUNCTIONAL IMAGING

To investigate whether knowledge of the sequence of radiographs impacts inter- and intraobserver reproducibility and sensitivity to change for measuring joint space width (JSW) in patients with knee osteoarthritis (OA).



Methods

A cohort of 70 postmenopausal women with radiologic knee OA was assessed through the measurement of knee radiographs acquired in the semiflexed posteroanterior view, using a positioning frame and fluoroscopy, at baseline and 48 months later. Paired readings of radiographs were made using landmarks at baseline by 2 independent observers unblinded to sequence and blinded to sequence. Intra- and interobserver reproducibility was assessed on JSW measurements at baseline and 4 years later and on the longitudinal difference (joint space narrowing [JSN]), using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland and Altman methods. The sensitivity to change was assessed through standardized response means (SRMs).



Results

For JSW and JSN and with both methods, ICCs were high for the intra- and interobserver reproducibility (0.90–0.99 for JSW and 0.77–0.89 for JSN). For the Bland-Altman method, the mean difference was close to 0, with no bias for both observers and methods. The SRMs ranged from 0.38 to 0.48. All of the results were numerically in favor of measuring with knowledge of time sequence, but without a statistically significant difference between the methods.



Conclusion

Intra- and interobserver reproducibility was high with or without blinding of the radiograph sequence. Reading with knowledge of time sequence using baseline landmarks tended to improve sensitivity. Therefore, in longitudinal studies of OA radiographs can be read unblinded to sequence.",WOS:000285327000004,ARTHRITIS CARE & RESEARCH

Measurements of knee joint movement in gait analysis may result in large errors caused by misplacement of reflective markers by the testers. To properly understand the measurement results, it is important to guarantee the reliability of the measurement method used for the purpose. The aim of this study was to confirm the interrater reproducibility of a measurement method with a rigid marker set (RMS). Methods. The study subjects were four healthy adults, and the testers were three physical therapists. The interrater reproducibility of the measurements was verified by using the coefficient of multiple correlations (CMCs) and the standard error of measurement (SEM). Results. The average CMCs values of 4 subjects in knee joint movement at the stance phase were greater than 0.8, and the average SEM values of 4 subjects in knee joint movement at the stance phase were also relatively good (maximum error: 2.42°). Conclusion. Based on these results, the measurement method with estimation of anatomical landmarks using the RMS can prevent misplacement during attachment of the reflective markers, as long as the testers have sufficient experience in attaching reflective markers.",WOS:000214760500011,REHABILITATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

This article reviews the evidence for this and considers some of the factors that are responsible and how the problem may be solved. One issue is scientific fraud. This, in turn, may result from pressures put on scientists to succeed including the need to publish in “high impact” journals. I emphasise the importance of judging the quality of the science itself as opposed to using surrogate metrics. The other factors discussed include problems of experimental design and statistical analysis of the work. It is important that these issues are addressed by the scientific community before others impose draconian regulations.","",""

Purpose:  To evaluate the basic characteristics and reproducibility of anterior chamber angle (ACA) measurements determined by anterior-segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in open-angle and primary angle closure suspect (PACS) patients.



Methods:  Thirty-nine open-angle and 18 PACS patients were imaged for ACA by AS-OCT. Subjects underwent imaging of the nasal, temporal and inferior ACA under conditions of constant light, and darkness. For analysis, we used three ACA parameters handled by the Visante OCT software: angle opening distance at 500 μm (AOD500), trabecular-iris space area at 500 μm (TISA500) and angle recess area at 500 μm (ARA500). For determination of inter-session reproducibility, a single well-trained operator (D.Y.K.) scanned all patients at two different visits. For determination of inter-operator variability, a second operator (S.B.P.) acquired another set of images independently. Three sets of images were acquired at least 24 hour apart.



Results:  All parameters were significantly different when measured both in light and darkness, and in the nasal and temporal quadrants. There were no significant differences between the left and right eyes in the three ACA parameters in all quadrants. The temporal angle was wider than the nasal and inferior angles. All parameters of the nasal, temporal angles had excellent inter-session and inter-operator reproducibility [intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) 0.796–0.981], but these values were slightly lower for inferior angle measurements (ICC 0.662–0.892) in both open-angle and PACS groups.



Conclusion:  AS-OCT provides quantitative and reproducible assessment of ACA. Reproducibility was lower in the inferior angle compared with the nasal and temporal angles, perhaps because of variable placement of the scleral spur.",WOS:000292742800028,ACTA OPHTHALMOLOGICA

In order to show that, we adopt a Schumpeterian growth model where the resources allocated to science are endogenously determined within the economy and science is organised according to the institution of “Open Science”. This latter consists in a self-reinforcing code of conduct, which comprises an incentive scheme based on the priority rule, and on the presence of both real rewards and social rewards. Social rewards take two main forms according to the source concerned: one is the social reward deriving from major innovations; another consists in high reputation enjoyed by researchers who put a high level of effort into their job, and devote themselves to the advancement of science. This set of rules causes the emergence of two locally stable steady-states: a low equilibrium, where the economy is endowed with a small science sector; and a high equilibrium, where the economy has a large science sector with rapid knowledge advancement. The two equilibria can account for the huge differences currently existing between scientific sectors of more developed and less developed countries. Comparative static results further characterise the two equilibria, since monetary and social rewards have different effects according to the type of equilibrium that emerges.",WOS:000345807300006,ECONOMIC MODELLING

Study Design  Using 3DTUS, volume data sets were obtained from the nine nulliparous pregnant women by three operators (A, B, and C) in each of the three study sessions. With volume reconstruction, a plane along the inferior edges of bilateral inferior pubic rami was obtained on the axial section. The angle made between the innermost points of both inferior pubic rami at the level of urethra and the inferoposterior point of symphysis pubis was measured as the subpubic arch angle. The intraoperator repeatability of the experienced operator (A) and the interoperator reproducibility between A, B, and C were assessed by the repeatability coefficient and the interoperator intraclass correlation (ICC), respectively. Results  A total of 27 women were examined. The intraoperator repeatability was 4.73 degrees. The overall interoperator ICC was 0.860, and increased from 0.794 in the first session to 0.945 in the third session.

 Sir William Paton's classical exploitation of nitrogen in mixtures of gases for deep-sea diving is a good example of what would now be called “blue skies” research where the data obtained were used as the basis for subsequent hypothesis-driven work. Like his work on acetyl choline, the original observations were the basis for further painstaking and step-like progression by experimentation, where each I was dotted and T crossed as the establishment of a therapy or practice was built into a clinical framework or workplace. However, in recent times there has been a failure to follow a similar cautious and pragmatic practice of advancement of knowledge at the interface of Science and Policy. Inadequately investigated associations are made the basis of speculative therapeutic or dietary interventions in frameworks where lack of effect is often not demonstrable and where the possibility of harm is seldom considered, notably in the dietary field. In the same way, isolated findings in regulatory studies may lead to poor decision making or to extensive work to explain non-significant events. The Economist has pointed out that venture capitalists use the rule that only 50% of academic study results can be replicated and Begley and Ellis report that a study of 53 “landmark” papers in Oncology found that only 6 were reproducible even with co-operation of the original authors. So what notice should be taken of single adverse toxicological studies in animals? Of isolated, epidemiologically determined associations? What is the scientific value of an individual regulatory study? What is the probability of error? What is the role of chance and variation? Only an understanding of mechanisms of production of the effect in question can resolve these issues.","",""

While industry's involvement in academic research is growing, various scholars have warned that this trend might corrupt open science by fostering secrecy in academia, and by leading scientists toward less publishable lines of work. In this study, we argue that, under certain circumstances, academia-industry collaboration can sharpen the particularities of the academic institutional environment rather than corrupt it. We propose that in research lines with both high scientific and commercial potential, scientists in industry and academia might be able to draw on the distinctive capabilities of their respective institutional environments, therefore leading to an increase in academic productivity within the collaborative line of research. An empirical challenge is that research projects that involve industry collaborators may be qualitatively different from those that do not. To address this issue, we exploit the occurrence of simultaneous discoveries where multiple scientists make roughly the same discovery around the same time. Following a simultaneous discovery, we compare the subsequent research trajectories of academic scientists who collaborated with industry on the discovery to academic scientists who did not. Counter to the argument that industry collaboration corrupts academic institutional norms, we find that academic scientists who collaborated with industry produce more publications and fewer patents on their collaborative research lines than their academic peers who did not collaborate with industry. We show that these effects are particularly salient when the industry partner is an established company, rather than a startup.","",""

The transcripts of those lectures were published as a book entitled Crisis in Communication: The Functions and Future of Medical Journals two years later. In the book, Fox makes a stark prediction: “A day will come when journals will be superseded as a means of publishing new research.” (FOX, 1965). As the fiftieth anniversary of the book’s publication draws near, it is worth reassessing Fox’s prediction. Will journals be superseded 50 years from now? At first glance that seems unlikely. The first scientific journal, Philosophical Transactions, was published in 1665. Three centuries later, when Fox wrote Crisis in Communication, there were 6,000 medical journals in existence. Now, Scopus, one of the largest indexes of scholarly output, includes around 21,000 journals in its database: it has indexed 21 million articles published between 1823 and 1996, and a further 33 million records published within the last two decades. Indeed, according to a recent analysis, scientific output continues to increase by around 8-9% per year (BORNMANN; MUTZ, 2014). This increase in the number of articles is often at the expense of quality, with many papers never being cited. According to one estimate, as many as 12% of papers in the clinical sciences, and 27% of papers in the life sciences, are not cited within 5 years of publication (REMLER, 2014). The drivers for this are clear — academics feel pressured to publish as many papers as possible in order to get tenure and to secure new research funding. Furthermore, the huge volumes of papers being published also puts pressure on the academic community in other ways: readers are struggling to keep up with the literature; and many journals are finding it increasingly hard to secure the services of qualified peer reviewers to judge the suitability of papers for publication. The process of doing science is also changing. Not so long ago, single-author papers were considered to be essential for career advancement, as they demonstrated the ability to do research independently. More recently, large-scale collaborations are the order of the day, with hundreds, sometimes thousands, of researchers collaborating on expensive, international scientific studies. Jim Gray, a computer scientist, identified this shift in the scientific method calling it ‘the fourth paradigm’. In his words (GRAY, 2007, p. xix): The world of science has changed, and there is no question about this. The new model is for the data to be captured by instruments or generated by simulations before being processed by software and for the resulting information or knowledge to be stored in computers. Scientists only get to look at their data fairly late in this pipeline. The techniques and technologies for such data-intensive science are so different that it is worth distinguishing data-intensive science from computational science as a new, fourth paradigm for scientific exploration. Even small-scale studies often generate large amounts of data, and making these data discoverable and reusable is becoming an increasingly important priority for the scientific community. The rise of the open science movement, in which both the raw data and final publication are made available for easy access and reuse, has opened up opportunities for scientific-data-hosting companies like Figshare and Dryad, as well as for open-access ‘mega-journals’ like PLoS One and Scientific Reports. However, open-access journals, which generate revenue by charging authors an ‘article processing charge’ (APC) to publish their paper, have the potential to make the problem worse, not better, by making it easier for authors to publish their work. Fox considered journal publishing to be in crisis 50 years ago, but the crisis in communication is arguably far worse now than it was then (FOX, 1965). Funders and academic institutions need to address the current crisis in two ways. First, they need to reward scientists for the quality, not quantity, of the work that they publish; surrogate markers of quality, such as journal impact factors, are widely perceived to be imperfect ways of judging an individual scientist’s research output and new metrics are urgently needed. Second, funders and institutions should encourage their researchers to publish much of their work in repositories. These standardized reports would not necessarily be read by human beings, but rather would hold data and data descriptors in a form that is machine-readable to allow accurate indexing and meta-analysis by computers. There are early signs that such an approach would be feasible, but it will take time to change 350 years of academic culture. How long, exactly, remains to be seen.

A particular focus of this study was the manner in which these students merge the world of school science with their social world to create a hybrid space by appropriating knowledge and resources of the school and home. Within this hybrid space they experienced a deeper, more meaningful and authentic engagement in science practical work. This hybrid space redefined the landscape of the science learning experience for these students, as they could derive the twofold benefit of appropriating support when necessary and at the same time maintain their autonomy over the investigation. For South Africa and quite probably other countries; these findings serve as a guideline as to how opportunities can be created for students to do open science investigations, against prevailing school factors such as large classes, a lack of physical resources, the lack of time for practical work and the demands of syllabus coverage.",WOS:000314027800006,RESEARCH IN SCIENCE EDUCATION

The burgeoning field of neuroscience is at an important nexus of discovery. The pace of innovation is accelerating along with increased curiosity about how the most mysterious organ of the body works. Emerging technologies, such as optogenetics, permit an inquiry into brain function at unprecedented levels of detail and sophistication. Large-scale collaborations and Open Science frameworks make neural data available to more researchers, thereby expanding and democratizing the scientific process. These efforts generate big data sets, spanning multiple methodologies that benefit from machine learning and other analytic tools to elucidate brain-behavior relationships.

Traditionally, the dissemination of knowledge derived from clinical research has been limited in scope: Investigators who have designed and conducted clinical trials make the decisions about which statistical analyses to conduct and then publish peer-reviewed articles to disseminate their findings. Clinical trial data are considered the property of the investigators and the entities that sponsored the research, with little or no opportunity for investigators external to the original study team to access the data. This traditional model is based on dissemination via print publication, the origins of which date back to the 17th century.

By continued adherence to this model in the age of electronic knowledge exchange, our understanding of clinical interventions is limited by our lack of access to comprehensive data from all clinical trials in several ways. First, a select number of individuals decide which analyses to conduct, choosing some at the exclusion of others, while an analysis that might have been of great interest to another investigator (and which may have a direct bearing on clinical practice) may not be performed. Second, among these findings generated, a select number might be included in any peer-reviewed publication, leaving the research community and clinicians at a loss to know about findings generated but not disseminated. In fact, by comparing published articles with trial protocols, 50% of efficacy and 65% of harm outcomes per trial have been shown to be incompletely reported and biased toward the reporting of statistically significant findings.1 Third, among all trials conducted, there may be significant publication delays, as happened with the Ezetimibe and Simvastatin in Hypercholesterolemia …",WOS:000302120300019,CIRCULATION-CARDIOVASCULAR QUALITY AND OUTCOMES

To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of quantitative analysis of the morphological corneal changes after orthokeratology treatment using “Image-Pro Plus 6.0” software (IPP). Methods. Three sets of measurements were obtained: two sets by examiner 1 with 5 days apart and one set by examiner 2 on the same day. Parameters of the eccentric distance, eccentric angle, area, and roundness of the corneal treatment zone were measured using IPP. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and repetitive coefficient (COR) were used to calculate the repeatability and reproducibility of these three sets of measurements. Results. ICC analysis suggested “excellent” reliability of more than 0.885 for all variables, and COR values were less than 10% for all variables within the same examiner. ICC analysis suggested “excellent” reliability for all variables of more than 0.90, and COR values were less than 10% for all variables between different examiners. All extreme values of the eccentric distance and area of the treatment zone pointed to the same material number in three sets of measurements. Conclusions. IPP could be used to acquire the exact data of the characteristic morphological corneal changes after orthokeratology treatment with good repeatability and reproducibility.

Open Research Infrastructures and the role of repositories,0,"Watch the VIDEO of the presentation. The Way to Open Science contains many  components. One of these  components would be open repositories based on open source software  with free access to researchers. Open access policies are essential, as are open infrastructures and open contents. Repositories can support this openness by offering open licenses, open metadata , the possibility to use open formats  and open thesauri.  Another principal point is transparency. Open peer review should be possible, and the description of processes should also be transparent. Of course, an open license should provide all data types and metadata as well. It is important to help researchers to make their results visible and accessible and to encourage them to publish in OA-Journals and use repositories for the underlying data. Open Access Policies are supporting these efforts. Open data can be freely used, modified, and shared by anyone for any purpose. In order to do so, Open Licenses are required. Also Metadata are important components of the Way  to Open Science. Metadata are data about data which should be free of all restrictions on access, structured and based on standards. Open formats are defined by a published specification and are not restricted in their use. They are mainly used by open-source software. Open Thesauruses are freely accessible for everyone without costs and with a free license. Open Processes should be documented, transparent, repeatable and reusable. An open peer review process is also  a step  forward to Open Science. Authors and referees are no longer anonymous. The whole process and the decision letters are open. Of course Open licenses allow the reuse of any work or data without any restrictions. The lecture will deal with various aspects of open science and focus on the role of repositories – with all chances and challenges.","",""

The reproducibility of a questionnaire on melanoma risk factors was investigated using a test-retest approach in 389 Dutch melanoma patients. In 2011, 389 melanoma patients filled out a questionnaire on melanoma risk factors twice. Test-retest reproducibility was assessed by calculating kappas (kappa), weighted kappas (kappaw), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for categorical, ordinal, and continuous variables, respectively. Stratified analyses were carried out by sex, age group, education level, and time since diagnosis. The median time between the questionnaires was 31 days. The reproducibility was substantial for questions on phenotypic characteristics (kappa/kappaw/ICC=0.62-0.77), fair-to-substantial for sun exposure and sun protection behavior (kappa/kappaw/ICC=0.38-0.79), and moderate for sunburn history (kappa/kappaw=0.42-0.51). No clear differences were observed between men and women. Younger patients showed a better reproducibility in nine of the 29 questions compared with older patients and higher educated patients showed a better reproducibility in four of the 29 questions. Patients with a diagnosis shorter than 1.5 years ago had a better reproducibility in four out of 29 items compared with patients with a diagnosis 1.5-3.0 years ago. Our study showed that self-reported information on melanoma risk factors is fairly well reproducible. Although this does not guarantee validity, this type of questionnaire seems to be useful in research settings. The reproducibility is slightly better in young patients and patients with a higher education level, which can be taken into account when interpreting results from epidemiological studies.",WOS:000344919500008,MELANOMA RESEARCH

The purpose of this study was to investigate the reproducibility of virtual organ computer-aided analysis II software (GE Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI), an integrated tool for 3-dimensional power Doppler angiography (3D-PDA), in measuring vascularization of cervical carcinoma under manual and automatic sphere contour modes. Methods. Eighty patients with cervical carcinoma were prospectively examined by observer 1 using transvaginal 3D-PDA. For each patient, measurements of the vascularization index, flow index, and vascularization-flow index were repeated twice under both manual and automatic sphere contour modes. Forty patients were randomly selected for another round of examination by observer 2 under the same setting. The reproducibility of vascularization measurements was assessed by the intraclass correlation coefficient (intra-CC), interclass correlation coefficient (interCC), and 95% limits of agreement (LOAs). Various analysis of variance models were used to estimate the contribution of each factor (observer, contour mode, and patient) to measurement variance. Results. For each observer, the manual contour mode outperformed the automatic sphere contour mode in reproducibility (intra-CC, 0.96 to 0.99 versus 0.77 to 0.94). In addition, repeated measurements of the manual mode had a smaller SD and a narrower LOA. For the manual contour mode, interobserver agreement was comparable with intraobserver agreement (inter-CC, 0.91 to 0.98, versus intra-CC, 0.96 to 0.99). However, the interobserver agreement was significantly smaller than the intraobserver agreement for the automatic sphere contour mode (inter-CC, 0.51 to 0.85, versus intra-CC, 0.77 to 0.94; P= .001). Conclusions. The manual contour mode for 3D-PDA vascular measurements has better interobserver and intraobserver reproducibility than the automatic sphere contour mode.

In the three years since the launch of Genome Medicine, we have seen discussion panels at genomics conferences tackling such topics as return of research results to participants and physician education in the genomic era, while headlines have been made by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act [1], the Myriad Genetics patent litigation [2], and the US Food and Drug Administration's take on direct-to-consumer testing[3].

Considerations of the ethical implications of genomic technologies and data are crucial to the implementation of genomic advances for improving human health. Work in the ethical, legal and social issues (ELSI) field does not always fit the standard Research article format, but broad, transparent access to these analyses and discussions is essential if they are to be integrated into the field of genomic medicine. In this issue of the journal, we introduce a peer-reviewed open-access article type, Open Debate, to accommodate novel and scholarly arguments that are informed by analysis and discussion, not just practical research. In the first article of this new type, Timothy Caulfield, Shawn Harmon and Yann Joly investigate the conflicts between open science and commercialization in genomics research [4].

Genomics has a culture of open data dating to before the time of the Human Genome Project, with the principles of accessibility formalized in the Bermuda agreement leading to an ongoing general principle that sequencing data should be released into the public domain as soon as possible after they are generated, and at least prior to publication. In the burgeoning field of medical sequencing, this principle has been tempered somewhat by considerations of patient privacy (a topic for another day), but as a rule, openness in genomics research continues to be both integral and essential. For example, it is hard to imagine how the recent explosion of genome-wide association studies, with their huge sample sizes, could have taken place without collaboration and data sharing. However, researchers are also increasingly encouraged to commercialize their research to speed product development and for monetary gain, which implies secrecy and competition. In their article, Caulfield and colleagues carry out an exploratory analysis of these two aspects of the policy guidelines from major funding bodies in the UK, US and Canada, concluding that these two opposing forces in genomics research may not be irreconcilable, but that a flexible middle way must be sought.

In the spirit of openness and fostering debate, we encourage our readers to use the Comments facility available on our website, or tweet @genomemedicine, to join in the discussion. The transition to genomic medicine is dependent upon the participation of researchers, ethicists, lawyers, clinicians and patients, and we'd like to hear your views.",WOS:000314566800002,GENOME MEDICINE

Every lab was required to run the samples in triplicate; thus, the observed relative standard deviation of repeatability (RSDr) values for most of the samples were <1, which indicates the mill results are very repeatable.

The blend of the technology components and grassroots culture is necessary for governments to function as a platform. Yet, open data can achieve more than transparency and GaaP services. By leveraging open data and applying the principles of open access and open science, governments can collaborate with external researchers to implement analytic, stochastic research models that improve the efficiency of city operations and help advise on data-driven policy. Governments can leverage technologies such as open source software and distributed version control to share research with others, inviting review through reproducible research and also inviting improvements.

To develop a nutritional screening tool and examine its reliability and validity in elementary school children with malnutrition based on PRECEDE–PROCEED model, in Shiraz, Iran.

Methods
A questionnaire was designed and its reproducibility was analysed via test–retest design among students with malnutrition. The students were in the fourth to sixth grades. Validity was assessed using face validity, content validity, construct validity, item difficulty and item discrimination. Reliability was measured by Cronbach's alpha (internal consistency), the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and κ statistics (test–retest reliability).

Results
A total of 165 primary school students (mean age of 11.21 ± 1.08 years, 65.5% females) participated in the study. The PRECEDE–PROCEED theoretical model for health education was adapted for this questionnaire. The questionnaire was divided into four main sections: predisposing, reinforcing, enabling factors and behaviour. Coefficient α reliability estimate was above 0.9 for most scales. The ICCs for different scales of the questionnaire were within the range of 0.402–0.800. Values for κ ranged from 0.412 to 0.785 for most scales.

Conclusions
The results showed reasonable validity, excellent reliability and moderate to substantial reproducibility for all scales of the questionnaire except two questions for κ statistics. The present study is of great importance, as there are no psychometrically evaluated tools (based on health behaviour models) with accepted validity and reliability for the evaluation of such factors in children with malnutrition. The questionnaire developed in the present study can be used to assess the effect of intervention among primary school students with malnutrition.",WOS:000414992300014,NUTRITION & DIETETICS

We use these case studies to identify implicit and explicit assumptions present in each of the workflow implementations and then propose a comprehensive breakdown of reproducibility requirements that can inform a more structured, assumption-free approach to implementing highly reproducible genomic analyses.","",""

Methods : Electronic databases (Pubmed, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched for papers published from 1998 to October 2014. Specific strategies were developed for each database, with the guidance of a librarian. Two reviewers independently analyzed the titles and abstracts for inclusion. The articles that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for full-text reading, and the selected articles went through methodological quality evaluation. After the exclusion of repeated articles, the titles of the remaining ones were read and 1,328 of them were excluded. The abstracts of 173 articles were read, of which 43 were selected, read in full and submitted to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Fourteen articles or studies with reliable methodology and reproducibility remained. The data were collected, organized into figures and analyzed for determination of the reliability and reproducibility of the three-dimensional cephalometric landmarks. Results : Overall, the landmarks on the median sagittal line and dental landmarks had the highest reliability, while the landmarks on the condyle, porion and the orbitale presented lower levels of reliability. Point S must be marked in the multiplanar views associated with visualization in 3D reconstruction.

For each workout, our methods entailed the performance of 3-6 front squat repetitions per set at 55, 65, and 75% of subject's 1 repetition maximum (1RM) load. In addition, a fourth set was done at a heavier load, with a resistance equal to 80 and 83% of their 1RM values, for the first and second workouts, respectively. A triple-axis accelerometer was affixed to a barbell to quantify exercise performance. Per load, the accelerometer measures peak values for the following indices: force, velocity, and power. To assess data reproducibility, inter-workout comparisons were made for 12 performance indices with 4 statistical test-retest measures: intraclass correlation coefficients, coefficients of variation (CVs), and the SEM expressed in both absolute and relative terms. Current results show that the majority of performance indices exceeded intraclass correlation (0.75-0.80) and CV (10-15%) values previously deemed as acceptable levels of data reproducibility. The 2 indices with the greatest variability were power and velocity values obtained at 55% of the 1RM load; thus, it was concluded that higher movement rates at the lightest load were the most difficult aspect of front squat performance to repeat successfully over time. Our practical applications imply lighter loads, with inherently higher rates of barbell movement, yield lower data reproducibility values.",WOS:000298860300006,JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH

Materials and Methods: A total of 10 healthy volunteers were included in this study. After marking of facial anatomy points, their faces were scanned by a structured light scanning system and a stereophotogrammetry system, and three-dimensional (3D) images were reconstructed with corresponding software. For each volunteer, scanning was performed twice after calibration. Linear measurements were calculated and compared for the two scanning techniques with direct caliper measurements. Absolute errors (AE), absolute percentage errors (APE), and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were chosen as indices to determine the accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility of the two systems. 
Results: There was no statistically significant difference among the three measuring techniques (.891 < P < .999). Both scanning systems demonstrated high accuracy (AE = 0.58 ± 0.37 mm and APE = 1.11 ± 0.73% for the structured light system; AE = 0.62 ± 0.39 mm and APE 1.17 ± 0.71% for the stereophotogrammetry system). The two systems demonstrated extremely high reliability compared to caliper measurement (0.982 < ICC < 0.998 for the structured light system; 0.984 < ICC < 0.999 for the stereophotogrammetry system). In addition, high reproducibility was observed with the two systems (0.981 < ICC < 0.999 for the structured light system; 0.984 < ICC < 1.000 for the stereophotogrammetry system). 
Conclusion: When applied in scanning and measuring human faces, the structured light scanning system and stereophotogrammetry scanning system both demonstrated high accuracy, reliability, and reproducibility.",WOS:000376213500003,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTICS

For scientific software, however, this is less often the case. Most scientific software is written by only a few authors, often a student working on a thesis. Once the paper describing the tool has been published, the tool is no longer developed further and is left to its own device. Here we describe the broad, multidisciplinary community we formed around a set of tools for statistical genomics. The GenABEL project for statistical omics actively promotes open interdisciplinary development of statistical methodology and its implementation in efficient and user-friendly software under an open source licence. The software tools developed withing the project collectively make up the GenABEL suite, which currently consists of eleven tools. The open framework of the project actively encourages involvement of the community in all stages, from formulation of methodological ideas to application of software to specific data sets. A web forum is used to channel user questions and discussions, further promoting the use of the GenABEL suite. Developer discussions take place on a dedicated mailing list, and development is further supported by robust development practices including use of public version control, code review and continuous integration. Use of this open science model attracts contributions from users and developers outside the “core team”, facilitating agile statistical omics methodology development and fast dissemination.","",""

Some accomplishments of these initiatives are noted, but this article focuses on why they do not provide a general solution for what ails psychology. There are inherent limitations to mass replications ever being conducted in many areas of psychology, both in terms of their practicality and their prospects for improving the science. Unnecessary compromises were built into the ground rules for design and publication of the Open Science Collaboration: Psychology that undermine its effectiveness. Some ground rules could actually be flipped into guidance for how not to conduct replications. Greater adherence to best publication practices, transparency in the design and publishing of research, strengthening of independent post-publication peer review and firmer enforcement of rules about data sharing and declarations of conflict of interest would make many replications unnecessary. Yet, it has been difficult to move beyond simple endorsement of these measures to consistent implementation. Given the strong institutional support for questionable publication practices, progress will depend on effective individual and collective use of social media to expose lapses and demand reform. Some recent incidents highlight the necessity of this.","",""

Our findings reveal that the extent of the connectedness among scientists and inventors is rather large, and that particular individuals, i.e. authors-inventors, who act as gatekeepers and bridge the boundaries between the two domains, are fundamental to ensuring this connectivity. These individuals tend to occupy prominent positions in the scientific and the technological networks. However, our results also show maintaining a very central position in the scientific network may come at the expense of being able to fill a similarly central position in a technological network (and vice versa).

The enhanced Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample (NKI-RS) is a response to this need.

However, comparing their effectiveness is a challenging task because evaluation results are rarely reproducible. In this article, we examine the challenge of reproducibility in recommender-system research. We conduct experiments using Plista's news recommender system, and Docear's research-paper recommender system. The experiments show that there are large discrepancies in the effectiveness of identical recommendation approaches in only slightly different scenarios, as well as large discrepancies for slightly different approaches in identical scenarios. For example, in one news-recommendation scenario, the performance of a content-based filtering approach was twice as high as the second-best approach, while in another scenario the same content-based filtering approach was the worst performing approach. We found several determinants that may contribute to the large discrepancies observed in recommendation effectiveness. Determinants we examined include user characteristics (gender and age), datasets, weighting schemes, the time at which recommendations were shown, and user-model size. Some of the determinants have interdependencies. For instance, the optimal size of an algorithms' user model depended on users' age. Since minor variations in approaches and scenarios can lead to significant changes in a recommendation approach's performance, ensuring reproducibility of experimental results is difficult. We discuss these findings and conclude that to ensure reproducibility, the recommender-system community needs to (1) survey other research fields and learn from them, (2) find a common understanding of reproducibility, (3) identify and understand the determinants that affect reproducibility, (4) conduct more comprehensive experiments, (5) modernize publication practices, (6) foster the development and use of recommendation frameworks, and (7) establish best-practice guidelines for recommender-systems research.",WOS:000373021900003,USER MODELING AND USER-ADAPTED INTERACTION

We pay particular attention to the methods that were employed to uniquify the namespaces for the data, derive metadata for the over 460,000 image series taken by the COUP experiment and what was required to map that information into coherent datasets that could be stored and retrieved using the large scale archives systems.We describe the data transfer and cataloging engines that are used for data importation and how these engines have been setup to import data from the data acquisition systems of ongoing experiments at non-Fermilab remote sites including the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso and the Ash River Laboratory in Orr, Minnesota.

To evaluate the reproducibility of presurgical functional MRI (fMRI) language mapping based on test–retest scans, comparing traditional activation t-maps to relative activation maps normalized by activation mapping as percentage of local excitation (AMPLE).



Materials and Methods:

Language fMRI scans were performed by 12 healthy volunteer subjects undergoing a standard clinical presurgical mapping protocol in multiple independent scan sessions. Objective relative AMPLE activation maps were generated automatically by normalizing statistical t-value maps to the local peak activation amplitude within each functional brain region. The spatial distribution of activation was quantified and compared across mapping algorithms, subjects, scanners, and pulse sequences.



Results:

The spatial distribution of traditional blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) t-value statistical activation maps was highly variable in test–retest scans of single subjects, whereas AMPLE normalized maps were highly reproducible in terms of the location, hemispheric laterality, and spatial extent of relative activation. AMPLE map reproducibility was good regardless of scanner, field strength, or pulse sequence used, but reproducibility was best for scans acquired on the same scanner using the same pulse sequence.



Conclusion:

Reproducibility of the spatial pattern of BOLD activation makes relative amplitude fMRI mapping a useful normalization tool for clinical imaging of language function, where reproducibility and quantitative measurements are critical concerns.

This interest stems not only from cost savings, but also from benefits concerning reproducibility and collaboration. Technical challenges hamper practical reproducibility, especially when multiple software packages are required to conduct an analysis. In this study, we use containerization to package a GEOBIA workflow in a well-defined FOSS environment. We explore the approach using two software stacks to perform an exemplary analysis detecting destruction of buildings in bi-temporal images of a conflict area. The analysis combines feature extraction techniques with segmentation and object-based analysis to detect changes using automatically-defined local reference values and to distinguish disappeared buildings from non-target structures. The resulting workflow is published as FOSS comprising both the model and data in a ready to use Docker image and a user interface for interaction with the containerized workflow. The presented solution advances GEOBIA in the following aspects: higher transparency of methodology; easier reuse and adaption of workflows; better transferability between operating systems; complete description of the software environment; and easy application of workflows by image analysis experts and non-experts. As a result, it promotes not only the reproducibility of GEOBIA, but also its practical adoption.",WOS:000398720100104,REMOTE SENSING

In order to reproduce the results of an experiment, on one hand provenance information must be collected and on the other hand the dependencies of the execution need to be eliminated. Concerning the workflow execution environment we have differentiated four levels of provenance: infrastructural, environmental, workflow and data provenance. During the re-execution at all levels the components can change and capturing the data of each levels targets different problems to solve. For example storing the environmental and infrastructural parameters enables the portability of workflows between the different parallel and distributed systems (grid, HPC, cloud). The describers of the workflow model enable tracking the different versions of the workflow and their impacts on the execution. Our goal is to capture the most optimal parameters in number and type as well and reconstruct the way of data production independently from the environment. In this paper we investigate the necessary and satisfactory parameters of workflow reproducibility and give a mathematical formula to determine the rate of reproducibility. These measurements allow the scientist to make a decision about the next steps toward the creation of reproducible workflows.","",""

Over the last two decades 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT, has been used to discriminate neurodegenerative Parkinsonian syndrome from other diseases. BasGan is a freely available software that assists 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT evaluation by estimating semiquantitative values for each basal nucleus and compares the results to a database of healthy subjects. The aims of this study were: (1) to assess the accuracy of qualitative analysis and of semiquantitative, BasGan-assisted evaluations of 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT; (2) to compare the accuracy of both methods when applied to “doubtful” cases; (3) to appreciate the reproducibility of the BasGan-assisted evaluations.



MATERIALS AND METHODS

Seventy-eight patients were included in this 4-year follow-up study. The diagnostic cut-off for semiquantitative uptake values of each basal nucleus was determined based on ROC curves analysis. Accuracy scores were calculated for the entire population and for “doubtful” cases. Intra- and interoperator reproducibility was assessed.



RESULTS

Accuracy of the software-assisted analyses was high for data from each nucleus. In “doubtful” exams accuracy was higher when using BasGan as opposed to relying solely on visual assessment. Intra- and interoperator reproducibility of the BasGan-assisted evaluations was good to excellent.



CONCLUSION

BasGan-assisted evaluations of 123I-FP-CIT-SPECT were very useful, particularly in “doubtful” cases. Multicenter studies are mandatory before routine use of BasGan.",WOS:000335027500008,JOURNAL OF NEUROIMAGING

The ability of the whole measurement system (the process and the gauge together) is characterized by two key probabilities: the probability of a rejected part being good and the probability of an accepted part being bad. These probabilities can be calculated either with the proposed mathematical model of GPC (GPC-method) or by using relative frequencies (AIAG-type method). The performance of the two approaches has been compared, and the proposed GPC-method is proven to be statistically favourable.

Methods Twenty orthodontic dental casts of permanent dentitions were selected. Three-dimensional images were obtained on this scanner and analyzed by using the Geomagic Studio 5 software (Raindrop Geomagic, Inc, Morrisville, NC). Measurements were made with a digital caliper directly on the dental casts and also digitally on the digital models. Fifteen anatomic dental points were identified, and a total of 11 linear measurements were taken from each cast, including arch length and width. Dependent t tests were used to evaluate intraexaminer reproducibility and measurement accuracy on the digital models. Results No statistically significant differences were found between the measurements made directly on the dental casts and on the digital models. Conclusions Linear measurements on digital models are accurate and reproducible.

We read with great interest the paper by Afolabi et al. [1]. It is true that 13C-liver function breath tests (13C-LFBTs) appear to be attractive both to patients and physicians because of their non-invasive protocol, as opposed to diagnostic procedures infringing the body integrity, which inherently entails a liver biopsy. Unfortunately, after almost three decades during which 13C-LFBTs were available to clinicians, those tests still have not paved their way to become a routine diagnostic tool. The breakthrough made by the quoted paper consists in the clear delineation of targets for future research which, if attained, should gain an objective view upon the clinical usefulness of those tests. Accordingly, phase one of this validation process should involve evaluation of reproducibility, the second one involves the assessment of prognostic utility, and ultimately the third phase should investigate the effect of 13C-LFBTs upon the patients’ outcome [1].

One should be aware that the result of a breath test, like in the case of any other quantitative diagnostic method applied in medicine, may contain a certain degree of inexactitude because an immanent feature of any measurement is its proneness to random as well as systematic errors. Therefore it is necessary to identify possible sources of measurement errors and to estimate of their contribution to the overall error of a diagnostic method and, as the ultimate step, to undertake means to possibly minimize it.

In the case of 13C breath tests, the total measurement error will be accounted for by the precision and exactitude of the apparatus used to determine the content of 13CO2 within samples of the expired air, degree of conformity with the recommended protocol of accomplishing the test, and inherent biological variability of the living organism undergoing a diagnostic procedure.

The error introduced by the measurement equipment is relatively easy to estimate, because it will be characterized by sensitivity, linearity range, as well as by within- and between-series consistency of measurement results. Those items are basically addressed by manufacturers, and a daily routine of calibration assures the maintenance of optimum performance of the equipment. Knowledge of the performance of the measuring system is of course necessary to adjust an optimum dosage of the 13C-labeled substrate applied for a given breath test [2].

Minimization of the error associated with the implementation of a breath test is achieved by standardization of the composition and method of preparing a test meal, the time allowed for its consumption, number, time intervals and the method of sampling the expiratory air, as well as the ambiance offered to the examined subjects while undergoing the examination. The set of interventions usually undertaken in this respect comprises advice and recommendations given to subjects with regard to some restrictions that have to be observed before an examination (like remaining fasting, abstaining from smoking cigarettes, withdrawal of use of medication), and the behavior during the test (avoidance of physical activity, maintenance of a recommended body position, refraining from smoking and from taking meals or drinks other than that provided by the laboratory staff) [3–6].

Measures undertaken in an attempt to control the error introduced by biological variability may consist in a strict observation of a constant time of day when the test is performed, or, in the case of women at a reproductive age—in taking into account their menstrual cycle status [7, 8].

We totally agree with Afolabi et al. [1] that a valuable tool enabling the assessment of the performance of a quantitative measurement in medicine is the determination of the reproducibility of the results it provides. An estimation of the gross error of the diagnostic method, accounted for by the factors and circumstances described above, can be thus obtained. Consequently, a poor reproducibility of a test will in fact determine its unsuitability for clinical applications, since it means that the results of tests performed in the same person under identical conditions may largely differ from one another [9].

It is our pleasure to provide herein additional data on reproducibility of the 13C-LFBTs, not reported in the paper by Afolabi et al. [1]. In our laboratory we pursued prospective evaluation of the reproducibility of the 13C-methacetin breath test (13C-Meth-BT) [10], the 13C-alpha-ketoisokaproic acid breath test (13C-KICA-BT) [11], and the 13C-phenylalanine breath test (13C-PhenAla-BT) [12]. Thus, insight on the precision of the representatives of three main groups of the 13C-LFBTs has been obtained, since the 13C-Meth-BT evaluates the microsomal liver metabolism, whereas the 13C-KICA-BT and the 13C-PhenAla-BT are dedicated to assess the mitochondrial and the cytosolic metabolic efficiency of the liver, respectively. The results of the short-term (repeat examination were taken 1–3 days apart) and the medium-term (the repeat measurements were separated by a 2–3-week break) reproducibility of the three 13C-LFBTs are assembled in Table 1. The common denominator of those data is that Tmax—the time to reach the peak of 13CO2 concentration in expiratory air—is considerably less reproducible than the two other quantitative parameters of the 13C-LFBTs, namely, the maximum momentary elimination (Dmax) which is characterized by a fair reproducibility, and the best reproducible cumulative elimination of 13C in breath air, conveyed as the area under the 13C elimination curve (AUC). In no instance did the medium-term reproducibility prove any worse than the short-term one (Table 1). Quite strikingly, taking into account the magnitude of the pertinent coefficients of variation for paired examinations (CVp), the reproducibility of the 13C-PhenAla-BT appears to be remarkably worse than in the case of either the 13C-Meth-BT or 13C-KICA-BT. The latter finding raises concerns whether the precision of the 13C-PhenAla-BT may be sufficient to yield clinically sound conclusions.



Table 1

Reproducibility of three liver breath tests



Detailed analyses of the reproducibility data referred in this correspondence have been published elsewhere [10, 11]. In summary, we would like to recall some important observations. First, in the case of 13C-Meth-BT it was found that on repeat examinations the exactitude of AUC may be modestly affected by a persistent stimulation of CYP1A2 responsible for a fixed bias which amounted to 8 % [10]. Second, achievement of a necessary reproducibility level of the 13C-KICA-BT requires calculation of the AUC for a time span from within the range between 0 and 90 min or even better, for 0–120 min [11].

We do hope that the data and remarks contained herein supplement and support the idea of systematic validation of 13C-LFBTs outlined in the paper by Afolabi et al. [1].",WOS:000315291100040,DIGESTIVE DISEASES AND SCIENCES

The availability of raw data is actually regarded as a fundamental way to advance science by promoting both integrity and reproducibility of research outcomes. Particularly, in the field of natural product and chemical research, NMR spectroscopy is a fundamental tool for structural elucidation and quantification (qNMR). As such, the accessibility of original NMR data, i.e., Free Induction Decays (FIDs), fosters transparency in chemical research and optimizes both peer review and reproducibility of reports by offering the fundamental tools to perform efficient structural verification. Although original NMR data are known to contain a wealth of information, they are rarely accessible along with published data. This viewpoint discusses the relevance of the availability of original NMR data as part of good research practices not only to promote structural correctness, but also to enhance traceability and reproducibility of both chemical and biological results.",WOS:000382048100001,NATURAL PRODUCT REPORTS

For many governmental public health agencies, funding and staffing resources remain below their prerecession levels and show little sign of a bounce-back, indicating a new normal of seeking efficiencies in public health protections. At the same time, health insurance coverage expansions under the Affordable Care Act are prompting many public health agencies to renegotiate their roles and responsibilities with medical care providers and payers.1 Some agencies are scaling back their safety-net roles in the direct delivery of personal health services while expanding roles in supporting policy, system, and environmental changes that promote health and safety on a community-wide basis. Others are learning how to bill third-party payers for their services, and forging relationships with new delivery models such as accountable care organizations and patient-centered medical homes. Still others are forging new alliances with schools, worksites, retailers, farmers, housing authorities, and many other sectors to address the health issues embedded within other public and private sector decisions. Amid these changes, modern public health delivery systems are emerging as far more heterogeneous and multiorganizational than ever before.2

The complexity and diversity of these delivery systems create challenges for ensuring that everyone in the United States can benefit from the expanding array of research-tested programs, policies, and interventions that prevent disease and injury and promote health and safety on a population-wide basis. Knowledge about how best to organize, finance, and deliver these public health strategies in complex and constrained delivery systems is too often in short supply. The science surrounding the efficacy of individual public health interventions currently far outpaces the science surrounding the delivery system features and capabilities that support these interventions collectively in real-world settings.3 Consequently, implementation strategies that prove successful in one community may face political, economic, or logistical barriers in other settings. The growing heterogeneity of public health delivery systems demands a highly nuanced evidence base concerning which combination of public health strategies work best, in which organizational and community contexts, for which population segments, with what supporting infrastructure, and at what cost.4

The field of public health services and systems research (PHSSR) has become a leading source for this type of delivery system evidence in public health.5,6 In recent years, national research agendas have been established for the field in key areas of scholarship that include organization and structure, financing and economics, workforce, and information and communication technology.7–11 Dedicated research funding mechanisms have been created by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). A constellation of public health practice-based research networks has formed across the United States to support researcher–practitioner collaboration in the production and application of this type of research.12 And a national coordinating center devoted to PHSSR has formed to stimulate scientific innovation, strengthen analytic rigor, promote methodological consistency and comparability, and ensure real-world relevance in this work.

If PHSSR is to realize its full potential in guiding the transformation of the US public health system, it will require “open science” mechanisms for accelerating the production and distribution of highly nuanced research findings about public health delivery.13 Currently, public health delivery systems are changing at a rate that far outpaces traditional research production and distribution cycles, resulting in many missed opportunities for studying and learning from these natural experiments. Mechanisms are needed for rapidly sharing research methodologies and data with other scholars in the field, and for rapidly communicating research results to decision-makers within public health delivery systems. An obvious model is the CDC’s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), which widely and freely transmits brief summaries of findings from epidemiological studies to public health and medical professionals across the globe.

The PHSSR field now has its analog to MMWR in the form of a rapid-cycle, peer-reviewed journal Frontiers in Public Health Services and Systems Research.14 Like MMWR, Frontiers publishes short summaries of preliminary results and top-line findings from new PHSSR studies. These summaries focus on how new findings advance the science of PHSSR and inform the transformation of real-world public health delivery systems. Also like MMWR, Frontiers is freely available to both producers and users of the research, with the aim of achieving the broadest possible reach even in low-resource settings. Commentaries are published with some of these articles to help place the new research in context. Frontiers does not replace the need for fully developed empirical research articles, but rather it offers a mechanism for rapidly disseminating early findings and emerging methods, thereby accelerating the progress of PHSSR.

Beginning with this issue, the American Journal of Public Health (AJPH) will extend the reach of PHSSR studies by regularly publishing the abstracts of Frontiers articles along with full-text links. This partnership will allow both journals to play active roles in accelerating PHSSR production and application. AJPH’s wide reach to and credibility with the public health profession, combined with Frontier’s nimbleness in disseminating early and preliminary PHSSR evidence, makes this arrangement a high-value collaboration. The fruits of this collaboration, we believe, will help to transform the US public health system into a rapid-learning system in which research continually informs practice and practice continually motivates research.15 The result will be a continuously improving US public health system that seeks ever-better ways of deploying its resources for a healthier, safer, and more equitable nation.",WOS:000347210500013,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH

In this work we propose a unified approach to measure the reproducibility of findings identified from replicate experiments and identify putative discoveries using reproducibility. Unlike the usual scalar measures of reproducibility, our approach creates a curve, which quantitatively assesses when the findings are no longer consistent across replicates. Our curve is fitted by a copula mixture model, from which we derive a quantitative reproducibility score, which we call the \"irreproducible discovery rate\" (IDR) analogous to the FDR. This score can be computed at each set of paired replicate ranks and permits the principled setting of thresholds both for assessing reproducibility and combining replicates. Since our approach permits an arbitrary scale for each replicate, it provides useful descriptive measures in a wide variety of situations to be explored. We study the performance of the algorithm using simulations and give a heuristic analysis of its theoretical properties.

While the requirements and benefits of data exchange are widely discussed, there are few proposals on how to implement data platforms that not only permit the exchange of research data among researchers, but also permit to distribute research results and data to the interest public. We elaborate what points are important for implementing a (geographic) data repository and propose then to adopt the concept of Spatial Data Infrastructures (SDI) as a solution for the implementation of research data repositories. We present as a case study the geographic data and document repository of the Chilean research Centre on Sustainable Urban Development (CEDEUS), the CEDEUS Observatory. Besides the infrastructure to host and distribute data, communication tools are an important component of such a data repository service. For this case study we analyse which things have worked well and which things have not worked well based on the experiences collected during three years of operation. We close with some recommendations for the implementation of data repositories for research.","",""

But replication of scientific results is the heart of the scientific method; without this cornerstone we do not have science, we have faith and mysticism. Note, however, that reproducibility comes at a steep cost: more rigor, more scrutiny, and tightened controls on what is considered a publishable result will doubtless burden scientists and slow the pace of innovation.

Within these, categories of Discrimination and Feasibility relate to assay reproducibility and performance. 14–3-3eta (η) is a joint-derived biomarker that drives joint damage processes and informs radiographic progression independently of acute phase reactants. As an ELISA assay, 14–3-3η is currently available for clinical use as a laboratory developed test (LDT) in the United States (US) and as an in-vitro diagnostic (IVD) in Canada. The ELISA is (CE) marked for Europe and is Therapeutics Good Administration (TGA) approved for Australia. Previous studies have described 14–3-3eta assay equivalence at independent laboratories in the US and Canada. Objectives The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the reproducibility of 14–3-3eta measurements at two independent laboratories in Japan and one in Canada. Methods A total of 212 samples from the University of Occupational and Environmental Health were provided for this study. Serum 14–3-3eta measurements were performed using the 14–3-3eta ELISA provided by Augurex. Testing in Canada occurred in August 2015; these 14–3-3eta values were set as the “standard”. The 212 samples were shipped from Canada to Japan in January 2016 with testing being performed in February 2016. Testing at MBL was performed on a blinded-basis. Upon completion of testing, results were sent to the investigators at which point in time, MBL was unblinded. 14–3-3eta positivity was defined at ≥0.19ng/ml. Contigency and Spearman analyses were performed to assess the strength of the results between the two testing centres. Values above the linear range of the assay i.e. ≥20ng/ml were excluded for the Spearman analyses and determination of the median (IQR). A p-value of Results In Canada, of the 212 samples tested, 146 (68.8%) were 14–3-3eta positive and in Japan, 147 (69.3%) were positive. In Canada, 187 patients had reportable values in the linear range and in Japan 186 did. Median 14–3-3eta levels in Canada were 0.51 ng/ml (IQR: 0.11–2.09) and in Japan they were 0.58 ng/ml (IQR: 0.02–2.68), respectively. Spearman correlation analysis revealed a highly significant correlation between the two testing sites, r=0.92; p Conclusions As defined by the soluble biomarker sub-committee of OMERACT, reliability and standardization of biomarker assessments in routine clinical practice across the globe and in clinical studies is of high importance. The results presented herein demonstrate that the 14–3-3eta assay is highly reliable, that testing/delivery of results can be standardized between two independent laboratories, and that it is very stable over time and when shipped between continents.

This paper aimed to determine the feasibility of identification and measurement reproducibility of intracranial translucency (IT) in our population.



Methods

This is a prospective study in which five accredited operators attempted to identify and measure the IT during first-trimester sonographic screening for aneuploidy in 990 fetuses. The presence or absence of spina bifida was determined at the time of the second-trimester scan or after birth. Measurement reproducibility was assessed through intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) on a subgroup of 150 fetuses.



Results

Identification and measurement of the IT were possible in 961 (97%) cases. The mean IT anteroposterior diameter was 1.8 mm (SD ± 0.37; range 0.8–3.1), and the size increased linearly with advancing gestation (IT = 0.74 + 0.02 × crown–rump length; r2 = 0.15, p < 0.0001). The only fetus with spina bifida in this series presented with absent IT. Intra-observer and inter-observer ICCs were 0.79 and 0.75, respectively (95% confidence intervals 0.72–0.84 and 0.67–0.81, respectively; both p < 0.001).



Conclusions

The IT increases linearly with increasing crown–rump length and seems to be of value in the first-trimester detection of spina bifida. It is easy to identify and measure and shows excellent intra-observer and inter-observer reproducibility measurements. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",WOS:000301639300009,PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS

A core work of many postgraduate certificate in teaching and learning (PGCert) courses for new lecturers, it is studied, in the main, as a means to understand how to support and encourage students to achieve more effective learning. Communities of practice can also be applied to academics. In the context of the Research Excellence Framework (REF) and its predecessors, the gulf between research-focused and teaching-Focused academics in life sciences has widened, so that in many institutions, these two groups have evolved into two distinct communities of practice; one whose priority is disciplinary research, the other’s learning and teaching. However, in 2015, the UK government announced that a Teaching Excellence Framework (TEF) would be introduced into higher education in England, as early as 2017. While the exact details of TEF remain unclear, it is certain that “excellence” and “student satisfaction” will be high on the agenda. It is vital, therefore, that the two communities of practice, research-focused and teaching-focused, find ways to come together in order to ensure high quality teaching and learning. Wenger proposes that this can be done through the process of “brokering”, which allows expertise from both communities of practice to cross from one to the other, strengthening both. This should be encouraged at departmental and institutional level, but another vital origin of brokering can be forged at a(n) (inter)national level at meetings such as the SEB Annual Conference, where teaching-focused academics have the opportunity to mix with research-active colleagues. While this paper is informed by recent and current events in the UK Higher Education sector, it is of interest to academics who work in an environment where research and teaching have become separate to any extent.","",""

Efforts by scientific groups to promote reproducibility are focused mostly on measures aimed at reducing biases and errors related to experimental design and statistical analysis, some of which include reporting of data and methods fully, using control groups and blinding, and ensuring that studies are adequately powered.

Blindly chasing faulty results has incurred a huge waste of human and monetary resources. The damage to the progress of scientific discoveries, as well as their application to human well-being, cannot be overestimated. According to two reports by Bayer and Amgen published in 2011 and 2012, 64–89% of the so-called “landmark” results could not be reproduced in their pre-clinical validation experiments.1,2 One plausible explanation for this out of proportion irreproducibility is related to the intricacy of the scientific experiments, including the sourcing of reagent antibodies and cell lines, which are major sources of variations. To make validation meaningful, the study materials used in the original studies need to be authenticated so that variations due to the faulty materials can be prevented during follow-up studies. However, the technical complexity and the costs of authentication often discourage this practice in research laboratories. In addition to these obstacles, researchers are left with no standards to follow when validating their reagents and cell lines. Nevertheless, the ever-growing irreproducibility has created a sense of urgency in the medical research field, and the root of faulty science has to be tackled. Two recent commentaries in Nature and Nature Methods highlighted the importance of the quality control of antibody reagents and cell lines.3,4 Both commentaries extensively discussed the existing quality problems associated with antibody reagents and cultured cell lines. The authors followed their discussions by advocating policy solutions, as well as feasible standards, towards better authentication and validation. The main impetus of these discussions will certainly raise the awareness of these problems, and may change the attitudes among researchers, toward the goal of improving the sourcing of antibodies and cell lines.",WOS:000217136800001,GENES & DISEASES

The neuroscience community significantly benefits from the proliferation of imaging-related analysis software packages. Established packages such as SPM (Ashburner, 2012), the FMRIB Software Library (FSL) (Jenkinson et al., 2012), Freesurfer (Fischl, 2012), Slicer (Fedorov et al., 2012), and the AFNI toolkit (Cox, 2012) aid neuroimaging researchers around the world in performing complex analyses as part of ongoing neuroscience research. In conjunction with distributing robust software tools, neuroimaging packages also continue to incorporate algorithmic innovation for improvement in analysis tools.

As fellow scientists who actively participate in neuroscience research through our contributions to the Insight Toolkit1 (e.g., Johnson et al., 2007; Ibanez et al., 2009; Tustison and Avants, 2012) and other packages such as MindBoggle,2 Nipype3 (Gorgolewski et al., 2011), and the Advanced Normalization Tools (ANTs),4 (Avants et al., 2010, 2011) we notice an increasing number of publications that intend a fair comparison of algorithms which, in principle, is a good thing. Our concern is the lack of detail with which these comparisons are often presented and the corresponding possibility of instrumentation bias (Sackett, 1979) where “defects in the calibration or maintenance of measurement instruments may lead to systematic deviations from true values” (considering software as a type of instrument requiring proper “calibration” and “maintenance” for accurate measurements). Based on our experience (including our own mistakes), we propose a preliminary set of guidelines that seek to minimize such bias with the understanding that the discussion will require a more comprehensive response from the larger neuroscience community. Our intent is to raise awareness in both authors and reviewers to issues that arise when comparing quantitative algorithms. Although herein we focus largely on image registration, these recommendations are relevant for other application areas in biologically-focused computational image analysis, and for reproducible computational science in general. This commentary complements recent papers that highlight statistical bias (Kriegeskorte et al., 2009; Vul and Pashler, 2012), bias induced by registration metrics (Tustison et al., 2012), and registration strategy (Yushkevich et al., 2010) and guideline papers for software development (Prlic and Procter, 2012).",WOS:000346567300161,FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE

As I often tell my students, “If scientific psychology was easy, everyone would do it.” We can take some comfort in knowing that other sciences, too, face similar challenges (e.g., Begley & Ellis, 2012). But our business is with psychology. In August of this year, Science published a fascinating article by Brian Nosek and 269 coauthors (Open Science Collaboration, 2015). They reported direct replication attempts of 100 experiments published in prestigious psychology journals in 2008, including experiments reported in 39 articles in Psychological Science. Although I expect there is room to critique some of the replications, the article strikes me as a terrific piece of work, and I recommend reading it (and giving it to students). For each experiment, researchers prespecified a benchmark finding. On average, the replications had statistical power of .90+ to detect effects of the sizes obtained in the original studies, but fewer than half of them yielded a statistically significant effect. As Nosek and his coauthors made clear, even ideal replications of ideal studies are expected to fail some of the time (Francis, 2012), and failure to replicate a previously observed effect can arise from differences between the original and replication studies and hence do not necessarily indicate flaws in the original study (Maxwell, Lau, & Howard, 2015; Stroebe & Strack, 2014). Still, it seems likely that psychology journals have too often reported spurious effects arising from Type I errors (e.g., Francis, 2014).... Language: en",WOS:000366668200001,PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE

While several frameworks (de Leeuw (2015); McDonnell et al. (2012); Mason and Suri (2011); Lange et al. (2015)) have provided infrastructure and methods for individual research groups to develop paradigms, missing is a coordinated effort to develop paradigms linked with a system to easily deploy them. This disorganization leads to redundancy in development, divergent implementations of conceptually identical tasks, disorganized and error-prone code lacking documentation, and difficulty in replication. The ongoing reproducibility crisis in psychology and neuroscience research (Baker (2015); Open Science Collaboration (2015)) highlights the urgency of this challenge: reproducible research in behavioral psychology is conditional on deployment of equivalent experiments. A large, accessible repository of experiments for researchers to develop collaboratively is most efficiently accomplished through an open source framework. Here we present the Experiment Factory, an open source framework for the development and deployment of web-based experiments. The modular infrastructure includes experiments, virtual machines for local or cloud deployment, and an application to drive these components and provide developers with functions and tools for further extension. We release this infrastructure with a deployment (http://www.expfactory.org) that researchers are currently using to run a set of over 80 standardized web-based experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk. By providing open source tools for both deployment and development, this novel infrastructure holds promise to bring reproducibility to the administration of experiments, and accelerate scientific progress by providing a shared community resource of psychological paradigms.",WOS:000374735800001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY

More specifically, it is a conditio sine qua non for the realization of Open Science and at the same time it is indispensable for the monitoring and assessment of the quality and integrity of research. Various aspects play a role here: optimal infrastructures and tools for the actual handling of data during the research lifecycle, appropriate metadata to describe the datasets, and last but not least an adequate organizational framework to curate and archive the datasets professionally and provide optimal support and services to the researchers.The paper presents the Research Data Services (RDS) project of Radboud University (the Netherlands) in cooperation with one of the Dutch national research data archives: DANS (Data Archiving and Networked Services). In this project, a model is worked out for the archiving of research datasets via the CRIS (Current Research Information System) of the university, including both the registration of the metadata as well as the actual upload of the data files to the DANS archive. It is argued that an optimal solution is not only a technical matter, but also requires the definition and organization of appropriate support, management structures and workflows, involving both local and national partners. In this respect, attention is paid to the explanation of the frontoffice-backoffice model(FoBo) that is being defined and implemented as part of the project and which forms the organizational backbone of the solution worked out. The paper starts by arguing that aCRIS-oriented approach in research data archiving holds substantial added value, and it ends with an overview of lessons learned and a peek into the future of the RDS-project.",WOS:000398828200043,"13TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON CURRENT RESEARCH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, CRIS2016, COMMUNICATING AND MEASURING RESEARCH RESPONSIBLY: PROFILING, METRICS, IMPACT, INTEROPERABILITY"

At present, MOST primarily considers Clarivate Analytics journal impact factor (JIF), which is a proprietary scientometric measure, as a measure of “quality”. Academic publishing is however, starting to move away from metrics such as the JIF that can be gamed, and that do not truly reflect the academic worth of individual scientists, or of journals. Metrics such as altmetrics, which show the paper’s popularity among social media, or a greater balance of metrics, to buffer the monopolized impact of the JIF on metrics-based rewards systems, may be issues that China and MOST need to consider as global academic publishing tends towards a state of open science where open access journals that reach a wider audience may have greater value than journals with a high JIF. Not only are China’s academics well-funded by the state, the Chinese academic market is a highly coveted market by publishers and other parties interested in advancing their academic or commercial interests. Given the current fluid and rapidly evolving state of academic publishing, and the fairly rigid JIF-based rewards system in place in China at the moment, coupled with a recent spate in academic misconduct from Chinese researchers, this letter offers some suggestions as to the need for China to rethink its policies regarding what factors influence academic rewards.",WOS:000406497200034,SCIENTOMETRICS

Methods A random sample of 31 drug-event pairs from the French pharmacovigilance database was assessed by the consensual judgement of three experts (gold standard). Separately, a team from a pharmacovigilance centre (PhVC) and another from a pharmaceutical company assessed these pairs using the current method, then with the updated method. To test the inter- and intra-rater reproducibility, two seniors and two juniors from a PhVC and a pharmaceutical company assessed the pairs twice with the updated method. A weighted kappa coefficient was used to measure the agreement of the two causality assessment methods with the consensual expert judgement (validity) as well as the agreement of the updated causality assessment over time (intra-rater reproducibility) and between evaluators (interrater reproducibility). Results Agreement between the current method and consensual expert judgement was fair for the PhVC team (weighted kappa [K w ] 0.33) and moderate for the pharmaceutical company team (K w 0.41). For the updated method, agreement was better for both the PhVC (K w 0.58) and the pharmaceutical company (K w 0.52) teams. The inter- and intrarater reproducibility of the updated method based on the intrinsic imputability was satisfactory overall (K w 0.30-0.91).

Consequently, research should be well designed, rigorously analyzed, and reproducible.In response to a number of high profile cases in which published data could not be reproduced, as well as a mandate from the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) leadership has moved to address the issue of research reproducibility (1xPolicy: NIH plans to enhance reproducibility. Collins, F.S. and Tabak, L.A. Nature. 2014; 505: 612–613Crossref | PubMed | Scopus (205)See all References1). Toward this end, the NIH, together with the editors of Science and Nature, convened a meeting of scientific journal editors, including the editor of the Biophysical Journal (BJ), in June of 2014 to address the issue. As a follow-up to the meeting, in November of 2014 the NIH released Principles and Guidelines for Reporting Preclinical Research (http://www.nih.gov/about/reporting-preclinical-research.htm) and requested that publishers sign on to the document.The Biophysical Society (BPS), publisher of BJ, agrees wholeheartedly with the intent of the guidelines—to encourage reproducible, robust, and transparent research. However, in their specifics, these guidelines are primarily directed at large correlative statistical preclinical and clinical studies and are not pertinent or applicable to the types of science published by BJ. Therefore, BJ, along with several other basic science journals, did not sign on to the document.Basic and applied sciences in general, and biophysics in particular, can require the use of diverse, highly specialized research instrumentation and techniques along with complex customized computational analysis. The diversity of the research methods and the types of data that are produced requires a flexible approach to the important issues of reproducibility of scientific results, transparency, and data sharing. BJ, through its Biophysical Journal Author Guidelines, has already established requirements in support of transparency, rigor, and data sharing that also take into account the need for flexibility based on specific research areas. To ensure the continued health of the field in the face of changes in how biophysicists generate and analyze data, the BPS and BJ have updated those guidelines and will work with the biophysical community so that these guidelines reflect the specific needs of the different research areas. As research and techniques evolve, so too will the guidelines. The two basic principles that these Guidelines for the Reproducibility of Biophysics Research (http://www.cell.com/biophysj/authors) will strive to ensure are:1.Research results should be reported with sufficient detail to enable replication of the study in other laboratories (using supporting information as necessary); and2.Data or material produced in a published study should be readily disseminated and openly accessible whenever feasible (either as supporting information or through the author’s website and laboratory).BPS and BJ welcome this opportunity to help craft reproducibility guidelines that are both realistic and appropriate for the basic and applied research community, and will work with the various biophysics communities to establish appropriate data-sharing standards for each.",WOS:000352498100001,BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL

The reproducibility was calculated by means of the Intraclass Coefficient Correlation (ICC). The representation of the conformity between sessions by means of the method of Bland and Altman. The results suggest an acceptable reproducibility of the analyzed test. A moderate association has obtained between two test (MAT and 90oS, r = 0,74).

We aimed to translate Pedi-IKDC into Danish and assess its reproducibility and responsiveness in children with knee disorders. The translation complied with the international guidelines. Reproducibility was assessed in 53 children (15 years) responding Pedi-IKDC at baseline and after 3–14 days. For analysis of responsiveness, 94 children (15 years) responded Pedi-IKDC again after 3 months. Test–retest reliability was excellent. Intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.9, standard error of measurement was 4.1 points, and smallest detectable change (SDC) was 11.3 points. Evaluating responsiveness as a large effect was found in children reporting improvement compared with children reporting deterioration. The change score was correlated to the external anchor Global Rating Scale consisting of 15 answers from −7 “A very great deal worse” to +7 “A very great deal better,” with a Spearmen's rho of 0.45 (P > 0.001).

Three readers retrospectively performed ADC measurements of 31 breast lesions (16 malignant, 15 benign) and contralateral normal tissue in 26 women both unassisted (manual method) and assisted by a semiautomated software tool that excludes voxels below a dynamically specified signal intensity threshold. Reproducibility between readers for each technique was assessed by Bland-Altman analysis and concordance correlation coefficients (CCCs). Differences between readers' measured ADCs of lesions were smaller with the semiautomated tool vs the manual method. Concordance correlation coefficients for each reader pair were greater with the semiautomated tool for lesions (mean CCC difference, 0.11; 95% confidence interval, 0.04-0.26). For normal tissue, reader agreement was lower than for lesions and did not differ based on software tools (mean CCC difference, 0.00; 95% confidence interval, -0.14 to 0.13).

To address this, I propose several concrete actions universities could take to support open scholarship, and outline ways in which such initiatives could benefit the public as well as institutions.

Specific experiment definitions can be saved for later use or recalled as templates for modified tests. The user can then remotely execute the test on any connected physical experiment workbench in a real lab environment. Once the test is complete, eGor will capture an organized and metadata-rich research object that includes the raw test data, detailed definition of the test setup, and all procedural elements of the executed test such as the timings, test successions, device conditions, etc. The generated research object are stored for subsequent curating or data analysis, and any access or treatment of the results is automatically recorded to maintain data provenance. eGor also allows stored research objects to be shared with collaborators or provided to any institution that would be interested in reproducing the same results. The results may be inspected at various levels of detail, annotated and compared with other research objects. Thus, eGor would help researchers increase their confidence in their results and conclusions and promote improved research reproducibility. During this demonstrations the users will be allowed to interact with hardware blocks that mimic a simple lab setup, and the users may define, schedule and perform tests using these devices and save their test results as research objects.","",""

The concretion of this framework of RRI has been articulated by the EC around six key areas: governance, public engagement, gender equality, science education, open access, and open science and ethics. The indicators to measure these dimensions have been proposed recently. In our opinion the set of indicators available so far has two weaknesses: a lack of context-based indicators and a need for hierarchical ordering. Our aim is to provide tools for policy- and decision-makers that might need to identify the more important indicators in a specific context. In this work, we explored how the multicriteria analysis technique Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) can be used to prioritize indicators for RRI by involving experts in the specific context. The AHP method allowed weighting indicators according to experts in the different areas and producing four different options to select indicators. The method of AHP can be an appropriated instrument to select the most suitable indicators for RRI policies and initiatives.","",""

However, such initiatives may also adversely affect “open-science”. Based on matched surveys of almost 1000 researchers in Japan and over 800 in the US, the paper examines rates of commercial activity, reasons to patent, and secrecy related to research results. In particular, it examines the extent to which participation in commercial activity is associated with publication secrecy. The results show that patenting rates are higher in Japan, while industry funding is more common in the US. In addition, the overall level of publication secrecy is greater in Japan. And, in both countries, individuals who are commercially active are less likely to share their research results through publication.

In recent years, there is renewed enthusiasm about the prospect of achieving clinically useful tools capable of aiding the diagnosis and management of neuropsychiatric disorders. The present work explores the basis for this enthusiasm. We assert that there is no single advance that currently has the potential to drive the field of clinical brain imaging forward. Instead, there has been a constellation of advances that, if combined, could lead to the identification of objective brain imaging-based markers of illness. In particular, we focus on advances that are helping to (1) elucidate the research agenda for biological psychiatry (e.g., neuroscience focus, precision medicine), (2) shift research models for clinical brain imaging (e.g., big data exploration, standardization), (3) break down research silos (e.g., open science, calls for reproducibility and transparency), and (4) improve imaging technologies and methods.

We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on 2 popular National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) repositories: Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

By the example of production of ceramic brick three variants were shown, which are characterized by different values of reproducibility indexes. The probability of errors of the first and second kind was calculated, which indicate the probability of the situation when the controlled item is effective, but it will be erroneously considered to be defective, and when the controlled item is defective, but it can be wrongly considered to be effective.

Twenty subjects (51 ± 17 years, 11 men) had vascular ultrasound (Aloka Prosound α10) performed by two observers, at the level of the right common carotid artery for assessment of intima-media thickness (IMT), “wall tracking”, and “wave-intensity analysis”, and at the level of the right brachial artery for the assessment of flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Wave intensity is a hemodynamic index, evaluating ventriculo-arterial interaction and can be measured in real time by a double-beam ultrasound technique through simultaneous recording of carotid arterial blood flow velocity and diameter. Carotido-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined using the Complior method. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was assessed during a first session, when three consecutive acquisitions were made (first observer → second observer → first observer); repeatability was evaluated 1 week later (second observer). The most reproducible and repeatable parameters were PWV (intraobserver ±3.3%, interobserver ±2.6%, repeatability ±5.6%) and IMT (±3.7, ±4.3, ±4.9%, respectively). Intraobserver reproducibility for arterial stiffness and ventriculo-arterial coupling parameters was the highest for the beta index (±3.8%), and the lowest for the second systolic peak (±22.4%). Interobserver reproducibility and repeatability varied between very good for the wave speed (±5.5 and ±4.3%), and unsatisfactory for the negative area (±31.8 and ±38.6%). FMD had good reproducibility (intraobserver ±11.6%, interobserver ±8%, repeatability ±7%), whereas augmentation index had only satisfactory results (±17.8, ±8.4, ±23.8%, respectively).

Many reasons have been offered as explanations for failure to reproduce scientific research findings- from fraud to the issues related to design, conduct, analysis, or publishing scientific research. We also postulate a sensitive dependency on initial conditions by which small changes can result in the large differences in the research findings when attempted to be reproduced at later times. Methods: We employed a simple logistic regression equation to model the effect of covariates on the initial study findings. We then fed the input from the logistic equation into a logistic map function to model stability of the results in repeated experiments over time. We illustrate the approach by modeling effects of different factors on the choice of correct treatment. Results: We found that reproducibility of the study findings depended both on the initial values of all independent variables and the rate of change in the baseline conditions, the latter being more important. When the changes in the baseline conditions vary by about 3.5 to about 4 in between experiments, no research findings could be reproduced. However, when the rate of change between the experiments is ≤2.5 the results become highly predictable between the experiments. Conclusions: Many results cannot be reproduced because of the changes in the initial conditions between the experiments. Better control of the baseline conditions in-between the experiments may help improve reproducibility of scientific findings.","",""

To address this issue, we announce the launch of Preprints of the R-fMRI Network (PRN), a community funded preprint hosting service. PRN provides free-submission and free hosting of manuscripts for resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI) and neuroscience related studies. Submitted articles are openly discussed and receive feedback from readers and a panel of invited consultants from the R-fMRI Network.

Fueled by recent evidence that the results of many clinical trials of interventions in common use are never published or reported and that these studies are not missing at random, a persuasive argument has been made that all data from human trials should be available to inform clinical practice.1–6 This would also promote higher quality and higher integrity science, although some urge caution as a result of concerns about unintended adverse consequences.7

In response to these calls for action, some companies have stepped forward and demonstrated leadership. GlaxoSmithKline, in coordination with other companies such as Roche and ViiV, committed early to data sharing.8 Medtronic contracted with our research team, the Yale University Open Data Access Project,9 to conduct external reviews of its clinical trial data for a single product. In addition, we developed policies and procedures to share these data with other investigators. Importantly, Medtronic fully transferred the decision-making authority on how to share the data and who could receive the data to the Yale University Open Data Access Project. Janssen, the pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson, has now contracted to do the same for the trials under its auspices. Increasingly, other companies are announcing their intention to share data from all published and unpublished clinical trials.

Students were taught to use gestures to understand the idea of “opposing forces” in a concrete setting–the forces at play as tectonic plates move past each other–and then taught to use the gestures to understand opposing forces in more abstract situations. For example, students were taught to use gestures to understand the opposing sides of an argument, and to understand the internal conflicts that arise as individuals are faced with moral dilemmas. The results of our design study suggest that ERC has promise as a method for introducing students to the idea of using gesture to understand text content, and to employ this strategy in a range of reading contexts.

Introduction Whether having a conversation with friends, flipping through a magazine to pass the time on an airplane, or poring over a text to study for an exam, the creation of meaning lies at the heart of language use [1, 2]. The centrality of meaning and understanding to the use of language has been an important impetus behind the recent surge of interest in developing approaches and interven- tions to improve comprehension performance in school-age readers [3]. Compared to the great strides that have been made in improving some aspects of children’s literacy skills (such as the decoding processes needed to translate between orthographic symbols and phonological repre- sentations) [4], comparatively little progress has been made in improving comprehension skills [5]. Initiatives such as the Institute for Education Sciences’ Reading for Understanding (RFU) project (which funded the work reported here) have served to highlight the need to understand both the processes involved in reading comprehension, and the mechanisms through which teachers can intervene to support the development of comprehension skills in those students who struggle in this area. One Reading for Understanding Network team [6] has presented a multi-faceted approach to improving children’s reading comprehension abilities.

Method and Materials: Experiments were performed using a Nucletron microselectron V3 (30) HDR after loading device with Ir‐192 single stepping source, Fuji Capusla XL computed radiography(CR) cassette and its reader and an in‐house made phantom. The central part of the phantom, which has alternating strips of lead and Perspex was used to check the accuracy of dwell positions while the outer part of the phantom, which consists of four different materials, namely perspex, copper,aluminium and Styro‐foam, was used to measure reproducibility of dwell time. Images were exported via network as DICOM images for further analysis by ImageJ.Results: Positional error of an HDR source smaller than 1.0 mm can be detected. Hence, it is possible to regularly check dwell positions for selected transfer tubes of a treatment plan as a quick verification of dwell positions. Reproducibility of dwell time within 0.1 second could be verified. No effect of bending a transfer tube was observed for normal clinical situations. However, under extreme cases in which the transfer tube was highly bent, the source dwell position was changed by less than 0.5mm. Conclusion: The phantom was capable of detecting dwell positional error of 1.0 mm and reproducibility of dwell time of 0.1 second. For typical clinical scenarios in which transfer tubes are bent, no effect on dwell position was observed. The phantom can be used with radiographic films or CR cassette with the latter being a preferred tool, as hospitals are phasing out film processors in favour of digital technology.

—Hugh Walpole

Reproducibility is a fundamental tenet of the scientific process, and sharing of both data and methodology in a public forum is key to ensuring reproducibility of scientific findings. However, in recent years there has been increasing concern over the lack of reproducibility of many published scientific findings. This issue has been exacerbated by the rapid expansion of new publishing models, such as open-access journals and preprint servers, not all of which have same requirements with regard to data reproducibility and rigor of the review process. This is not a trivial issue, as irreproducible data can send basic and preclinical researchers down blind alleys, wasting both time and money.

This has prompted action by stakeholders in the integrity of the scientific process. Besides scientists, these include funders, academic societies, publishers, and, of course, the public, including patient-advocacy groups. For example, the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF) recently announced the Movember Foundation–PCF Scientific Reproducibility Initiative, which aims to accelerate translation of promising discoveries into new tests and treatments for prostate cancer through faster validation of the science underlying new experimental therapies. This past July, the Office of Science and Technology Policy and the National Economic Council asked how the federal government could leverage its role as a significant funder of scientific research to address the reproducibility issue.

Publishers and academic societies are also tackling this key issue. Nature Publishing Group (NPG) has taken an active lead in establishing means to fight irreproducibility. NPG introduced measures last year with a view to ensuring good reporting standards and improving the reproducibility of findings published in the pages of its life-science journals. One such measure is requiring completion of a checklist (http://www.nature.com/authors/policies/checklist.pdf). In June, NPG cohosted a meeting with the leadership of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and colleagues at Science magazine to examine the issues of reproducibility and rigor of research findings. The one-day workshop brought together editors representing 30 basic- and preclinical-research journals, which had been selected by the NIH based on frequency of publication of their grantees. The objective was to discuss the measures that some journals have already taken and to agree on a common set of minimum measures to which all participants could subscribe that would be presented to the larger community for consideration.

The workshop participants came to consensus on a set of principles to facilitate these goals, which has been published on the NIH website (http://www.nih.gov/about/reporting-preclinical-research.htm) along with a list of endorsing journals (http://www.nih.gov/about/endorsing-jounals.htm). NPG has, of course, endorsed these principles, as has the American Society of Gene Therapy's Molecular Therapy family of journals. A key factor in data reproducibility is effective and comprehensive description of methodology. The advent of online supplements has rendered moot traditional considerations regarding the size of print publications and authors should not feel constrained by space limitations. The aim of the agreed principles is to facilitate interpretation and repetition of experiments as they were conducted in the published studies. They include guidelines for statistical analyses and for transparency in reporting key methodology, analytical information, and reagents, and mandates for data and material sharing. Editors of the MT family of journals will continue to ask reviewers to comment on whether, in their view, there is sufficient description of methodology to allow independent reproduction of the data. Many of our authors already conform to these principals, and, although these additional requirements will impose a small added burden on other authors, we are confident that, overall, the time and effort saved as a consequence of improved reproducibility will more than outweigh any inconvenience.",WOS:000345822600001,MOLECULAR THERAPY

We posit that a contributor is simply a lack of specificity that is required to enable adequate research reproducibility. In particular, the inability to uniquely identify research resources, such as antibodies and model organisms, makes it difficult or impossible to reproduce experiments even where the science is otherwise sound. In order to better understand the magnitude of this problem, we designed an experiment to ascertain the “identifiability” of research resources in the biomedical literature. We evaluated recent journal articles in the fields of Neuroscience, Developmental Biology, Immunology, Cell and Molecular Biology and General Biology, selected randomly based on a diversity of impact factors for the journals, publishers, and experimental method reporting guidelines. We attempted to uniquely identify model organisms (mouse, rat, zebrafish, worm, fly and yeast), antibodies, knockdown reagents (morpholinos or RNAi), constructs, and cell lines. Specific criteria were developed to determine if a resource was uniquely identifiable, and included examining relevant repositories (such as model organism databases, and the Antibody Registry), as well as vendor sites. The results of this experiment show that 54% of resources are not uniquely identifiable in publications, regardless of domain, journal impact factor, or reporting requirements. For example, in many cases the organism strain in which the experiment was performed or antibody that was used could not be identified. Our results show that identifiability is a serious problem for reproducibility. Based on these results, we provide recommendations to authors, reviewers, journal editors, vendors, and publishers. Scientific efficiency and reproducibility depend upon a research-wide improvement of this substantial problem in science today.",WOS:000209189200002,PEERJ

A number of studies have documented interobserver variability for a single antibody clone but few have evaluated reproducibility between antibody clones and which clones demonstrate the highest degree of interobserver reproducibility. Design We studied a series of 93 cases stained by both the HercepTest™ and the 4B5 clone for interobserver reproducibility. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections were stained by the immunohistochemical technique using the manufactures directions for both the HercepTest™ and the 4B5 clone. FISH testing was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections according to the PathVysion HER-2 DNA probe kit instructions. Results Absolute agreement rate for Hercep was 85%. Absolute agreement for 4B5 was 69%. This difference was statistically significant ( p p Conclusion Agreement between evaluators was greater with the HercepTest. However, agreement with FISH results was superior for the 4B5 clone. Interobserver agreement was less than the 95% agreement threshold recommended by the ASCO/CAP guidelines for development of a new testing method for HER2 evaluation.",WOS:000372388100006,PATHOLOGY RESEARCH AND PRACTICE

The reproducibility of hippocampal atrophy rate for FSL/FIRST, AdaBoost, FreeSurfer, MAPS independently and MAPS combined with the boundary shift integral (MAPS-HBSI) were calculated. Back-to-back (BTB) 3D T1-weighted MPRAGE MRI from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI1) study at baseline and year one were used. Analysis on 3 groups of subjects was performed – 562 subjects at 1.5T, a 75 subject group that also had manual segmentation and 111 subjects at 3T. A simple and novel statistical test based on the binomial distribution was used that handled outlying data points robustly. Median hippocampal atrophy rates were −1.1%/year for healthy controls, −3.0%/year for mildly cognitively impaired and −5.1%/year for AD subjects. The best reproducibility was observed for MAPS-HBSI (1.3%), while the other methods tested had reproducibilities at least 50% higher at 1.5T and 3T which was statistically significant. For a clinical trial, MAPS-HBSI should require less than half the subjects of the other methods tested. All methods had good accuracy versus manual segmentation. The MAPS-HBSI method has substantially better reproducibility than the other methods considered.",WOS:000377354600004,PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH-NEUROIMAGING

Technological advances now allow orthodontists to take these measurements on digital models. In this study, we aimed to assess the accuracy, reproducibility, and time efficiency of dental measurements taken on 3 types of digital models. Methods emodels (GeoDigm, Falcon Heights, Minn), SureSmile models (OraMetrix, Richardson, Tex), and AnatoModels (Anatomage, San Jose, Calif) were made for 30 patients. Mesiodistal tooth-width measurements taken on these digital models were timed and compared with those on the corresponding plaster models, which were used as the gold standard. Accuracy and reproducibility were assessed using the Bland-Altman method. Differences in time efficiency were tested for statistical significance with 1-way analysis of variance. Results Measurements on SureSmile models were the most accurate, followed by those on emodels and AnatoModels. Measurements taken on SureSmile models were also the most reproducible. Measurements taken on SureSmile models and emodels were significantly faster than those taken on AnatoModels and plaster models. Conclusions Tooth-width measurements on digital models can be as accurate as, and might be more reproducible and significantly faster than, those taken on plaster models.

It has long been accepted that building research on the foundations laid by other scientists is both effective and efficient. Regrettably, some disciplines, chemistry being one, have been slow to recognise the value of sharing and have thus been reluctant to curate their data and information in preparation for exchanging it. The very significant increases in both the volume and the complexity of the datasets produced has encouraged the expansion of e-Research, and stimulated the development of methodologies for managing, organising, and analysing “big data”. We review the evolution of cheminformatics, the amalgam of chemistry, computer science, and information technology, and assess the wider e-Science and e-Research perspective. Chemical information does matter, as do matters of communicating data and collaborating with data. For chemistry, unique identifiers, structure representations, and property descriptors are essential to the activities of sharing and exchange. Open science entails the sharing of more than mere facts: for example, the publication of negative outcomes can facilitate better understanding of which synthetic routes to choose, an aspiration of the Dial-a-Molecule Grand Challenge. The protagonists of open notebook science go even further and exchange their thoughts and plans. We consider the concepts of preservation, curation, provenance, discovery, and access in the context of the research lifecycle, and then focus on the role of metadata, particularly the ontologies on which the emerging chemical Semantic Web will depend. Among our conclusions, we present our choice of the “grand challenges” for the preservation and sharing of chemical information.","",""

This turning point, consisting in a movement from a Marshallian interpretation of classical political economy (where Marshall’s theory was considered ‘not at all incompatible’ with Marx) to the rediscovery of an alternative theory of value and distribution, was described as an ‘endogenous’ path. According to de Vivo's ‘exogenous’ path, instead, the draft of the Sraffa’s ‘first equations’ (where the absence of a surplus is assumed), would demonstrate the existence of an autonomous development starting out from Marx’s schemes of reproduction. In the present paper, the author provides new evidence, based on Sraffa’s manuscripts, on the intermesh of post-Marshallian problems with themes deriving from the classical economists. In contrast with de Vivo's statement that Sraffa's writings belonging to the ‘Marshallian phase’ would not bear any connection with the work undertaken for the 1960 book, it is shown that this continuity exists, and it is meaningful.

Materials and Methods Five dentate and 5 edentate patients were selected at random from the CBCT database. Two independent observers traced both the left and the right mandibular canal using 3-dimensional image-based planning software (Procera System NobelGuide; Nobel Biocare, Goteborg, Sweden). All mandibular canals were traced using 3 different methods. Method I was based on coronal views, also known as cross-sections. Panorama-like reconstructions were the starting point for method II. The third method combined methods I and II. Results With respect to interobserver reliability, no significant difference ( P = .34) for the various methods was observed. The reproducibility was better in edentate than in dentate jaws ( P = .0015). The difference between 2 tracings was the lowest for the combined method: within a range of 1.3 mm in 95% of the course of the canal. The most obvious deviations were mainly seen in the anterior part of the canal. Conclusions The best reproducible method for mandibular canal tracing is the combined method III. Between observers, still a mean 95th percentile deviation threshold of 1.3 mm (SD 0.384) is noted, indicating that a safety zone of 1.7 mm should be respected. When planning surgery on CBCT-based data, surgeons should be aware of the obvious deviations located in the region of the anterior loop of the canal.",WOS:000276579200016,JOURNAL OF ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGERY

The proposed algorithm termed VIP-CARS combined the two metrics in a sequential and iterative manner, rather than directly introducing VIP into CARS-PLS. This approach is particularly attractive for quantification due to its relatively higher reproducibility and robustness compared to the CARS procedure. The method was tested on datasets taken from the corn and Rukuaixiao Tablets. It was shown that a small number of well-defined relevant spectral variables were identified with the proposed approach, providing easy spectral interpretation and high creditability. Moreover, with the implementation of the VIP-CARS algorithm, the prediction performance of the final model and the reproducibility of the selected wavelengths were also improved.","",""

The popularity of R has grown rapidly over the past two decades and the number of users and packages is increasing at a near exponential rate. This rapid growth has prompted a number of formal and informal online and text resources, the volume of which is beginning to present challenges to novices learning R. Students are often first exposed to R in upper division undergraduate classes or during their graduate studies. The way R is presented likely has consequences for the fundamental understanding of the program and language itself; user comprehension of R may be better if learning the language itself followed by conducting analyses, compared to someone who is learning another subject (e.g. statistics) using R for the first time. Consequently, an understanding of the approaches to R education is critical. Methods: To establish how students are exposed to R, we used a survey to evaluate the current use in Canadian university courses, including the context in which R is presented and the types of uses of R in the classroom. Additionally, we looked at the reasons professors either do or don’t use/teach R. Results: We found that R is used in a broad range of course disciplines beyond statistics (e.g. ecology) and just over one half of Canadian universities have at least one course that uses R. Discussion and Conclusions: Developing programming-literate students is of utmost importance and our hope is that this benchmark study will influence how post-secondary educators, as well as other programmers, approach R, specifically when developing educational and supplemental content in online, text, and package-specific formats aiding in student’s comprehension of the R language.","",""

The ability of external investigators to reproduce published scientific findings is critical for the evaluation and validation of biomedical research by the wider community. However, a substantial proportion of health research using electronic health records (EHR), data collected and generated during clinical care, is potentially not reproducible mainly due to the fact that the implementation details of most data preprocessing, cleaning, phenotyping and analysis approaches are not systematically made available or shared. With the complexity, volume and variety of electronic health record data sources made available for research steadily increasing, it is critical to ensure that scientific findings from EHR data are reproducible and replicable by researchers. Reporting guidelines, such as RECORD and STROBE, have set a solid foundation by recommending a series of items for researchers to include in their research outputs.

However, little is known about the test-retest reproducibility of such measures, particularly in the context of multisite studies. Here, we report the reproducibility of automated Freesurfer hippocampal subfields segmentations in 65 healthy elderly enrolled in a consortium of 13 3T MRI sites (five subjects per site). Participants were scanned in two sessions (test and retest) at least one week apart. Each session included two anatomical 3D T1 MRI acquisitions harmonized in the consortium. We evaluated the test-retest reproducibility of subfields segmentation (i) to assess the effects of averaging two within-session T1 images and (ii) to compare subfields with whole hippocampus volume and spatial reliability. We found that within-session averaging of two T1 images significantly improved the reproducibility of all hippocampal subfields but not that of the whole hippocampus. Volumetric and spatial reproducibility across MRI sites were very good for the whole hippocampus, CA2-3, CA4-dentate gyrus (DG), subiculum (reproducibility error∼2% and DICE > 0.90), good for CA1 and presubiculum (reproducibility error ∼ 5% and DICE ∼ 0.90), and poorer for fimbria and hippocampal fissure (reproducibility error ∼ 15% and DICE < 0.80). Spearman's correlations confirmed that test-retest reproducibility improved with volume size. Despite considerable differences of MRI scanner configurations, we found consistent hippocampal subfields volumes estimation. CA2-3, CA4-DG, and sub-CA1 (subiculum, presubiculum, and CA1 pooled together) gave test-retest reproducibility similar to the whole hippocampus. Our findings suggest that the larger hippocampal subfields volume may be reliable longitudinal markers in multisite studies.

Even when a compendium is available, reviewers and readers may have difficulties in verifying the results on platforms different from the ones where the experiments were originally run. As a step towards simplifying the process of creating reproducible experiments, we have developed ReproZip, a tool that automatically captures the provenance of experiments and packs all the necessary files, library dependencies and variables to reproduce the results. Reviewers can then unpack and run the experiments without having to install any additional software. We will demonstrate real use cases for ReproZip, how packages are created, and how reviewers can validate and explore experiments.","",""

We evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of four previously proposed automatic brain tissue segmentation methods: FAST, SPM5, an automatically trained k -nearest neighbor (kNN) classifier, and a conventional kNN classifier based on a prior training set. The intensity nonuniformity correction and skull-stripping mask were the same for all methods. Evaluations were performed on MRI scans of elderly subjects derived from the general population. Accuracy was evaluated by comparison to two manual segmentations of MRI scans of six subjects (mean age 65.9 ± 4.4 years). Reproducibility was assessed by comparing the automatic segmentations of 30 subjects (mean age 57.0 ± 3.7 years) who were scanned twice within a short time interval. All methods showed good accuracy and reproducibility, with only small differences between methods. The conventional kNN classifier was the most accurate method with similarity indices of 0.82/0.90/0.94 for cerebrospinal fluid/gray matter/white matter, but it showed the lowest reproducibility. FAST yielded the most reproducible segmentation volumes with volume difference standard deviations of 0.55/0.49/0.38 (percentage of intracranial volume) respectively. The results of the reproducibility experiment can be used to calculate the required number of subjects in the design of a longitudinal study with sufficient power to detect changes over time in brain (tissue) volume. Example sample size calculations demonstrate a rather large effect of the choice of segmentation method on the required number of subjects.",WOS:000277532900011,NEUROIMAGE

They are modelled by scientific workflows which describes the data or control flow between the consecutive computational tasks. Since these experiments are data and compute intensive they need parallel and distributed infrastructures to be enacted (grids, clusters, clouds and supercomputers). The complexity of the infrastructures and the continuously changing environment faces us a big challenge in reproducibility, which is often needed for results sharing or for judging scientific claims in the scientists' community. The necessary parameters of reproducible workflows can be originated from different sources (infrastructural, third party, or related to the binaries), which may change or become unavailable during the process of re-execution. However in most cases the lack of the original parameters can be compensated by replacing, evaluating or simulating the value of the descriptors with some extra cost in order to make it reproducible.

Computers are now essential in all branches of science, but most researchers are never taught the equivalent of basic lab skills for research computing. As a result, data can get lost, analyses can take much longer than necessary, and researchers are limited in how effectively they can work with software and data. Computing workflows need to follow the same practices as lab projects and notebooks, with organized data, documented steps, and the project structured for reproducibility, but researchers new to computing often don't know where to start. This paper presents a set of good computing practices that every researcher can adopt, regardless of their current level of computational skill. These practices, which encompass data management, programming, collaborating with colleagues, organizing projects, tracking work, and writing manuscripts, are drawn from a wide variety of published sources from our daily lives and from our work with volunteer organizations that have delivered workshops to over 11,000 people since 2010.",WOS:000404565400007,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

Aims:  To conduct an internet-based study using virtual slides (VS) of sterotactic core biopsy specimens of non-palpable breast lesions in order to evaluate interobserver reproducibility between pathologists.



Methods and results:  A total of 18 breast lesions, determined to be histologically complex by two pathologists, were selected. Digitized VSs were then created using QuickTime Virtual Reality technology (Apple, Cupertino, CA, USA) and posted on the world-wide web. In all, 10 pathologists completed the evaluations of 18 VSs using the five diagnostic categories (B1–B5) from the European guidelines for quality assurance in breast cancer screening and diagnosis. Their results were compared with those of every other participating pathologist, and were then individually compared with the results of a highly experienced breast pathologist (referee). Of the 18 cases, 10 (56%) were classified by the referee as borderline (B3 and B4). Comparisons with reference values showed a less than satisfactory level of reproducibility (median κw = 0.60). As regards interobserver reproducibility, results showed that, in general, the level of agreement was not satisfactory (median κw = 0.53).



Conclusions:  Overall, the findings are comparable to those quality control studies using circulating slides when analysis is done on borderline cases.",WOS:000277166300006,HISTOPATHOLOGY

They could also be used in continuing education. This study evaluates this educational impact. METHODS: Two series of clinical data and I-123 fluoropropyl-carbomethoxy-iodophenyl- nortropane single photon emission tomography images from 12 patients were prepared before initiating the study. Each series covered similarly a wide spectrum of clinical situations and images. Nuclear medicine physicians having experience with I-123 fluoropropyl-carbomethoxy-iodophenyl-nortropane single photon emission tomography were recruited and assigned two similar groups regarding their level of experience and type of institutions from which they were issued. Clinical data and images were transmitted by e-mail. For each case, observers had to choose among three answers: normal, equivocal, and abnormal. Answers were returned anonymously. Before the second series was sent, observers from group A had a collegiate discussion on the results of the first series of cases. Observers from group B received the second series without any information regarding analysis of series 1. RESULTS: In group A, median agreement increased from 75% (series 1) to 100% (series 2); in group B it was 75% (series 1) and 87% (series 2). In group A, a 100% agreement was observed for four cases (series 1) and for eight cases (series 2). In group B, a 100% agreement was observed for four cases for both series. CONCLUSION: These preliminary results, obtained in a small sample of observers, suggest that participating and discussing results of interobserver reproducibility studies seems to have a positive educational impact and therefore improves interobserver reproducibility. © 2011 Wolters Kluwer Health",WOS:000289761500013,NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS

Moreover, scientific publications are preserved in a digital library archive. It is challenging to identify the data usage that is mentioned in literature and associate it with its source. Here, we investigated the data usage of a government-funded cancer genomics project, The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), via a full-text literature analysis. Design/methodology/approach: We focused on identifying articles using the TCGA dataset and constructing linkages between the articles and the specific TCGA dataset. First, we collected 5,372 TCGA-related articles from PubMed Central (PMC). Second, we constructed a benchmark set with 25 full-text articles that truly used the TCGA data in their studies, and we summarized the key features of the benchmark set. Third, the key features were applied to the remaining PMC full-text articles that were collected from PMC. Findings: The amount of publications that use TCGA data has increased significantly since 2011, although the TCGA project was launched in 2005. Additionally, we found that the critical areas of focus in the studies that use the TCGA data were glioblastoma multiforme, lung cancer, and breast cancer; meanwhile, data from the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) platform is the most preferable for use. Research limitations: The current workflow to identify articles that truly used TCGA data is labor-intensive. An automatic method is expected to improve the performance. Practical implications: This study will help cancer genomics researchers determine the latest advancements in cancer molecular therapy, and it will promote data sharing and data-intensive scientific discovery. Originality/value: Few studies have been conducted to investigate data usage by governmentfunded projects/programs since their launch. In this preliminary study, we extracted articles that use TCGA data from PMC, and we created a link between the full-text articles and the source data.","",""

Design Diagnostic accuracy and inter-rater agreement study. Methods Immediate care, match day and team doctors involved in the 2015 Rugby Union World Cup viewed 20 video clips showing broadcaster's footage of head impact events occurring during elite Rugby matches. Subjects subsequently recorded whether any criteria warranting permanent removal from play or medical room head injury assessment were present. The accuracy of these ratings were compared to consensus expert opinion by calculating mean sensitivity and specificity across raters. The reproducibility of doctor's decisions was additionally assessed using raw agreement and Gwets AC1 chance corrected agreement coefficient. Results Forty rugby medicine doctors were included in the study. Compared to the expert reference standard overall sensitivity and specificity of doctors decisions were 77.5% (95% CI 73.1–81.5%) and 53.3% (95% CI 48.2–58.2%) respectively. Overall there was raw agreement of 67.8% (95% CI 57.9–77.7%) between doctors across all video clips. Chance corrected Gwets AC1 agreement coefficient was 0.39 (95% CI 0.17–0.62), indicating fair agreement. Conclusions Rugby World Cup doctors' demonstrated moderate accuracy and fair reproducibility in head injury event decision making when assessing video clips of head impact events.

Materials Pretreatment (T0) and postdistalization (T1) lateral cephalograms of 40 patients with a Class II molar relationship were used. Using the mesial cusp tip, distal crown contour, and centroid, 6 linear and 3 angular measurements were evaluated. The intraexaminer and interexaminer reliabilities were assessed with the Bland-Altman method. The T0 to T1 differences were compared by analysis of variance, followed by multiple comparisons with the Bonferroni adjustment. Results The greatest intraexaminer agreement intervals were correlated with centroid for tipping and vertical movement, and with distal crown contour for anteroposterior movement at T0 and T1. The narrowest interexaminer agreement intervals were observed with mesial cusp tip for all measurements and comparisons at both time points, except for the anteroposterior measurements at T1. Statistical significance was observed between the measurements made with mesial cusp tip and distal crown contour for tipping and with mesial cusp tip and centroid for distalization. For vertical movement, the treatment changes were statistically significantly greater with distal crown contour. Conclusions Mesial cusp tip was the most repeatable and reproducible landmark. Clinically unimportant differences were found in some comparisons of treatment changes obtained by different landmarks.",WOS:000388102700019,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

Relative to the classical diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model, FWE is also expected to increase sensitivity to microstructural changes in longitudinal studies. However, it is not clear if these two models differ in their test–retest reproducibility. This study compares a bi-tensor model for FWE with DTI by extending a previous longitudinal-reproducibility 3T multisite study (10 sites, 7 different scanner models) of 50 healthy elderly participants (55–80 years old) scanned in two sessions at least 1 week apart. We computed the reproducibility of commonly used DTI metrics (FA: fractional anisotropy, MD: mean diffusivity, RD: radial diffusivity, and AXD: axial diffusivity), derived either using a DTI model or a FWE model. The DTI metrics were evaluated over 48 white-matter regions of the JHU-ICBM-DTI-81 white-matter labels atlas, and reproducibility errors were assessed. We found that relative to the DTI model, FWE significantly reduced reproducibility errors in most areas tested. In particular, for the FA and MD metrics, there was an average reduction of approximately 1% in the reproducibility error. The reproducibility scores did not significantly differ across sites. This study shows that FWE improves sensitivity and is thus promising for clinical applications, with the potential to identify more subtle changes. The increased reproducibility allows for smaller sample size or shorter trials in studies evaluating biomarkers of disease progression or treatment effects.

will result in a low probability of independent studies reaching the same outcome (lack of replicability). After outlining the

Center for Open Science (COS), we present clear guidelines and tutorials on what we think open practices represent for behavioral
ecologists. In addition, we indicate some of the currently most appropriate and freely available tools for adopting these practices.
Finally, we suggest that all journals in our field, such as Behavioral Ecology, give additional weight to transparent studies and therefore
provide greater incentives to align our scientific practices to our scientific values. Overall, we argue that producing demonstrably

Disruptions of brain anatomical connectivity are believed to play a central role in several neurological and psychiatric illnesses. The structural brain connectome is typically derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which may be influenced by methodological factors related to signal processing, MRI scanners and biophysical properties of neuroanatomical regions. In this study, we evaluated how these variables affect the reproducibility of the structural connectome.
Methods 
Twenty healthy adults underwent 3 MRI scanning sessions (twice in the same MRI scanner and a third time in a different scanner unit) within a short period of time. The scanning sessions included similar T1 weighted and DTI sequences. Deterministic or probabilistic tractography was performed to assess link weight based on the number of fibers connecting gray matter regions of interest (ROI). Link weight and graph theory network measures were calculated and reproducibility was assessed through intra-class correlation coefficients, assuming each scanning session as a rater.
Results 
Connectome reproducibility was higher with data from the same scanner. The probabilistic approach yielded larger reproducibility, while the individual variation in the number of tracked fibers from deterministic tractography was negatively associated with reproducibility. Links connecting larger and anatomically closer ROIs demonstrated higher reproducibility. In general, graph theory measures demonstrated high reproducibility across scanning sessions.
Discussion 
Anatomical factors and tractography approaches can influence the reproducibility of the structural connectome and should be factored in the interpretation of future studies. Our results demonstrate that connectome mapping is a largely reproducible technique, particularly as it relates to the geometry of network architecture measured by graph theory methods.",WOS:000360613800024,PLOS ONE

Since the 1994 Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights agreements, the growing commoditisation of knowledge has extended the role of closed science and closed markets at the expense of open science and open markets.

Determining if an experiment is reproducible entails two separate tasks: re-executing the experiment and validating the results. Existing reproducibility efforts have focused on the former, envisioning techniques and infrastructures that make it easier to re-execute an experiment. In this position paper, we focus on the latter by analyzing the validation workflow that an experiment re-executioner goes through. We notice that validating results is done on the basis of experiment design and high-level goals, rather than exact quantitative metrics. Based on this insight, we introduce a declarative format for specifying the high-level components of an experiment as well as describing generic, testable conditions that serve as the basis for validation. We present a use case in the area of distributed storage systems to illustrate the usefulness of this approach.","",""

The purpose of this paper is threefold: to focus on the process of multilingual concept scheme construction and the challenges involved; to addresses concrete challenges faced in the construction process and especially those related to equivalence between terms and concepts; and to briefly outlines the translation strategies developed during the process of concept scheme construction.




Design/methodology/approach




The analysis is based on experience acquired during the establishment of the Finnish thesaurus and ontology service Finto as well as the trilingual General Finnish Ontology YSO, both of which are being maintained and further developed at the National Library of Finland.




Findings




Although uniform resource identifiers can be considered language-independent, they do not render concept schemes and their construction free of language-related challenges. The fundamental issue with all the challenges faced is how to maintain consistency and predictability when the nature of language requires each concept to be treated individually. The key to such challenges is to recognise the function of the vocabulary and the needs of its intended users.




Social implications




Open science increases the transparency of not only research products, but also metadata tools. Gaining a deeper understanding of the challenges involved in their construction is important for a great variety of users – e.g. indexers, vocabulary builders and information seekers. Today, multilingualism is an essential aspect at both the national and international information society level.

The scale, investment and organization of it are being compared to the Human Genome Project (HGP), which has exemplified ‘big science’ for biology. In line with the trend towards Big Data in genomic research, the promise of the BRAIN Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project, rests on the possibility to amass vast quantities of data to model the complex interactions between the brain and behaviour and inform the diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. Advocates of this ‘data driven’ paradigm in neuroscience argue that harnessing the large quantities of data generated across laboratories worldwide has numerous methodological, ethical and economic advantages, but it requires the neuroscience community to adopt a culture of data sharing and open access to benefit from them. In this article, we examine the rationale for data sharing among advocates and briefly exemplify these in terms of new ‘open neuroscience’ projects. Then, drawing on the frequently invoked model of data sharing in genomics, we go on to demonstrate the complexities of data sharing, shedding light on the sociological and ethical challenges within the realms of institutions, researchers and participants, namely dilemmas around public/private interests in data, (lack of) motivation to share in the academic community, and potential loss of participant anonymity.

In practice, data interpretation relies on visual and semiquantitative analyses. Good interobserver reproducibility is a prerequisite before claiming the robustness of a technique. This study aimed at evaluating interobserver reproducibility of this approach. Methods: Thirty nuclear medicine physicians participated in the study. Data included FP-CIT images and semiquantitative measurements of 12 cases, covering a wide spectrum of scintigraphic patterns and for which a 'true' clinical diagnosis based on long-term follow-up was available. Interobserver agreement was defined, for each case, as the highest percentage reached among the three proposed answers with complete agreement arbitrarily set at 80% or more. Variability in an individual observer's sensitivity to assess data as normal, equivocal or abnormal was scored using a three-point scale. Results: Response rate was 99.7%. Among the three possible answers, 'normal' accounted for 41.2% of the total, 'abnormal' for 49.8% and 'equivocal' for 8.1%. The mean interobserver agreement was 76% (range: 37-100%), with complete agreement being reached only in five cases. The interpretation proposed by most observers accorded to clinical diagnosis in 75% of the cases. Abnormalities of the central nervous system were encountered in all the cases with disagreement between the observer's interpretation and clinical diagnoses. An important variability in the observers sensitivity was seen. Conclusion: In the particular setting of this preliminary study evaluating the reproducibility of FP-CIT single-photon emission computed tomography interpretation in a group of nuclear medicine physicians with various experiences, interobserver agreement was suboptimal. Collegial discussion and standardized interpretation criteria could contribute to an improved reproducibility. © 2010 Wolters Kluwer Health",WOS:000280108900004,NUCLEAR MEDICINE COMMUNICATIONS

Nearly half of all clinical trials are never published [2–4]; those that are often exclude important data and may face long delays to publication [5–6], and individual patient level data has rarely been available for re-analysis [7–8]. Moreover, financial conflicts of interest have been associated with actions that have had the potential to bias the conduct and dissemination of clinical research. All of these foundational weaknesses were at issue when a series of publications in the Spine Journal [1] suggested that the investigators behind the key publications supporting rhBMP-2 had significant financial conflicts of interest and that the published reports of these industry-sponsored studies may have incompletely reported important adverse events.

In response to these concerns, Medtronic (Minneapolis, Minnesota) provided the Yale University Open Data Access (YODA) Project with the opportunity to apply its model [9–10] of data transparency and data stewardship to clarify the effectiveness and safety of rhBMP-2. This model entailed the oversight of two independent systematic reviews based on individual patient level data from all clinical trials conducted by Medtronic and the subsequent availability to scientists of the individual patient-level data from the trials. As part of this initiative, Medtronic fully granted jurisdiction over the data to the YODA Project and funded the effort. This project was conceived as a new type of industry-academic partnership to address the problem of unpublished and selectively published clinical evidence, with the hope of advancing open science, developing norms for good stewardship of clinical trial data, and serving patients and society, all while respecting legitimate industry concerns about the use of previously proprietary clinical trial data.",WOS:000337419100009,SPINE

Background: The SYNTAX score appears to have an important role to play in the evaluation of patients with complex coronary artery disease undergoing revascularisation. However, the calculation of the SYNTAX score relies on the subjective assessment of lesions using coronary angiography, and therefore is subject to intra-and inter-observer variability. Methods: The SYNTAX score was calculated in 100 patients randomly selected from the SYNTAX trial, on two occasions 8 weeks apart, by a team made up of three interventional cardiologists. The weighted kappa values were compared with values obtained 1 year previously, when core lab analysts assessed the intra-observer reproducibility amongst the same patient cohort. Results: The mean ± standard deviation difference in SYNTAX score was 2.1 ± 7.6. The respective weighted kappa values for the number of lesions, bifurcation lesions, ostial lesions, and total occlusions were 0.62, 0.36, 0.66, and 0.91 compared with 0.59, 0.41, 0.63, and 0.82 in the previous core lab assessment. The weighted kappa for the intra-observer reproducibility of the SYNTAX score grouped into deciles was 0.54, and according to the terciles ≤22, >22–≤32, >32 was 0.51 both indicating a moderate level of agreement beyond the level of chance. In the previous assessment, the comparative kappa values were 0.45 and 0.53. Conclusions: The SYNTAX score has moderate intra-observer reproducibility when assessed by a team of three interventional cardiologists, which is consistent with a prior evaluation performed by core lab analysts. The scoring of bifurcation lesions remains the main source of inconsistency. © 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",WOS:000277396200029,CATHETERIZATION AND CARDIOVASCULAR INTERVENTIONS

Until now, numerous variable selection methods have been proposed, but a proper choice among them is not trivial. Furthermore, in many cases, a set of variables found by those methods might not be robust due to the irreproducibility and uncertainty issues, posing a great challenge in improving the reliability of the variable selection. In this study, the reproducibility of the 5 variable selection methods was investigated quantitatively for evaluating their performance. The reproducibility of variable selection was quantified by using Monte-Carlo sub-sampling (MCS) techniques together with the quantitative similarity measure designed for the highly collinear spectral dataset. The investigation of reproducibility and prediction accuracy of the several variable selection algorithms with two different near-infrared (NIR) datasets illustrated that the different variable selection methods exhibited wide variability in their performance, especially in their capabilities to identify the consistent subset of variables from the spectral datasets. Thus the thorough assessment of the reproducibility together with the predictive accuracy of the identified variables improved the statistical validity and confidence of the selection outcome, which cannot be addressed by the conventional evaluation schemes.",WOS:000312514800002,ANALYTICA CHIMICA ACTA

According to CISPR-25 standard (ALSE method), an expensive anechoic chamber is needed for conducting the field emission testing. Reproducibility due to high sensitivity to chamber and setup details is poor. Alternative methods, which perform measurements without using a chamber are preferred. This paper provides an alternative pre-compliance method for predicting the fields of CISPR-25 results for frequencies below 30 MHz, based mainly on electric near-field measurements. The motivation is that common-mode current measurements or magnetic near-field measurement based methods give good field prediction above 30 MHz, but fail below 30 MHz. The proposed method applies Huygens' Principle for field prediction. The electric field distribution for the defined Huygens' surface and the equivalent currents are estimated from a small number of field measurements close to the ground plane. It is shown that the electric field can be well predicted, compared with a full-wave simulation the deviation is within 4 dB, compared with a standard antenna measurement up to 3 MHz the deviation is less than 1 dB.","",""

Funders have been particularly active in demanding change. Although they vary in the degree of openness required and in their interpretation of what a more open approach actually constitutes, there is now a near consensus that at the very least open access must apply to published research results and some funders increasingly require access to research data as well. In addition to funder requirements, other drivers of increasing openness include calls from a variety of stakeholders including researchers themselves for more transparency and less duplication in research.

It is too early to give a definitive answer to the question posed in the title to this chapter. But asking the question at this time is a useful exercise as it encourages us to reflect on the current situation and to begin to analyze current trends, drivers and enablers related to open science based collaboration as well as obstacles and tensions associated with open and global access to science. This chapter endeavours to begin that work and to identify some of the policy challenges associated with moves towards more open science. The chapter is structured around a number of sub-questions to the title’s overall question and concludes with some reflections on the implications for policy-making.","",""

The former topic drives attention on academics’ new practices in digital, open and networked contexts; the second is focused on the requirements and strategies to promote academics’ professional learning and career advancement. The research question addressing this study is: are faculty development strategies hindered by the lack of a cohesive view in the research on digital scholarship? The main assumption guiding this research question is that clear conceptual frameworks and models of professional practice lead to effective faculty development strategies. Through a wide overview of the evolution of both digital scholarship and faculty development, followed by a conceptual analysis of the intersections between fields, the paper attempts to show the extent on which the situation in one area (digital scholarship) might encompass criticalities for the other (faculty development) in terms of research and practices. Furthermore, three scenarios based on the several perspectives of digital scholarship are built in order to explore the research question in depth. We conclude that at the current state of art the relationship between these two topics is weak. Moreover, the dialogue between digital scholarship and faculty development could put the basis to forge effective professional learning contexts and instruments, with the ultimate goal of supporting academics to become digital scholars towards a more open and democratic vision of scholarship.",WOS:000411112400001,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION

Recently an automated single sweep three-dimensional ultrasound (3D US) technique became available. The aims of this study were to evaluate the feasibility and reproducibility of the automated single sweep method in a cohort of patients undergoing clinically indicated carotid ultrasound. Methods: Consecutive patients with a history of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and having a plaque in the internal carotid artery (ICA) were recruited for this study. Imaging was performed using a Philips iU 22 ultrasound system equipped with the single sweep volumetric transducer vL 13-5. Analysis was performed offline with software provided by the manufacturer. Two independent observers performed all measurements. Results: Of 137 arteries studied (from 79 patients), plaque and artery volumes could be measured in 106 (77%). Reproducibility of plaque volume measurements was assessed in 82 arteries. BlandeAltman analysis demonstrated good inter-observer reproducibility with limits of agreement � 0.06 to þ0.07 ml.

Objective: Evaluating the reproducibility and validity of the Abbreviated Scale of Development and determining the frequency of abnormal child development in an area of Medellin-Colombia.
Methods: A transversal study and psychometric evaluation of 141 children less than 5 years of age were performed with the Abbreviated Scale of Development. The description was performed using a summary of measurements and frequencies. Reliability was determined with Cronbach’s α and internal consistency and discriminating power with Spearman’s correlations. Content validity and predictive validity were calculated through exploratory factor analysis. The degree of child development was compared based on gender and age group using the chi-square test.
Results: The 4 dimensions of child development showed the following: Cronbach’s α higher than 0.85; greater than 90% of success in internal consistency and discriminating power; 100% success in the content validity for Gross and Fine Motor Skills; and explained variance of 52.3%. The frequency of children at the Alert level was 15.6% for the Listening and Language and Personal-Social dimensions and approximately 8% for Motor Skills.
Conclusion: The excellent reproducibility and validity are evidence of the availability of a scale for screening child development in Medellin. The high frequency of children with a Medium or Alert level of psycho-social and motor skills development corroborates the need to improve clinical interventions, public health and education policy for this group.","",""

Journal coordinated peer reviewing, a hallmark of scholarly publishing, is also a pivotal part of other central academic processes, such as evaluation of research grant applications, and ranking of applicants for faculty/research positions. Hence, journal coordinated peer reviewing may be viewed as “the mother of academic peer reviewing”. On this background, it is astonishing that universities and other public RD iii) better control of how scientific staff use their time for the good of the university; iv) managing a unified policy shaping of peer reviewing, reducing fraud and flaws. This will in turn increase quality of the research produced by the universities.     The EU has recently announced their goal of making all European scientific articles freely accessible by 2020. This announcement was made unanimously by the EU ministers responsible for research and innovation. The ministers have not announced what means to use in achieving their announced goal. We suggest a united approach whereby taking control of the peer review job could be an interesting road to follow. Such a unified international action among universities and grant agencies would be very beneficial in order to make the changes needed to establish peer reviewing as a truly academically based responsibility. The increasing international agreements and actions to implement open access publishing are indications that such changes are possible. By standing together universities will be able to break the economic grip that the big commercial publishing houses have on academic research. Some may argue that it is the right of each individual scientist to decide on the extent and for what journal to perform peer reviewing. However, if an employer for some reason limits the amount of time used to do peer reviewing for certain commercial publishing houses, it would not interfere with the academic freedom to do research and to choose freely where and how to publish. After all, work contracts include instructions on how to perform a certain amount of teaching, administration and research. The option of directing where to do or not to do peer review should not be very controversial. By taking control of and organizing peer reviewing universities would obtain a means to regain the academic freedom that was lost when commercial enterprises took over the society driven journals, introducing heavy paywalls. And it may facilitate a development towards an open science regime.","",""

We present data from a motor task with three conditions, sequential and random finger tapping and rest. Similar activation maps were obtained for each site and visit; brain areas consistently activated during the task included the premotor, primary motor and supplementary motor areas, the striatum and cerebellum. Reproducibility was evaluated within and between sites by comparing the extent and spatial agreement of activation maps at both the subject and group levels. The results were within the range previously reported for similar tasks on single scanners and both measures were found to be comparable within and between sites, with between site reproducibility similar to the within site measures. A variance components analysis was used to examine the effects of site, subject and visit. The contributions of site and visit were small and reproducibility was similar between and within sites, whereas the variance between subjects, and unexplained variance was large.

However, this process is frequently required in research and quality assurance contexts. The purpose of this study was to examine inter-rater reproducibility (agreement and reliability) among an inexperienced group of clinicians in extracting spinal pathoanatomic information from radiologist-generated MRI narrative reports. Methods: Twenty MRI narrative reports were randomly extracted from an institutional database. A group of three physiotherapy students independently reviewed the reports and coded the presence of 14 common pathoanatomic findings using a categorical electronic coding matrix. Decision rules were developed after initial coding in an effort to resolve ambiguities in narrative reports. This process was repeated a further three times using separate samples of 20 MRI reports until no further ambiguities were identified (total n = 80). Reproducibility between trainee clinicians and two highly trained raters was examined in an arbitrary coding round, with agreement measured using percentage agreement and reliability measured using unweighted Kappa (k). Reproducibility was then examined in another group of three trainee clinicians who had not participated in the production of the decision rules, using another sample of 20 MRI reports. Results: The mean percentage agreement for paired comparisons between the initial trainee clinicians improved over the four coding rounds (97.9-99.4%), although the greatest improvement was observed after the first",WOS:000210279200001,CHIROPRACTIC & MANUAL THERAPIES

To evaluate the effect of fMRI localization approaches and region size on the reproducibility of digit localization in the human somatosensory cortex.



Materials and Methods:

Vibrotactile stimulation was applied to digits 2 and 4 producing cortical activation sites relating to each digit. Thirteen subjects were scanned twice on separate occasions in a 3 Tesla scanner using a voxel size of 2 mm. Regions of activity were thresholded to different sizes varying from 50 to 1000 voxels. Three measures of position were acquired from these regions: center of gravity (COG), center co-ordinate and peak voxel. To account for registration errors, Euclidean distance between the two digits was computed. Reproducibility was determined in terms of the 95% confidence interval for individual position in X, Y, and Z and also the distance between the two digit locations.



Results:

Region size of 200 most significant voxels was shown to have the best reproducibility. Center co-ordinate proved to be the most precise form of localizing activity with a 95% CI of 2.1 mm, 2.6 mm, and 3.1 mm in the X, Y, and Z axes. Euclidean distance between the center co-ordinates of the two digit activation sites was shown to be a reliable means of overcoming registration errors with a 95% CI of 1.7 mm.

Materials and Methods: CBCT scans were obtained from 50 patients of a private clinic. Two examiners located the landmarks twice in two-dimensional and three-dimensional images on different days, with images performed 1 week apart. Intra- and interexaminer reproducibility and reliability were analyzed. Results: the measurement error (ME) did not show significant differences between intra- and interexaminers. The intraclass correlations (ICC) between the intra- and interexaminer readings obtained with the different methods showed almost perfect matches. The results demonstrated high examiner reproducibility for linear and volumetric parameters with high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and coefficient of variation (CV). The ICC showed that the methodology was highly reliable and reproducible (ICC- >0.99 and CV Conclusion: the measurements demonstrated strong agreement between examiners and significant reliability and reproducibility. Therefore, this methodology can serve as a standard for linear measurement analysis of the topography of mandibular canal and osseous adjacent structures.","",""

Design Reliability analysis. Methods Two consecutive enhanced depth imaging optical coherence tomography (EDI-OCT) scans were obtained at a single clinic visit for 97 uveitic eyes from patients ≥16 years of age with noninfectious anterior (n = 10), intermediate (n = 11), posterior (n = 26), and panuveitis (n = 13) at the National Eye Institute. SFCT was manually measured by 2 ophthalmologists using manufacturer's software. Intravisit and interobserver reproducibility of SFCT measurements were assessed by using the Bland-Altman method to determine the estimate of bias (mean difference in SFCT measurements), 95% limits of agreement, and coefficients of repeatability. The reproducibility of these measurements was also compared between groups by anatomic location and clinical activity. Results Of 97 eyes, 65 (67.0%) were clinically quiet, 18 (18.6%) were minimally active, and 14 (14.4%) were active at the time the scans were obtained. Manual SFCT measurements were reproducible within 32.4 ± 3.8 μm between sessions for the same observer and 51.4 ± 8.5 μm between observers for the same session. Coefficients of repeatability did not differ significantly by anatomic location or disease activity. Conclusions Manual SFCT measurements obtained by EDI-OCT are reproducible in uveitis patients, with coefficients of repeatability that are nearly comparable to those published for normal eyes. This study provides guidance for using manual SFCT measurements in clinical practice, but further studies are still needed to determine their utility in clinical trials.",WOS:000373657300008,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY

The traditional way of publishing new findings in journals is becoming increasingly outdated and no longer serves the needs of much of science. Whilst preprints can bring significant benefits of removing delay and selection, they do not go far enough if simply implemented alongside the existing journal system. We propose that we need a new approach, an Open Science Platform, that takes the benefits of preprints but adds formal, invited, and transparent post-publication peer review. This bypasses the problems of the current journal system and, in doing so, moves the evaluation of research and researchers away from the journal-based Impact Factor and towards a fairer system of article-based qualitative and quantitative indicators. In the long term, it should be irrelevant where a researcher publishes their findings. What is important is that research is shared and made available without delay within a framework that encourages quality standards and requires all players in the research community to work as collaborators.","",""

Study design Five examiners, with different levels of experience and blinded to each other, evaluated 100 stored 3D volumes from adnexal masses and looked for the presence or absence of malignant or benign features according to the IOTA definitions. Multiplanar view and virtual navigation were used. All examiners had to assess the 3D volume of each adnexal mass and classify it as benign or malignant. To analyze intra-observer agreement each examiner performed the assessment twice with a two-week interval between the first and second assessments. To analyze the inter-observer agreement, the second assessment from each examiner was used. Reproducibility was assessed calculating the weighted Kappa index. Results Intra-observer reproducibility was moderate or good for all observers (Kappa index ranging from 0.59 to 0.74). Inter-observer reproducibility was moderate to good (Kappa index range: 0.46–0.67).

Our aim was to estimate intraobserver, interobserver, and interstudy reproducibility of renal volume measurement in subjects without known kidney disease using magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. Materials and methods We studied 20 patients (age range 33–82 years) without known renal disease using 1.5-T MR imaging with a respiratory-gated two-dimensional coronal balanced steady state free precession sequence. Each patient repeated the study after 1h. Two readers independently segmented the area of both kidneys of the first study, subtracting cysts. After 1 week, the first reader segmented the second study and repeated the segmentation of the first study. The volume of each kidney was obtained by multiplying the renal area on each slice by the slice thickness and summing all the partial volumes. Reproducibility was assessed by Bland-Altman and Wilcoxon statistics. The coefficient of repeatability (CoR) was summed to the absolute value of bias; the ratio between this sum and the mean of the two data sets was used as a measure of variability while its complement to 100% was used as a measure of reproducibility. Results Acquisition time was 2–3min. Segmentation time was 20–25min. Intraobserver variability results in a CoR of 7ml and in a reproducibility of 95%, interobserver variability 8.8–9.8ml and 87–88%, interstudy variability 9.8–10.6ml and 91–93%, respectively. Considering both the effect of observer and the repetition of the study, the reproducibility was 83–87%.

It has been suggested that expert outlining yields poorer reproducibility as compared to automated methods, but this has not been investigated. Aim: To determine the reproducibilities of expert manual outlining and two common automated methods for measuring hippocampal atrophy rates in healthy aging, MCI and AD. Methods: From the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), 80 subjects were selected: 20 patients with AD, 40 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 20 healthy controls (HCs). Left and right hippocampal volume change between baseline and month-12 visit was assessed by using expert manual delineation, and by the automated software packages FreeSurfer (longitudinal processing stream) and FIRST. To assess reproducibility of the measured hippocampal volume change, both back-to-back (BTB) MPRAGE scans available for each visit were analyzed. Hippocampal volume change was expressed in μL, and as a percentage of baseline volume. Reproducibility of the 1-year hippocampal volume change was estimated from the BTB measurements by using linear mixed model to calculate the limits of agreement (LoA) of each method, reflecting its measurement uncertainty. Using the delta method, approximate p-values were calculated for the pairwise comparisons between methods. Statistical analyses were performed both with inclusion and exclusion of visibly incorrect segmentations. Results: Visibly incorrect automated segmentation in either one or both scans of a longitudinal scan pair occurred in 7.5% of the hippocampi for FreeSurfer and in 6.9% of the hippocampi for FIRST. After excluding these failed cases, reproducibility analysis for 1-year percentage volume change yielded LoA of ±. 7.2% for FreeSurfer, ±. 9.7% for expert manual delineation, and ±. 10.0% for FIRST. Methods ranked the same for reproducibility of 1-year. μL volume change, with LoA of ±. 218. μL for FreeSurfer, ±. 319. μL for expert manual delineation, and ±. 333. μL for FIRST. Approximate p-values indicated that reproducibility was better for FreeSurfer than for manual or FIRST, and that manual and FIRST did not differ. Inclusion of failed automated segmentations led to worsening of reproducibility of both automated methods for 1-year raw and percentage volume change. Conclusion: Quantitative reproducibility values of 1-year microliter and percentage hippocampal volume change were roughly similar between expert manual outlining, FIRST and FreeSurfer, but FreeSurfer reproducibility was statistically significantly superior to both manual outlining and FIRST after exclusion of failed segmentations. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",WOS:000335713000017,NEUROIMAGE

Carotid atherosclerotic plaques were used to test reproducibility. Methods: 50 atherosclerotic plaques that were obtained during carotid endarterectomy were analysed. For the semiquantitative analysis, 6 different plaque characteristics were scored in categories by two independent observers, and Cohen’s k was used to test intra- and interobserver reproducibility. The computer-aided method (assessed by two independent observers) and automated method were tested on CD68 (for macrophages) and a smooth muscle actin (for smooth muscle cells) stainings. Agreement for these two methods (done on a continuous scale) was assessed by intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs). Results: For the semiquantitative analysis, k values ranged from 0.55 to 0.69 for interobserver variability, and were slightly higher for intraobserver reproducibility in both observers.

Although the Ki-67 LI is used in treatment decision making, its reproducibility shows variation in different studies, and is generally less then optimal. The aim of the present study was to investigate how the use of a standardized, partially digitalized counting method could affect reproducibility of determining the Ki-67 LI. Thirty breast cancer core-biopsy samples were stained with B-56, SP-6 and MIB-1 monoclonal Ki-67 antibodies. Each sample was represented by a single digital photograph taken with a x20 objective. Four investigators determined the Ki-67 LI on these digital images by estimation, then by counting with the help of a grid overlaid on the same images. Altogether 720 evaluations were made by 4 independent pathologists. Good to excellent correlation was found between estimations and calculations of each observer. Kappa values >0.6 suggest substantial inter-observer agreement when classifying the cases into a 15 % and 30 % cut-off determined three-tiered or a 4-quarter-based four-tiered categorization, which is better than the fair reproducibility gained on the real slides in a previous study. The results also suggest that the type of the antibody may also impact on the consistency of both estimating and calculating the Ki-67 LIs. The results indicate that counting on digital images may significantly improve reproducibility of determining the KI-67 LI. Interestingly, estimation on the same images is not worse, but is obviously faster and more convenient.",WOS:000334283400022,PATHOLOGY & ONCOLOGY RESEARCH

Measures of reproducibility are dependent on the frequency and distribution of the event. The aim of this study was to compare 2 reproducibility measures, reliability and agreement, in VFA readings in both a population-based and a clinical cohort. We measured agreement and reliability by uniform kappa and Cohen's kappa for vertebral reading and fracture identification: 360 VFAs from a population-based cohort and 85 from a clinical cohort. In the population-based cohort, 12% of vertebrae were unreadable. Vertebral fracture prevalence ranged from 3% to 4%. Inter-reader and intrareader reliability with Cohen's kappa was fair to good (0.35–0.71 and 0.36–0.74, respectively), with good inter-reader and intrareader agreement by uniform kappa (0.74–0.98 and 0.76–0.99, respectively). In the clinical cohort, 15% of vertebrae were unreadable, and vertebral fracture prevalence ranged from 7.6% to 8.1%. Inter-reader reliability was moderate to good (0.43–0.71), and the agreement was good (0.68–0.91). In clinical situations, the levels of reproducibility measured by the 2 kappa statistics are concordant, so that either could be used to measure agreement and reliability. However, if events are rare, as in a population-based cohort, we recommend evaluating reproducibility using the uniform kappa, as Cohen's kappa may be less accurate.",WOS:000354667800017,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL DENSITOMETRY

Huge scientific and technological gains should have increased the quality of academic science and raised industrial RD inflation-adjusted industrial RD and drugs are more likely to fail in clinical development today than in the 1970s. The contrast is explicable only if powerful headwinds reversed the gains and/or if many \"gains\" have proved illusory. However, discussions of reproducibility and RD and (b) identify factors to which R&D efficiency is sensitive. We present a quantitative decision-theoretic model of the R&D process. The model represents therapeutic candidates (e.g., putative drug targets, molecules in a screening library, etc.) within a “measurement space\", with candidates' positions determined by their performance on a variety of assays (e.g., binding affinity, toxicity, in vivo efficacy, etc.) whose results correlate to a greater or lesser degree. We apply decision rules to segment the space, and assess the probability of correct R&D decisions. We find that when searching for rare positives (e.g., candidates that will successfully complete clinical development), changes in the predictive validity of screening and disease models that many people working in drug discovery would regard as small and/or unknowable (i.e., an 0.1 absolute change in correlation coefficient between model output and clinical outcomes in man) can offset large (e.g., 10 fold, even 100 fold) changes in models’ brute-force efficiency. We also show how validity and reproducibility correlate across a population of simulated screening and disease models. We hypothesize that screening and disease models with high predictive validity are more likely to yield good answers and good treatments, so tend to render themselves and their diseases academically and commercially redundant. Perhaps there has also been too much enthusiasm for reductionist molecular models which have insufficient predictive validity. Thus we hypothesize that the average predictive validity of the stock of academically and industrially \"interesting\" screening and disease models has declined over time, with even small falls able to offset large gains in scientific knowledge and brute-force efficiency. The rate of creation of valid screening and disease models may be the major constraint on R&D productivity.",WOS:000370046600020,PLOS ONE

The variability of nuchal translucency thickness (NT) measurements in the first trimester appears to be associated in part with caliper placement. Methods for obtaining semi-automated adjusted measurements (SAAMs) can provide several NT values (maximum, minimum, mean and median) automatically within a manually set frame in the zone of interest. This study sought to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of these SAAM-NTs.



Methods

Three readers, two experts and one less experienced, examined archive images of 160 patients and obtained SAAM-NTs from them, on two separate occasions. The intra- and interobserver reproducibility were assessed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for maximum, mean and median SAAM-NTs, and Bland–Altman plots were constructed.



Results

SAAM-NTs were technically feasible for all 160 images. The range of ICCs for intraobserver reproducibility was 0.76–0.93 for mean SAAM-NT, 0.76–0.95 for median SAAM-NT and 0.74–0.95 for maximum SAAM-NT. Interobserver ICCs were 0.85, 0.85 and 0.84 for mean SAAM-NT, median SAAM-NT and maximum SAAM-NT, respectively. There were no significant differences for intra- and interobserver reproducibility of median, mean and maximum SAAM-NTs.



Conclusions

SAAM-NT is feasible with a high level of intra- and interobserver reproducibility. This easy-to-use method has the potential to simplify screening during the first trimester. It should be evaluated further and compared with the manual measurement method. Copyright © 2011 ISUOG. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",WOS:000287606600014,ULTRASOUND IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY

To assess the reproducibility of Naranjo Adverse Drug Reaction Probability Scale (APS) scores in published case reports.

Design
Reliability analysis.

Measurements and Main Results
Randomly selected case reports using the APS were identified from the Web of Science database. The APS scores were blinded from the case reports, and scores were then independently calculated by four raters, using the APS. The percentage of exact agreement between raters' and the published APS scores was calculated for all case reports. Categorical scores were compared by using a weighted κ statistic. For numerical scores, descriptive statistics were computed by using raw and absolute difference scores. Twenty-four case reports were independently scored by four raters. Exact agreement between all raters' scores and the published APS scores was found in five (21%) of the 24 reports. Agreement between individual rater's scores and the published categorical score ranged from 42% to 79%. Weighted κ ranged from 0.12 to 0.61, corresponding to strengths of agreement between poor and good. Difference in scoring by raters resulted in 18% and 27% of case reports being reclassified into higher and lower than reported APS categories, respectively.

Conclusion
Exact agreement between raters' scores and the published APS score was infrequent. We recommend that authors of case reports include all pertinent details of the case and that journals ensure the robustness of the causality assessment during peer review.",WOS:000344927500008,PHARMACOTHERAPY

There is very limited knowledge about how across-session reliability of morphometry estimates might be affected by different 3 T MRI systems. Moreover, there is a need for optimal acquisition and analysis protocols in order to reduce sample sizes. A recent study has shown that the longitudinal FreeSurfer segmentation offers improved within session test–retest reproducibility relative to the cross-sectional segmentation at one 3 T site using a nonstandard multi-echo MPRAGE sequence. In this study we implement a multi-site 3 T MRI morphometry protocol based on vendor provided T1 structural sequences from different vendors (3D MPRAGE on Siemens and Philips, 3D IR-SPGR on GE) implemented in 8 sites located in 4 European countries. The protocols used mild acceleration factors (1.5–2) when possible. We acquired across-session test–retest structural data of a group of healthy elderly subjects (5 subjects per site) and compared the across-session reproducibility of two full-brain automated segmentation methods based on either longitudinal or cross-sectional FreeSurfer processing. The segmentations include cortical thickness, intracranial, ventricle and subcortical volumes. Reproducibility is evaluated as absolute changes relative to the mean (%), Dice coefficient for volume overlap and intraclass correlation coefficients across two sessions. We found that this acquisition and analysis protocol gives comparable reproducibility results to previous studies that used longer acquisitions without acceleration. We also show that the longitudinal processing is systematically more reliable across sites regardless of MRI system differences. The reproducibility errors of the longitudinal segmentations are on average approximately half of those obtained with the cross sectional analysis for all volume segmentations and for entorhinal cortical thickness. No significant differences in reliability are found between the segmentation methods for the other cortical thickness estimates. The average of two MPRAGE volumes acquired within each test–retest session did not systematically improve the across-session reproducibility of morphometry estimates. Our results extend those from previous studies that showed improved reliability of the longitudinal analysis at single sites and/or with non-standard acquisition methods. The multi-site acquisition and analysis protocol presented here is promising for clinical applications since it allows for smaller sample sizes per MRI site or shorter trials in studies evaluating the role of potential biomarkers to predict disease progression or treatment effects.",WOS:000326953700043,NEUROIMAGE

We have sought to evaluate the reproducibility over time of isokinetic testing of the hip flexor (FI) and extensor (Ext) muscles and to establish whether there is a significant difference in peak torque (PT) between the left and right hips. Patients and methods Ten adults were tested once a week for 3 weeks by the same investigator and according to the same protocol, with two velocities (60°/s and 180°/s) for the hip FI and Ext in concentric tests and one velocity (30°/s) for the Ext only in eccentric tests. The reproducibility of the measured PT was analyzed by using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and a Bland and Altman plot. The difference in PT between the right and left hips was tested using Student's T test. Results The ICC for the observed PT values revealed very good reproducibility (with a value of between 0.75 and 0.96) for the hip FI and Ext measurements (regardless of the body side, test velocity or contraction mode). We did not observe any significant PT differences between the right and left hips. Conclusion The isokinetic assessment of the concentric and eccentric PT values generated by the hip FI and Ext is highly reproducible. There is no difference between dominant and nondominant body sides, which enables the use of the contralateral limb as a reference.","",""

We tested latent print examiners on the extent to which they reached consistent decisions. This study assessed intra-examiner repeatability by retesting 72 examiners on comparisons of latent and exemplar fingerprints, after an interval of approximately seven months; each examiner was reassigned 25 image pairs for comparison, out of total pool of 744 image pairs. We compare these repeatability results with reproducibility (inter-examiner) results derived from our previous study. Examiners repeated 89.1% of their individualization decisions, and 90.1% of their exclusion decisions; most of the changed decisions resulted in inconclusive decisions. Repeatability of comparison decisions (individualization, exclusion, inconclusive) was 90.0% for mated pairs, and 85.9% for nonmated pairs. Repeatability and reproducibility were notably lower for comparisons assessed by the examiners as ‘‘difficult’’ than for ‘‘easy’’ or ‘‘moderate’’ comparisons, indicating that examiners’ assessments of difficulty may be useful for quality assurance. No false positive errors were repeated (n=4); 30% of false negative errors were repeated. One percent of latent value decisions were completely reversed (no value even for exclusion vs. of value for individualization). Most of the inter- and intra-examiner variability concerned whether the examiners considered the information available to be sufficient to reach a conclusion; this variability was concentrated on specific image pairs such that repeatability and reproducibility were very high on some comparisons and very low on others. Much of the variability appears to be due to making categorical decisions in borderline cases.",WOS:000302381500049,PLOS ONE

Thirty-four children aged 7–17 years participated in intra-rater and inter-rater evaluation, and 22 children repeated assessment six weeks later for evaluation of test-retest reliability. Postural control was assessed using the Full Balance Evaluation Systems Test (Full-BESTest) and the short-form Mini-BESTest. Intra-rater, inter-rater and test-retest reproducibility were examined using video assessment. Test-retest reproducibility was also assessed in real-time. Reproducibility was examined by agreement and reliability statistics. Agreement was calculated using percentage of agreement, Limits of Agreement and Smallest Detectable Change. Reliability was calculated using Intra-class Correlation Coefficients. Results showed that the reliability of Total Scores was excellent for the Full-BESTest for all conditions (all ICCs > 0.82), whereas the Mini-BESTest ranged from fair to excellent (ICC = 0.56–0.86). Percentage of Domain Scores with good-excellent reliability (ICCs > 0.60) was slightly higher for the Full-BESTest (66%) compared to the Mini-BESTest (59%). Smallest Detectable Change scores were good to excellent for the Full-BESTest (2%–6%) and for the Mini-BESTest (5%–10%) relative to total test scores. Both the Full-BESTest and Mini-BESTest can discriminate postural control abilities within and between days in school-aged children. The Full-BESTest has slightly better reproducibility and a broader range of items, which could be the most useful version for treatment planning. We propose minor modifications to improve reproducibility for children, and indicate the modified version by the title Kids-BESTest.

To assess the repeatability and reproducibility of ocular biometry and intraocular lens (IOL) power measurements obtained by ophthalmology residents using an AL-Scan device, a novel optical biometer. Methods. Two ophthalmology residents were instructed regarding the AL-Scan device. Both performed ocular biometry and IOL power measurements using AL-Scan, three times on each of 128 eyes, independently of one another. Corneal keratometry readings, horizontal iris width, central corneal thickness, anterior chamber depth, pupil size, and axial length values measured by both residents were recorded together with IOL power values calculated on the basis of four different IOL calculation formulas (SRK/T, Holladay, and HofferQ). Repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements obtained were analyzed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Results. Repeatability (ICC, 0.872-0.999 for resident 1 versus 0.905-0.999 for resident 2) and reproducibility (ICC, 0.916-0.999) were high for all biometric measurements. Repeatability (ICC, 0.981-0.983 for resident 1 versus 0.995-0.996 for resident 2) and reproducibility were also high for all IOL power measurements (ICC, 0.996 for all). Conclusions.

Consideration of the efficacy of this approach motivates the introduction of a probabilistic measure, for whether a classifier showing promising results in a small-sample preliminary study will perform similarly on a large independent sample. Given the error estimate from the preliminary study, if the probability of reproducible error is low, then there is really no purpose in substantially allocating more resources to a large follow-on study. Indeed, if the probability of the preliminary study providing likely reproducible results is small, then why even perform the preliminary study?

Results: This article introduces a reproducibility index for classification, measuring the probability that a sufficiently small error estimate on a small sample will motivate a large follow-on study. We provide a simulation study based on synthetic distribution models that possess known intrinsic classification difficulties and emulate real-world scenarios. We also set up similar simulations on four real datasets to show the consistency of results. The reproducibility indices for different distributional models, real datasets and classification schemes are empirically calculated. The effects of reporting and multiple-rule biases on the reproducibility index are also analyzed.

Availability: We have implemented in C code the synthetic data distribution model, classification rules, feature selection routine and error estimation methods.

In this paper we introduce _Popper_, a convention based on a set of modern open source software (OSS) development principles for generating reproducible scientific publications. Concretely, we make the case for treating an article as an OSS project following a DevOps approach and applying software engineering best-practices to manage its associated artifacts and maintain the reproducibility of its findings. Popper leverages existing cloud-computing infrastructure and DevOps tools to produce academic articles that are easy to validate and extend. We present a use case that illustrates the usefulness of this approach. We show how, by following the _Popper_ convention, reviewers and researchers can quickly get to the point of getting results without relying on the original author's intervention.","",""

For comparison purposes samples after typical finishing operations were selected, i.e. after honing, grinding or super finish. Several measurement standards were used as well. The project proved that measurements of roughness provide different results and requires further work to find good explanations and reasons of these differences. This would help to improve analysis of surfaces and eliminate discrepancies of roughness measurements.

We examine how these principles apply to the release and disclosure of the four elements associated with computer science research: theory, algorithms, code, and data. Reproducibility refers to the capability to reproduce fundamental results from released details. Correctness refers to the ability of an independent reviewer to verify and validate the results of a paper. We introduce the new term buildability to indicate the ability of other researchers to use the published research as a foundation for their own new work. This is more broad than extensibility, as it requires that the published results have reached a level of completeness that the research can be used for its stated purpose, and has progressed beyond the level of a preliminary idea. We argue that these three principles are not being sufficiently met by current publications and proposals in computer science and engineering, and represent a goal for which publishing should continue to aim. We introduce standards for the evaluation of reproducibility, correctness, and buildability in relation to the varied elements of computer science research and discuss how they apply to proposals, workshops, conferences, and journal publications, making arguments for appropriate standards of each principle in these settings. We address modern issues including big data, data confidentiality, privacy, security, and privilege. Our examination raises questions for discussion in the community on the appropriateness of publishing works that fail to meet one, some, or all of the stated principles.","",""

This discussion is also closely aligned with the need to identify sustainable ways to expand the national research enterprise and to generate actionable results that can be applied to improve the nation’s health. The principles and practices of Open Science offer a promising path to address both goals by facilitating (1) increased transparency of data and methods, which promotes research reproducibility and rigor; and (2) cumulative efficiencies wherein research tools and the output of research are combined to accelerate the delivery of new knowledge in proximal domains, thereby resulting in greater productivity and a reduction in redundant research investments. Objectives: AcademyHealth’s Electronic Data Methods (EDM) Forum implemented a proof-of-concept open science platform for health research called the Collaborative Informatics Environment for Learning on Health Outcomes (CIELO). Methods: The EDM Forum conducted a user-centered design process to elucidate important and high-level requirements for creating and sustaining an open science paradigm. Results: By implementing CIELO and engaging a variety of potential users in its public beta testing, the EDM Forum has been able to elucidate a broad range of stakeholder needs and requirements related to the use of an open science platform focused on health research in a variety of “real world” settings. Conclusions: Our initial design and development experience over the course of the CIELO project has provided the basis for a vigorous dialogue between stakeholder community members regarding the capabilities that will add the greatest value to an open science platform for the health research community. A number of important questions around user incentives, sustainability, and scalability will require further community dialogue and agreement.

Additional evidence from larger meta‐analysis of past papers also points to a lack of reproducibility in biomedical research with potentially dire consequences for drug development and investment into research. One of the largest meta‐analyses concluded that low levels of reproducibility, at best around 50% of all preclinical biomedical research, were delaying lifesaving therapies, increasing pressure on research budgets and raising costs of drug development [1]. The paper claimed that about US$28 billion a year was spent largely fruitlessly on preclinical research in the USA alone.

### A problem of statistics

However, the assertion that a 50% level of reproducibility equates to a crisis, or that many of the original studies were really fruitless, has been disputed by some specialists in replication. “A 50% level of reproducibility is generally reported as being bad, but that is a complete misconstrual of what to expect”, commented Jeffrey Mogil, who holds the Canada Research Chair in Genetics of Pain at McGill University in Montreal. “There is no way you could expect 100% reproducibility, and if you did, then the studies could not have been very good in the first place. If people could replicate published studies all the time then they could not have been cutting edge and pushing the boundaries”.

One reason not to expect 100% reproducibility in preclinical studies is that cutting edge or exploratory research deals with a lot of uncertainty and competing hypotheses of which only a few can be correct. After all, there would be no need to conduct experiments at all if the outcome were completely predictable.

Researchers report their findings, which are strengthened as other independent groups in the scientific community share similar outcomes. In the many scientific fields where software has become a fundamental tool for capturing and analyzing data, this requirement of reproducibility implies that reliable and comprehensive software platforms and tools should be made available to the scientific community. The tools will empower them and the public to verify, through practice, the reproducibility of observations that are reported in the scientific literature.Medical image analysis is one of the fields in which the use of computational resources, both software and hardware, are an essential platform for performing experimental work. In this arena, the introduction of the Insight Toolkit (ITK) in 1999 has transformed the field and facilitates its progress by accelerating the rate at which algorithmic implementations are developed, tested, disseminated and improved. By building on the efficiency and quality of open source methodologies, ITK has provided the medical image community with an effective platform on which to build a daily workflow that incorporates the true scientific practices of reproducibility verification.This article describes the multiple tools, methodologies, and practices that the ITK community has adopted, refined, and followed during the past decade, in order to become one of the research communities with the most modern reproducibility verification infrastructure. For example, 207 contributors have created over 2400 unit tests that provide over 84% code line test coverage. The Insight Journal, an open publication journal associated with the toolkit, has seen over 360,000 publication downloads.

Women were examined during ovulation phase (12–14 day) of the menstrual cycle in all the cases. Intraindividual variability of each of 13 QST parameters was assessed and compared between particular tests. Results All the QST parameters showed good short-term reproducibility over a period of 4 months.The highest reproducibility was found for vibration detection thresholds, the lowest for mechanical pain sensitivity. In general, sensory thresholds (e.g. cold/warm detection threshold,vibration or mechanical detection threshold) demonstrated higher reproducibility in comparison with pain thresholds (e.g. cold/warm pain thresholds, mechanical or pressure pain threshold). Conclusion All the QST parameters proved acceptable reproducibility and can by used for the evaluation of clinical status changes in the long-term follow-up.","",""

It is highly desirable to have a measurement process that is both accurate and precise. Because of the complexity of the measurement, there are many potential factors that could affect the precision of the measurement. For example, when taking probed measurements, operators typically use different methods to align the probes, which often introduce subtle variations in measurements. Additionally calibration algorithms (or procedures) may have slight differences that introduce errors as well. This paper will present a method to identify the largest sources of variation that impact the precision of the measurement.

Probands and Methods: We examined the reproducibility of 22 landmarks on six three-dimensional facial scans of 4- to 6-yearold randomly-selected kindergarten children. The 3D scans were taken by the digital system faceSCAN II® under standardized conditions. One specially-trained investigator marked all landmarks on each of the six 3D scans a total of ten times. Ten different orthodontic residents also placed all landmarks on each of these scans. Standard deviations from the mean were then calculated from the data for each individual landmark on the x-, y- and z-axes. Results: The specially-trained investigator who had placed all landmarks on each of the six 3D scans a total of ten times found 15 of 22 landmarks to be reproducible well to within a standard deviation of less than 1 mm on each spatial plane. For the ten orthodontic residents, only three landmarks were found to be reproducible to within a standard deviation of under 1 mm for each spatial plane. Conclusion: Familiarity with 3D facial scans and their corresponding software programs, together with good image quality, improve the reproducibility of the analysis. Landmarks revealing poor reproducibility should be used, if at all, with due caution for analysis.

Standardized bitewing radiographs were obtained from 166 permanent molars. Radiographic examination was performed by final-year dental students from two universities (A, n = 5; B, n = 5) and by dentists with 5 to 7 years of experience who work in two different countries (C, n = 5; D, n = 5). All examinations were repeated after 1-week interval. The teeth were histologically prepared and assessed for caries extension. For intraexaminer reproducibility, the unweighted kappa values were: A (0.11–0.40), B (0.12–0.33), C (0.47–0.58), and D (0.42–0.71). Interexaminer reproducibility statistics were computed based on means ± SD of unweighted kappa values: A (0.07 ± 0.05), B (0.12 ± 0.09), C (0.24 ± 0.08), and D (0.33 ± 0.10). Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated at D1 and D3 thresholds and compared by performing McNemar test (p = 0.05). D1 sensitivity ranged between 0.29 and 0.75 and specificity between 0.24 and 0.85. D3 specificity was moderate to high (between 0.62 and 0.95) for all groups, with statistically significant difference between the dentists groups (C and D). Sensitivity was low to moderate (between 0.21 and 0.57) with statistically significant difference for groups B and D. Accuracy was similar for all groups (0.55). Spearman’s correlations were: A (0.12), B (0.24), C (0.30), and D (0.38).

Reproducibility is essential for science, because the reproducibility of experimental results is a tenet of the scientific method, but reproducibility is also beneficial in many other fields, including automated decision making, visualization, and automated data feeds. To achieve the vision of reproducibility, the workflow-based community has strongly advocated the use of provenance as an underpinning mechanism for reproducibility, since a rich representation of provenance allows steps to be reproduced and all intermediary and final results checked and validated. Concurrently, multiple ontology-based representations of provenance have been devised, to be able to describe past computations, uniformly across a variety of technologies. However, such Semantic Web representations of provenance do not have any formal link with execution. Even assuming a faithful and non-malicious environment, how can we claim that an ontology-based representation of provenance enables reproducibility, since it has not been given any execution semantics, and therefore has no formal way of expressing the reproduction of computations? This is the problem that this paper tackles by defining a denotational semantics for the Open Provenance Model, which is referred to as the reproducibility semantics. This semantics is used to implement a reproducibility service, leveraging multiple Semantic Web technologies, and offering a variety of reproducibility approaches, found in the literature. A series of empirical experiments were designed to exhibit the range of reproducibility capabilities of our approach; in particular, we demonstrate the ability to reproduce computations involving multiple technologies, as is commonly found on the Web.",WOS:000300169300009,JOURNAL OF WEB SEMANTICS

Research efforts in the field of descriptive and predictive Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships or Quantitative Structure–Property Relationships produce around one thousand scientific publications annually. All the materials and results are mainly communicated using printed media. The printed media in its present form have obvious limitations when they come to effectively representing mathematical models, including complex and non-linear, and large bodies of associated numerical chemical data. It is not supportive of secondary information extraction or reuse efforts while in silico studies poses additional requirements for accessibility, transparency and reproducibility of the research. This gap can and should be bridged by introducing domain-specific digital data exchange standards and tools.

Presenter - Frederic Brodkom. The ARES-CCD (formerly CUD) is the French-speaking universities and high-school of Belgium Commission for the Cooperation to Development. With an annual budget of 31 M€ fully dedicated to the academic development of actually 19 universities of North and Central Africa, South-East Asia, Western South America and Greater Antilles, this commission brings together volunteers of the academic, scientific and administrative staffs of our universities. Since 2000, librarians are strongly involved in this project with the aim to develop the partner’s libraries, to improve their infrastructures and operations, to facilitate their access to documentary resources and to strengthen their librarians' skills. Given the important documentary needs of students and researchers in the South and the lack of financial resources, the promotion of Open Science is more than an obvious. We will show that, in addition to our activities of purchasing books or materials, basic training or library renovation, we develop, in close partnership with our colleagues, the Open Science culture in six fields: (1) The installation and support of open-source ILS (mainly KOHA and PMB), including the learning of IT teams (2) The harvesting and promotion of OA resources via our Web Portal, including subscription to official resources of international organization (3) The development of policies to develop local institutional repositories for new and archived (printed) publications and thesis (DSpace support, purchase of scanner, etc) (4) The support to the development of university presses to reduce/abolish the excessive cost of printed course materials for students (5) Training and awareness-raising of library trainers for academic social networks, data exchange platforms, community-based researchers' sites, OA use, etc. (6) Promote the obligation to deposit in our university repositories the scientific papers financed by the ARES-CCD cooperation and co-signed by Belgian researchers and partners of developing countries (academic and doctorate students). Concrete case studies of our 17 years of experience in the South from Haiti to Vietnam will illustrate these actions. Perspectives on future projects will also be discussed, such as a week, jointly with all our partners, of exchange and work in Belgium in 2018 (as already done in 2016) on the topic of the practical implementation of Open Access in their universities.

The repeatability of acoustical testing is usually defined based on repeated testing of the same assembly over a short time period. Other variability, such as rebuilding an assembly in the same lab or building a nominally identical assembly in a different lab, is generally termed reproducibility. A previously undocumented variability is what may be termed “long term repeatability,” the repeated testing of the identical specimen in the same laboratory with the same equipment and operator, but over an extended time period. The authors recently had the opportunity to measure the long term repeatability of a wood joist floor/ceiling assembly that remained in the same test chamber at an accredited acoustical laboratory over 50 days. The results are compared with previously known variability, and the implications for manufacturers and designers are discussed.","",""

The web service Sci-Hub is amongst the biggest facilitators of this, offering free access to around 62 million publications. So far it is not well studied how and why its users are accessing publications through Sci-Hub. By utilizing the recently released corpus of Sci-Hub and comparing it to the data of ~28 million downloads done through the service, this study tries to address some of these questions. The comparative analysis shows that both the usage and complete corpus is largely made up of recently published articles, with users disproportionately favoring newer articles and 35% of downloaded articles being published after 2013. These results hint that embargo periods before publications become Open Access are frequently circumnavigated using Guerilla Open Access approaches like Sci-Hub. On a journal level, the downloads show a bias towards some scholarly disciplines, especially Chemistry, suggesting increased barriers to access for these. Comparing the use and corpus on a publisher level, it becomes clear that only 11% of publishers are highly requested in comparison to the baseline frequency, while 45% of all publishers are significantly less accessed than expected. Despite this, the oligopoly of publishers is even more remarkable on the level of content consumption, with 80% of all downloads being published through only 9 publishers. All of this suggests that Sci-Hub is used by different populations and for a number of different reasons and that there is still a lack of access to the published scientific record. A further analysis of these openly available data resources will undoubtedly be valuable for the investigation of academic publishing.","",""

In the best case, authors may provide their source code as a compressed archive and they may feel confident their research is reproducible. But this is not exactly true. James Buckheit and David Donoho proposed more than two decades ago that an article about computational results is advertising, not scholarship. The actual scholarship is the full software environment, code, and data that produced the result. This implies new workflows, in particular in peer-reviews. Existing journals have been slow to adapt: source codes are rarely requested, hardly ever actually executed to check that they produce the results advertised in the article. ReScience is a peer-reviewed journal that targets computational research and encourages the explicit replication of already published research, promoting new and open-source implementations in order to ensure that the original research can be replicated from its description. To achieve this goal, the whole publishing chain is radically different from other traditional scientific journals. ReScience resides on GitHub where each new implementation of a computational study is made available together with comments, explanations, and software tests.","",""

Clinical study reports can run to thousands of pages, providing an extensive amount of information on the planning, conduct and results of each trial. After a protracted campaign to obtain the reports, the manufacturers of the medications provided them unconditionally. The review authors subsequently published the underlying documents simultaneously with the Cochrane review, endorsing the concept of open science.

Furthermore, it is also useful to have a baseline of reference data against which to compare the outcome of a particular study. Methods: We scanned both healthy and post–myocardial infarction rats injected with 99m Tc-tetrofosmin in a multidetector, multipinhole small-animal SPECT scanner. In this paper, we report on the creation of a reference database of the relative myocardial blood perfusion of rats. We also evaluated the reproducibility of perfusion measurements and measurements of left ventricle volume and ejection fraction, defined as the SD of a particular measurement repeated on the same animal or over multiple animals. Results: For the healthy rats, interscan reproducibility of volume measurements was 4%–7% of the total volume, and intersubject reproducibility was 9%–12% of the volume being measured. Interscan reproducibility remained unaffected after infarction (6%–8%), but intersubject reproducibility was much poorer (15%–26%). Ejection fraction in healthy animals was highly reproducible between scans and between rats: 3.1% and 3.3%, respectively. Interscan reproducibility of the postinfarction ejection fraction was 3.6%; intersubject reproducibility after infarction was 8.1%. Conclusion: We have created a reference database for small-animal SPECT perfusion measurements in healthy male Sprague–Dawley rats and quantified the reproducibility of perfusion and functional measurement made with small-animal SPECT in healthy and postinfarction rats.",WOS:000293336000044,JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE

Responsible conduct of research is often defined in terms of a set of abstract, normative principles, professional standards, and ethics in doing research. In order to accommodate the normative principles of scientific research, the professional standards, and a researcher’s moral principles, transparent research practices can serve as a framework for responsible conduct of research. We suggest a “prune-and-add” project structure to enhance transparency and, by extension, responsible conduct of research. Questionable research practices are defined as practices that are detrimental to the research process. The prevalence of questionable research practices remains largely unknown, and reproducibility of findings has been shown to be problematic. Questionable practices are discouraged by transparent practices because practices that arise from them will become more apparent to scientific peers. Most effective might be preregistrations of research design, hypotheses, and analyses, which reduce particularism of results by providing an a priori research scheme. Research misconduct has been defined as fabrication, falsification, and plagiarism (FFP), which is clearly the worst type of research practice. Despite it being clearly wrong, it can be approached from a scientific and legal perspective. The legal perspective sees research misconduct as a form of white-collar crime. The scientific perspective seeks to answer the following question: “Were results invalidated because of the misconduct?” We review how misconduct is typically detected, how its detection can be improved, and how prevalent it might be. Institutions could facilitate detection of data fabrication and falsification by implementing data auditing. Nonetheless, the effect of misconduct is pervasive: many retracted articles are still cited after the retraction has been issued. Main points Researchers systematically evaluate their own conduct as more responsible than colleagues, but not as responsible as they would like. Transparent practices, facilitated by the Open Science Framework, help embody scientific norms that promote responsible conduct. Questionable research practices harm the research process and work counter to the generally accepted scientific norms, but are hard to detect. Research misconduct requires active scrutiny of the research community because editors and peer-reviewers do not pay adequate attention to detecting this. Tips are given on how to improve your detection of potential problems.","",""

To address this issue, we investigated the test-retest reproducibility of preclinical cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) at 7 Tesla in healthy C57BL/6 mice, including an analysis of the impact of different anesthetic procedures (isoflurane or pentobarbital). We also analyzed the intra-study reproducibility and the intra- and inter-observer post-processing reproducibility of CMR images. Test-retest reproducibility was high for left ventricular parameters, especially with the isoflurane anesthetic procedure, whereas right ventricular parameters and deformation measurements were less reproducible, mainly due to physiological variability. Post-processing reproducibility of CMR images was high both within and between observers.

The critical care research community has responded admirably to these challenges by rigorously conducting numerous large and often multicenter randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of putative therapies for critical illnesses. Yet in spite of two decades of work, few incontrovertibly efficacious therapies have resulted from this herculean effort (1). The reasons for this are unsettled, but several categories of problems have emerged. The first problem is that of “positive” trials that cannot be replicated (2-15). Since the clinical trial is in essence a diagnostic test of a hypothesis (16), these non-replicable studies represent “false positives.” False positive trials are due to type I errors which are increased by selection of a conventional and lax statistical significance threshold (e.g., α=0.05) (17,18), bias in the study at any stage of design, conduct, analysis and reporting (19), and fraud (20). Recently, the center for open science collaboration demonstrated that the majority of 100 “positive” psychological research studies could not be replicated, suggesting a false positive rate of 63% in that field (21).

In partnership with competent authorities and research organisations in the Member States, EFSA has become a central hub of the European data on food consumption, chemical occurrence and foodborne outbreaks. Beyond EFSA's use of these data and sharing of contaminants and food consumption data with the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization to support international risk assessment, they remain largely unexploited. In addition, for some of its risk assessments, EFSA also relies on published information, as well as on scientific studies sponsored and submitted by industry. The environment in which the Authority operates has significantly evolved since its foundation. The growth of digital technology has granted scientists and consumers alike faster and more efficient access to data and information. The open data movement, which has entered the sphere of the European Union institutions, is unleashing the potential for reuse of data. In parallel, the work of EFSA is increasingly subject to demands for more openness and transparency across its spectrum of stakeholders. EFSA aims to enhance the quality and transparency of its outputs by giving access to data and promoting the development of collaborative platforms in Europe and internationally. EFSA also plans to work with data providers and organisations funding research to adopt open data concepts and standards; gaining better access to, and making better use of, data from a wider evidence base.

The H2020 project OpenUP aspires to bring all these stakeholders into an open dialogue to consensually identify and spread the review-disseminate-assess mechanisms advancing evolving practices of RRI in an Open Science context. OpenUP will actively engage research communities and implement a series of hands-on pilots to validate OpenUP’s proposed (open) peer review, innovative dissemination, and impact indicator frameworks. The pilots will be carried out in close cooperation with selected, devoted research communities from four scientific areas: arts and humanities, social sciences, life sciences, and energy. This poster visualises UpenUP’s pilot design exemplified by two of the seven Open Science Pilots to be conducted by the project: 1) Open Peer Review for Conferences, and 2) Addressing and Reaching Businesses and the Public with Research Output. The first pilot will evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of open peer reviewing in a conference setting. The specific implementation of the applied schema will be determined by the results from the state of the art study as well as the user questionnaire answers from other work packages of OpenUP. In comparison to the traditional way (double-blind evaluation of submitted papers by assigned reviewers chosen by the conference organisers) the new schema should allow for a more open and fair process as well as give additional incentives to reviewers. The actual pilot study will be conducted at a medium sized conference in consultation with the conference organisers. Follow-up questionnaires and interviews will show if the stakeholders preferred the new process and can provide constructive feedback for improvements and policy decisions. The second pilot will test existing and potential alternative forms, formats, and channels of open science communication, and explore how the targeted audiences, in particular businesses and the public, can be best reached via these channels. In a preparatory phase the team will map open science communication formats/channels and their targeted audiences. The team will conduct a workshop to elicit the targeted stakeholders’ requirements and expectations towards a useful and appealing communication of scientific contents. This will be the basis of the second pilot presented here. It will actively involve one or more energy research community projects beyond the OpenUP consortium. The goals are to test the previously established communication standards and channels for the energy area, and evaluate the impact and resonance at the targeted audiences. By actively involving research communities and other relevant stakeholders into the pilots, OpenUP will not only evaluate the practicability of the identified open peer review, innovative dissemination, and impact measurement methods in particular settings. It also intends to create and disseminate success stories, best/good practices, and policy recommendations, which will help further communities to implement working Open Science approaches in their research evaluation and communication strategies.","",""

The primary aim of the study was to investigate intra- and inter-observer reproducibility of Uterine Artery (UtA) Pulsatility Index (PI) in the third trimester of pregnancy. The secondary aim of the study was to examine whether high maternal Body Mass Index (BMI) or gestational age (GA) influence the reliability of this measurement.

Methods
Singleton pregnancies in women with known BMI were recruited between 30+0 and 40+0 weeks. UtA PI Doppler measurements were performed prospectively, independently and blindly by two Fetal Medicine Foundation accredited operators. Intra- and inter-observer reproducibility was assessed by Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC); Bland-Altman Plots were built and Limits of Agreement (LoA) were calculated. The analysis was performed for both raw numbers and percentiles. To estimate the intra- and inter-operators agreement in defining normal and pathological measurements the assessments were divided in two categories- UtA PI <95th percentile/ ≥95th percentile- and Cohen's kappa coefficients were calculated. Results were interpreted according to the cut-offs reported by the True Reproducibility of Ultrasound Techniques Review. Correlation between maternal BMI and GA and accuracy of UtA measurements was studied with Spearman's correlation coefficient.

Results
Measurements were available in 101 women. For intra-observer reproducibility ICCs and CCCs were calculated for raw values and percentiles and were 0.912 and 0.835, 0.837 and 0.716, respectively. For inter-observer reproducibility ICCs and CCCs were 0.809 and 0.732, 0.677 and 0.576, respectively. This indicates a poor-moderate reproducibility of third trimester UtA PI. LoAs were also wide (from a minimum of -0.30-0.35 to a maximum of -0.53-0.62). Cohen's kappa coefficients were 0.478 and 0.418, showing a moderate intra and inter-operator agreement in distinguishing between normal and pathological values. No correlation was found between maternal BMI and GA and reproducibility of the measurements.

Conclusions
Intra and inter-observer reproducibility of third trimester UtA PI as assessed by ICC, CCC and LoA is only moderate-poor. The agreement between operators in defining pathological and normal measurements is moderate.",WOS:000418715200003,PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS

A number of different technologies have been developed to assess the copy-number landscape, allowing us to better understand the role of CNA in cancer cells. The OncoScan CNA platform (Affymetrix Inc.) has been particularly appealing for oncology due of its ability to work well with formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) materials, which is the primary form for storage of clinical samples. In addition, its high resolution, rapid analysis time and ability to interrogate different genomic characteristics (CNA, loss of heterozygosity or mutation) make the OncoScan platform highly popular: it has been widely cited in the literature for use in biomarker discovery, clonal evolution and sub-clonal detection, as well as population-based analyses. While CNAs identified by the OncoScan platform have shown good concordance with fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) results, to date, no studies have been conducted to thoroughly assess the reproducibility of the assay. In this study, we have assessed the reproducibility of the OncoScan platform using identical samples performed in replicates across multiple chip batches. Moreover, we have assessed the effect on reproducibility of DNA treatment, including elution in water or TE buffer, as well as in the use of varying amounts of DNA. Methods: Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Express 3.0 SNP Arrays were performed using the optimal input DNA as recommended by the manufacturer as well as fewer input amounts for comparison. CNAs were called using BioDiscovery Nexus Copy Number™ software (http://www.biodiscovery.com/software/nexus-copy-number/) using the SNP-FASST2 algorithm with modified parameters (significance threshold of 1 x 10 -9 and minimum number of probes per segment of 10). Results: Initial reproducibility analysis involving 12 samples repeated either 2, 4 or 6 times both within a single batch and across different batches has revealed that CNA calls were concordant between replicates for the majority of the genome (ranges between 81% to 100%), suggesting high precision of the assay. In addition, we are in the process of assessing and comparing mutation calls across replicates to gain a more in-depth understanding of the platform. Conclusion: This is the first study examining the reproducibility of OncoScan FFPE assays; initial results have suggested that the assay is precise and has the potential for robust biomarker discovery. Additional characterizations would be interesting for evaluating its use as a clinical tool in the long term.

The aim of this study was to determine the reproducibility and accuracy of linear measurements on 2 types of dental models derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans: CBCT images, and Anatomodels (InVivoDental, San Jose, Calif); these were compared with digital models generated from dental impressions (Digimodels; Orthoproof, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands). The Digimodels were used as the reference standard.

METHODS

The 3 types of digital models were made from 10 subjects. Four examiners repeated 37 linear tooth and arch measurements 10 times. Paired t tests and the intraclass correlation coefficient were performed to determine the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurements.

RESULTS

The CBCT images showed significantly smaller intraclass correlation coefficient values and larger duplicate measurement errors compared with the corresponding values for Digimodels and Anatomodels. The average difference between measurements on CBCT images and Digimodels ranged from -0.4 to 1.65 mm, with limits of agreement values up to 1.3 mm for crown-width measurements. The average difference between Anatomodels and Digimodels ranged from -0.42 to 0.84 mm with limits of agreement values up to 1.65 mm.

CONCLUSIONS

Statistically significant differences between measurements on Digimodels and Anatomodels, and between Digimodels and CBCT images, were found. Although the mean differences might be clinically acceptable, the random errors were relatively large compared with corresponding measurements reported in the literature for both Anatomodels and CBCT images, and might be clinically important. Therefore, with the CBCT settings used in this study, measurements made directly on CBCT images and Anatomodels are not as accurate as measurements on Digimodels.",WOS:000341305800011,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

Given the pace at which heterogeneous data are published on the web, thanks to initiatives such as Linked Data and Open Science, scalability of data exchange becomes crucial. Pivotal to data exchange is the chase algorithm, which is a fixpoint algorithm to evaluate both source-to-target constraints and target constraints in the data exchange process. In this paper, we investigate how new programming models such as MapReduce can be used to implement the chase on large-scale data sources.

Recent systematic reviews highlight the problem, with one example demonstrating that an average of 13% of studies per year (±8.0 [SD]) failed to report sample sizes. The problem affects the ability to verify the accuracy of any analysis, to repeat methods used, and to assimilate the study findings into powerful and useful meta‐analyses.

However, there are limited data on the reproducibility of this measurement in an older population. The present study examined the reproducibility of MUAC measurements in older persons, as well as the influence of different body positions and clothing. Methods: A cross-sectional reproducibility study was performed in a nursing home (n = 43; age 65-96 years) and swimming pool facilities (n = 107; age 65-88 years). A different pair of observers independently measured the MUAC of each participant in the upright position on two occasions within 1 week. In the nursing home, measurements were also performed for each participant in the laying position and with clothes covering the upper arm. Results: Mean differences and the 95% limit of agreement for inter-observer reproducibility of MUAC were 0.0 cm (-2.6 to 2.5 cm) for the swimming pool facilities and 0.3 cm (-0.6 to 1.3 cm) for the nursing home. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) were 0.89 and 0.92, respectively. Mean differences between laying and upright positions were 0.1 cm (-2.0 to 2.2 cm) and 0.0 cm (-1.9 to 2.0 cm) for each observer, respectively (ICC 0.96-0.97). Mean differences between clothes versus bare upper arm were -2.7 cm (-6.2 to 0.7) and -2.4 (-5.6 to 0.9 cm) (ICC 0.75 and 0.78). Conclusions: The reproducibility of the MUAC measurement in older persons is acceptable for group comparisons and, although borderline for the swimming pool facilities, remains acceptable for clinical purposes. The measurement can also be performed in the laying position but not with clothes covering the upper arm. © 2012 The Authors Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics © 2012 The British Dietetic Association Ltd.",WOS:000313899800004,JOURNAL OF HUMAN NUTRITION AND DIETETICS

Measurement properties of tests to assess reading acuity or reading performance have not been extensively evaluated. This study aims to provide an overview of the literature on available continuous text reading tests and their measurement properties.



Methods

A literature search was performed in PubMed, Embase and PsycInfo. Subsequently, information on design and content of reading tests, study design and measurement properties were extracted using consensus-based standards for selection of health measurement instruments. Quality of studies, reading tests and measurement properties were systematically assessed using pre-specified criteria.



Results

From 2334 identified articles, 20 relevant articles were found on measurement properties of three reading tests in various languages: IReST, MNread Reading Test and Radner Reading Charts. All three reading tests scored high on content validity. Reproducibility studies (repeated measurements between different testing sessions) of the IReST and MNread of commercially available reading tests in different languages were missing. The IReST scored best on inter-language comparison, the MNread scored well in repeatability studies (repeated measurements under the same conditions) and the Radner showed good reproducibility in studies.



Conclusions

Although in daily practice there are other continuous text reading tests available meeting the criteria of this review, measurement properties were described in scientific studies for only three of them. Of the few available studies, the quality and content of study design and methodology used varied. For testing existing reading tests and the development of new ones, for example in other languages, we make several recommendations, including careful description of patient characteristics, use of objective and subjective lighting levels, good control of working distance, documentation of the number of raters and their training, careful documentation of scoring rules and the use of Bland-Altman analyses or similar for reproducibility and repeatability studies.",WOS:000344372900003,OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS

A Validity and Reproducibility Study,7,"This study investigated the added value, i.e. discriminative and concurrent validity and reproducibility, of an eye-hand coordination test relevant to table tennis as part of talent identification. Forty-three table tennis players (7-12 years) from national (n = 13), regional (n = 11) and local training centres (n = 19) participated. During the eye-hand coordination test, children needed to throw a ball against a vertical positioned table tennis table with one hand and to catch the ball correctly with the other hand as frequently as possible in 30 seconds. Four different test versions were assessed varying the distance to the table (1 or 2 meter) and using a tennis or table tennis ball. 'Within session' reproducibility was estimated for the two attempts of the initial tests and ten youngsters were retested after 4 weeks to estimate 'between sessions' reproducibility. Validity analyses using age as covariate showed that players from the national and regional centres scored significantly higher than players from the local centre in all test versions (p<0.05). The tests at 1 meter demonstrated better discriminative ability than those at 2 meter. While all tests but one had a positive significant association with competition outcome, which were corrected for age influences, the version with a table tennis ball at 1 meter showed the highest association (r = 0.54; p = 0.001). Differences between the first and second attempts were comparable for all test versions (between -8 and +7 repetitions) with ICC's ranging from 0.72 to 0.87. The smallest differences were found for the test with a table tennis ball at 1 meter (between -3 and +3 repetitions). Best test version as part of talent identification appears to be the version with a table tennis ball at 1 meter regarding the psychometric characteristics evaluated. Longitudinal studies are necessary to evaluate the predictive value of this test.",WOS:000330237000050,PLOS ONE

The aim of this study was to test the reproducibility of the Heidelberg Spectralis SD-OCT and to determine if provided software retest function for follow-up exam is superior to manual centration. Design. Prospective, cross-sectional study. Participants. 20 healthy subjects. Methods. All subjects underwent SD-OCT testing to determine retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) measurements sequentially on two different days and with two different centration techniques. Within-subject standard deviation, coefficient of variation, and intraclass correlation coefficient were used to assess reproducibility. Results. RNFL measurements showed high reproducibility, low within-subject standard deviation (1.3), low coefficient of variation (0.63%), and low intra-class correlation coefficient (0.98 (95% CI 0.97–0.99)) in the automated centration and manual centration groups for average RNFL Thickness. Quadrants showed slightly higher variability in the manual group compared to the automated group (within-subject standard deviation 2.5–5.3 versus 1.1–2.4, resp.). Conclusions. SD-OCT provides high-resolution RNFL measurements with high reproducibility and low variability. The re-test function allows for easier recentration for longitudinal examinations with similar results in average RNFL, but less variability in quadrant RNFL. SD-OCT high reproducibility and low variability is a promising fact and should be further evaluated in longitudinal studies of RNFL.","",""

Today, a typical experiment can simultaneously measure hundreds to thousands of individual features (e.g. genes) in dozens of biological conditions, resulting in gigabytes of data that need to be processed and analyzed. Because of the multiple steps involved in the data generation and analysis and the lack of details provided, it can be difficult for independent researchers to try to reproduce a published study. With the recent outrage following the halt of a cancer clinical trial due to the lack of reproducibility of the published study, researchers are now facing heavy pressure to ensure that their results are reproducible. Despite the global demand, too many published studies remain non-reproducible mainly due to the lack of availability of experimental protocol, data and/or computer code. Scientific discovery is an iterative process, where a published study generates new knowledge and data, resulting in new follow-up studies or clinical trials based on these results. As such, it is important for the results of a study to be quickly confirmed or discarded to avoid wasting time and money on novel projects. The availability of high-quality, reproducible data will also lead to more powerful analyses (or meta-analyses) where multiple data sets are combined to generate new knowledge. In this article, we review some of the recent developments regarding biomedical reproducibility and comparability and discuss some of the areas where the overall field could be improved.",WOS:000322341200001,BRIEFINGS IN BIOINFORMATICS

Repeatability and reproducibility coefficients [Bland and Altman’s coefficient (BAC), coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation (ICC)] were calculated for Orbscan anterior and posterior BFS, Sim-K and corneal pachymetry (central, superior, inferior, nasal and temporal locations). Repeatability was calculated using three consecutive measurements during each visit, while reproducibility was calculated using the average of the measurements obtained at each visit. High repeatability was found for all Orbscan measurements (r2 0.05, two-way ANOVA) with BAC and CV 0.05 two-way ANOVA). BAC values were less than 1% for both BFS and Sim- K, and between 1.21 and 2.20% for corneal pachymetry.

To cope with the complex computational demands of huge biological datasets, a shift to distributed compute resources is unavoidable. A case study was conducted in which three well established bioinformatics analysis groups across Australia were assigned to analyse exome sequence data from a range of patients with a rare condition: disorder of sex development. Initially these groups used their own in-house data processing pipelines, and subsequently used a common bioinformatics workbench based upon Galaxy and offered through the Australia-wide National eResearch Collaboration Tools and Resources (NeCTAR) Research Cloud.

Well ahead of its time, the fMRIDC effort encountered logistical, sociocultural and funding barriers that impeded the field-wise instantiation of open-access data sharing. In 2009, ambitions for open-access data sharing were revived in the resting state functional MRI community in the form of two grassroots initiatives: the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and its successor, the International Neuroimaging Datasharing Initiative (INDI). Beyond providing open access to thousands of clinical and non-clinical imaging datasets, the FCP and INDI have also demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale data aggregation for hypothesis generation and testing. Yet, the success of the FCP and INDI should not be confused with widespread embracement of open-access data sharing. Reminiscent of the challenges faced by fMRIDC, key controversies persist and include participant privacy, the role of informatics, and the logistical and cultural challenges of establishing an open science ethos.

Together these create a very useful standard for reviewers, program committees, and journal editors; work in information retrieval (IR) increasingly cannot be published unless it has been evaluated using a well-constructed test collection and shown to produce a statistically significant improvement over a good baseline. But, as the saying goes, any tool sharp enough to be useful is also sharp enough to be dangerous. Statistical tests of significance are widely misunderstood. Most researchers and developers treat them as a \"black box\": evaluation results go in and a p-value comes out. But because significance is such an important factor in determining what research directions to explore and what is published, using p-values obtained without thought can have consequences for everyone doing research in IR. Ioannidis has argued that the main consequence in the biomedical sciences is that most published research findings are false [12]; could that be the case in IR as well?","",""

A brief scan of a newspaper or quick Internet search reveals it as a prefix to learning, source, standard, data, knowledge, democracy, access, repository, innovation, government, science and probably more. The expectations of the broadband generation--young people born around the turn of the century--for openness and instant, on-demand access to information (1) affect research as much as any other social activity. As the world's population of digital residents--those who see the Web as the place where they express opinions, form relationships, develop an identity and belong to a community (2)--grows, the expectation that the Web will be the place where information is created and communicated will grow alongside them. In response, the media have become hydra-headed and researchers have become public intellectuals in unforeseen ways: online editions of what we used to call newspapers include comment pages, blogs, and links to journal papers (3), citizen journalism thrives, radio and television programmes sprout links to university websites, educational material and background material, and no self-respecting research project seems complete without its website and social media accounts. However, while these and other routes seem to offer interested viewers the chance (paraphrasing Newton) to peer over the giants' shoulders and see what they're doing in their ivory fortresses, those attempting this feat can find themselves routinely frustrated by blocked access, paywalls, out-of-date websites, subscription demands and curtailed documents. In the UK, USA, Europe and Australasia, since the mid-twentieth century, scientists have increasingly demonstrated a willingness to engage with the public (and indeed, members of the public shown a willingness to engage with science). Over time, the labels have changed: scientific literacy, public understanding of science, scientific culture, public awareness of science, science communication, public engagement with science (4,5) but the interaction has always tended to be after the research is over and the researchers can show the public a clean, crystalline sphere of perfected results. Science is not like that, as scientists know; real research is messy, tentative and dynamic. To see its real creativity and inventiveness, we need to see the scientist in action in the laboratory, banging the test tubes together (6). 'Open science', which Neilsen (p.32) defines (7) as the sharing of 'everything--data, scientific opinions, questions, ideas, folk knowledge, workflows and everything else as it happens' (8) is an emerging approach to the practice of science, in which the whole research process is conducted in the open, from formulating research questions, to designing methodologies, to publishing data and results. This wholly open approach, sometimes called 'open notebook science' (9) is, in practice, followed by only a relatively small group of strong advocates (10). However, many researchers are happy to be open with certain aspects of their work: publishing in open access journals (which is becoming more common, especially as funders increasingly make this a condition of grants); depositing copies of publications in open institutional repositories or disciplinary archives (such as arXiv.org for maths and physics); maintaining websites, writing research blogs, contributing to social citation services and communicating about their work on social media. In fact, many of the behaviours that make research open can be seen as extensions or an evolution of day-to-day work: the paper notebook is replaced by an electronic version, from which data can be automatically collated and made to flow on to a project website; a research log becomes a research blog, enhanced by a blog's ability to support dialogue through comments and responses; documents are collaboratively created and the common room chat migrates to social media. …","",""

Over the last few years, this technique is mainly being developed in the field of maxillofacial reconstructive surgery, creating fusion images with computed tomography (CT) data for precise planning and prediction of treatment outcome. Though, in hand surgery 3D stereophotogrammetry is not yet being used in clinical settings. METHODS: A total of 34 three-dimensional hand photographs were analyzed to investigate the reproducibility. For every individual, 3D photographs were captured at two different time points (baseline T0 and one week later T1). Using two different registration methods, the reproducibility of the methods was analyzed. Furthermore, the differences between 3D photos of men and women were compared in a distance map as a first clinical pilot testing our registration method. RESULTS: The absolute mean registration error for the complete hand was 1.46 mm. This reduced to an error of 0.56 mm isolating the region to the palm of the hand. When comparing hands of both sexes, it was seen that the male hand was larger (broader base and longer fingers) than the female hand. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that 3D stereophotogrammetry can produce reproducible images of the hand without harmful side effects for the patient, so proving to be a reliable method for soft tissue analysis. Its potential use in everyday practice of hand surgery needs to be further explored.",WOS:000361601100022,PLOS ONE

To evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of intima thickness (IT) measurements at different sites along the common carotid artery and compare with intima–media thickness (IMT) measurements.



Methods.

Ultrasound examinations of common carotid artery were performed in 30 healthy subjects and 20 patients with diabetes mellitus. Carotid IT and IMT were measured at 10 mm, 13 mm, and 16 mm upstream from the carotid bulb. Each subject was scanned by three operators to evaluate inter-operator reproducibility. Each operator scanned the subjects twice to evaluate intra-operator repeatability. Inter-equipment reproducibility of the measurements was evaluated.



Results.

The inter-operator reproducibility for measuring carotid IT at the three sites was 81.5%, 81.9% and 69.1%, respectively, slightly lower than carotid IMT measurement (89.7%, 86.5%, 75.2%, respectively). The intra-operator repeatability for carotid IT measurement at the three sites ranged 76.9–89.5%, 67.4–90.3%, and 55.2–70.5%, respectively, and was lower than for IMT measurement (86.5–96.9%, 87.6–95.7%, 79.9–86.5%, respectively). The inter-equipment reproducibility of IMT (75.7–86.6%) was slightly better than for IT measurement (71.4–75.9%).



Conclusions.

Ultrasonographic measurement of carotid IT is repeatable and reproducible, although not as good as IMT. Measurements preformed 10 mm to 13 mm upstream from the carotid bulb yield more repeatable and reproducible results. © 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The purpose of this study is to suggest effective use of reading methods for reducing the uncertainty in dose measurements through the investigation of characteristics of GD‐based reader system. Methods: To evaluate the characteristics of reader's, we performed measurement such as reproducibility of repeated reading, readout variation according to the number of GD loading on readout magazine, and deviation depending on each magazine position. To evaluate dose reproducibility we made a try to do repeated reading up to 200 times for each 15 GDs. Also, to evaluate readout variation characteristic, 80 GDs are irradiated one by one under the same irradiation conditions. Reading process was measured with 4 different cases. Lastly, to measure the deviation magazine position, we examine the readout values according to each loading position.Results: According to measurement result, reproducibility shows 1.3% lower measurement from total 200 times. Readout sensitivity of GD on magazine values is normalized to 1st position response. 1 to 5th position measured 1.015, also 1 to 10th position examined 1.022, and 1 to 20th position presented 1.035. Lastly, at all position except for 20th position of magazine, response is tend to increase gradually. It was overestimated on 2.0% of average rather than response at reference position (first position). Conclusions: According to the result, we should put each GD in consecutive order from 1st space of magazine to get accuracy value of dose and it is recommended that reading process should be performed the only first position of magazine with regard to absolute dosimetry.

Objective: To assess the cultural adaptation and reproducibility of the Measure Yourself Medical Outcome Profile (MYMOP2) questionnaire in a sample of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: The study sample consisted of 50 patients undergoing cardiac surgery for myocardial and valve revascularization, which were recruited from the cardiac ICU of a private hospital in Maceio, Alagoas. The MYMOP2 questionnaire was initially translated into Brazilian Portuguese. Cultural and conceptual adaptation were performed, so that patients were able to understand questions. All patients answered this instrument twice, on the same day, with two different interviewers, with an interval of 30 minutes between the interviews. After one day, the questionnaire was repeated on a second visit. This process was carried out with MYMOP and MYMOP2 FOLLOW UP. Reproducibility and validity were tested. Results: Cultural adaptations were made, so that the final version was obtained. Spearman correlation coefficient for MYMOP2 was 1 and FOLLOW UP was 0.794, p < 0.001. There were moderate correlations with the domains of the EQ-5D. MYMOP2 was validated and supported by a significant correlation between change scores and MYMOP2 change scores and the ability to detect an improvement in acute conditions. Conclusion: MYMOP2 questionnaire is reproducible, easy to understand and quick to apply. It should be included and used in any Brazilian study with the objective to assess disease impact over time.","",""

To reach that aim, the Open Science and Research (ATT) Initiative was launched in 2014. Lead by the Ministry of Education and Culture, the ATT Initiative has funded a number of projects that support good research data management, opening of research data, and Open Access in general. The Initiative also emphasises cooperation and interoperability nationally, and internationally. The National Library of Finland and other research libraries have an important role in the ATT Initiative. Libraries are in a good position to make meaningful contributions as they can repurpose their expertise on metadata, information retrieval, and collection management. They are finding new ways of collaboration and creating services in the fields of Open Access and Open Science. Libraries and other service providers should, first and foremost, respect the needs of research and researchers: science should always be the guiding force. But Open Access and Open Science do have an effect on how research is conducted and published. Therefore, it must be possible to have a critical look on conventional research practices. Increasing amounts of data, new technological possibilities, and new methods of analysis mean that old practices need to be revised. The more pronounced demands of interoperability and innovative re-usability drive for change, too. Of course, the funders are also very keen on cost-efficiency and measurable impact. There is a demand for harmonisation, collaboration, and shared infrastructures and services. The Open Scientific Publishing Project (TAJUA) in the National Library of Finland is a part of the ATT Initiative. The main focus of the project is to increase and improve the availability of Finnish research output. It comprises of several subprojects that build on the existing expertise of the Library, taking it to new directions. They deal with improving the institutional repository infrastructure provided by the National Library, with special attention to organisations with restricted resources and basic demands; better guidance for institutional repositories on best practices in metadata creation, licensing, and in gathering statistics in a commensurable manner; a tool for easy creation of metadata about research datasets; improved persistent identifier services (ISNI, ORCID, URN, etc.); better understanding of economics of Open Access publishing, e.g. real level of APC, and recommendations for changes in publishing workflows; and recommendations for ensuring long-term accessibility of scientific output. The TAJUA project complements others under the umbrella of the ATT Initiative. They deal with more efficient publishing workflows, data management planning, opening datasets, training and education on Open Science, and tools to enrich and work up open linked data. Existing national services on data storage, preservation, and dissemination will also be extended. Research libraries should not be shy about their knowledge and skills. With metadata being the new black, they can really make their mark on the world of Open Science.","",""

The main factors which can influence the reproducibility are the descriptors (resources, system variables, code variables, inputs, parameters etc. required to re-execute the workflow) that are continuously changing in time or become unavailable during the years (typically third party resources). The ultimate goal of my research is to reveal the behavior of the crucial descriptors which can prevent the reproducibility and to find the relationship between the change of the descriptors and the change of the result. Based on the nature of the change, and its relation to the result evaluation can be performed to replace the missing descriptor values with simulated ones. In this way we intend to support the scientist to create a reproducible scientific workflow. In addition, with determining the probability of the reproducibility we can also help the scientists to find the most suitable scientific workflow in a repository which they can reuse and create their own experiment.","",""

Central vein point-of-care ultrasonography must be reproducible to detect intravascular volume changes. We sought to determine which measurement step, image acquisition or interpretation, could be more compromising for reproducibility.

Methods
Three investigators each acquired inferior vena cava (IVC) and internal jugular (IJV) vein ultrasonographic sequences (US) from a convenience sample of 21 hospitalized general medicine participants and then interpreted each US three separate times. We partitioned the random errors of acquisition and interpretation, attributing wider dispersions of each to larger reductions in reproducibility.

Results
We analyzed 351 interpretations of 39 IVC and 432 interpretations of 48 IJV US. Reproducibility of the maximum (standard error of measurement 3.3 mm [95% confidence interval, CI 2.7–4.2 mm]) and minimum (4.8 mm [3.9–6.3 mm]) IVC diameter measurements were worse than that of the mediolateral (2.5 mm [2.0–3.2 mm]) and anteroposterior (2.5 mm [2.0–3.1 mm]) IJV diameters. The dispersions of random measurement errors were wider among acquisitions than interpretations.

Conclusions
Among our investigators, central vein diameter measurements obtained by point-of-care ultrasonography are not sufficiently reproducible to distinguish clinically meaningful intravascular volume changes from measurement errors. Reproducibility could be most effectively improved by reducing the random measurement errors of acquisition. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Manchester Foot Pain and Disability Index (MFPDI) is a 19-item questionnaire for the assessment of disability caused by foot pain. The aim was to develop a Danish language version of the MFPDI (MFPDI-DK) and evaluate its reproducibility and construct validity. Methods. A Danish version was created, following a forward-backward translation procedure. A sample of 84 adult patients with foot pain was recruited. Participants completed two copies of the MFPDI-DK within a 24- to 48-hour interval, along with the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36 (SF-36), and a pain Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Reproducibility was assessed using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and 95% limits of agreement (Bland-Altman plot). Construct validity was evaluated with Pearson's Rho, using a priori hypothesized correlations with SF-36 subscales and VASmean. Results. The MFPDI-DK showed very good reliability with an ICC of 0.92 (0.88–0.95). The 95% limits of agreement ranged from −6.03 to 6.03 points. Construct validity was supported by moderate to very strong correlations with the SF-36 physical subscales and VASmean. Conclusion. The MFPDI-DK appears to be a valid and reproducible instrument in evaluating foot-pain-related disability in Danish adult patients in cross-sectional samples. Further research is needed to test the responsiveness of the MFPDI-DK.",WOS:000215764200008,PAIN RESEARCH AND TREATMENT

It is run as a lean not-for-profit organisation with research organisations (both academic and industrial) as paying members. The small staff of the organisation undertakes a variety of tasks that are necessary to perform or support modern academic research, but that are not easily undertaken in a purely academic setting. DTL Data takes care of such tasks related to data stewardship, facilitating exchange of knowledge and expertise, and brokering access to e-infrastructure. DTL also represents the Netherlands in ELIXIR, the European infrastructure for life science data. The organisation is still being fine-tuned and this will continue over time, as it is crucial for this kind of organisation to adapt to a constantly changing environment. However, already being underway for several years, our experiences can benefit researchers in other fields or other countries setting up similar initiatives.","",""

The advent of the internet has meant that scholarly communication has changed immeasurably over the past two decades but in some ways it has hardly changed at all. The coin in the realm of any research remains the publication of novel results in a high impact journal – despite known issues with the Journal Impact Factor. This elusive goal has led to many problems in the research process: from hyperauthorship to high levels of retractions, reproducibility problems and 'cherry picking' of results. The veracity of the academic record is increasingly being brought into question. An additional problem is this static reward systems binds us to the current publishing regime, preventing any real progress in terms of widespread open access or even adoption of novel publishing opportunities. But there is a possible solution. Increased calls to open research up and provide a greater level of transparency have started to yield practical real solutions.

Scientific research is not exempt from these changes: the free and rapid flow of information, ideas and documents will both require and foster new habits of collaboration among researchers, stimulate economic activities and even improve public dialogue on science (http://royalsociety.org/policy/projects/science-public-enterprise/report/). “A growing body of evidence suggests that public visibility and constructive conversation on social media networks can be beneficial for scientists, impacting research in a number of key ways,” wrote computational biologist Holly Bik and marine biologist Miriam Goldstein [1]. The digital revolution could herald a new era of “open science” where scientists freely and easily share published work, experimental data, ideas and opinions and mutually benefit from the open and collaborative realm that is emerging in the digital age. Yet, not all is brave in the new digital world and scientists seem to be rather reluctant to engage in what the web 2.0 has to offer in terms of exchanging ideas.

Most scientists use social media for two main reasons: networking with other researchers and for public visibility (Fig 1). “Scientists need to be engaged in new media platforms because everyone else is already talking about their thoughts and feelings, having discussions about things they care about, and generally—as the name implies—being social,” commented marine biologist and blogger Christie Wilcox [2]. Beyond making research more visible to funders or policymakers, social media may also help to build dialogue and constructive conversation with the general public, in particularly about sensitive topics, such as stem cell research or genetically modified food. “[W]e have to make a concentrated effort to get involved in the public discussion about science.

After controlling for founders' prior work experience and other organizational and environmental factors, I find that firms with proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs on the founding team have a higher probability of adopting open science. In addition, founders' educational background can mitigate the constraint of organizational environments on strategy. A crowded technological niche provides a more challenging environment for firms to implement open science, due to higher scooping risks. The deterrent effect, however, of such a high-risk environment is smaller among firms founded by proportionally more Ph.D.-holding entrepreneurs. There is also some evidence of a stronger effect of founders' educational background on open science in an institutional environment in which open science has yet to become the industry norm. This finding is consistent with and complements the growing body of research that emphasizes the importance of entrepreneurial background in developing knowledge about new-venture strategy and structure.

Computers play a vital role in many research disciplines and present both opportunities and challenges for reproducibility. Computers can be programmed to execute analysis tasks, and those programs can be repeated and shared with others. The deterministic nature of most computer programs means that the same analysis tasks, applied to the same data, will often produce the same outputs. However, in practice, computational findings often cannot be reproduced because of complexities in how software is packaged, installed, and executed—and because of limitations associated with how scientists document analysis steps. Many tools and techniques are available to help overcome these challenges; here we describe seven such strategies. With a broad scientific audience in mind, we describe the strengths and limitations of each approach, as well as the circumstances under which each might be applied.

We propose a strategy to improve confidence in the interpretation of measured changes in ADC using a data-driven model that describes sources of measurement error. Observed ADC is then standardised against this estimation of uncertainty for any given measurement. 20 patients were recruited prospectively and equitably across 4 sites, and scanned twice (test-retest) within 7 days. Repeatability measurements of defined regions (ROIs) of tumour and normal tissue were quantified as percentage change in mean ADC (test vs. re-test) and then standardised against an estimation of uncertainty. Multi-site reproducibility, (quantified as width of the 95% confidence bound between the lower confidence interval and higher confidence interval for all repeatability measurements), was compared before and after standardisation to the model. The 95% confidence interval width used to determine a statistically significant change reduced from 21.1 to 2.7% after standardisation. Small tumour volumes and respiratory motion were found to be important contributors to poor reproducibility. A look up chart has been provided for investigators who would like to estimate uncertainty from statistical error on individual ADC measurements.",WOS:000413816000014,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS

Digital image analysis (DIA) is increasingly implemented in histopathological research to facilitate truly quantitative measurements, decrease inter-observer variation and reduce hands-on time. Originally, efforts were made to enable DIA to reproduce manually obtained results on histological slides optimized for light microscopy and the human eye. With improved technical methods and the acknowledgement that computerized readings are different from analysis by human eye, recognition has been achieved that to really empower DIA, histological slides must be optimized for the digital ‘eye’, with reproducible results correlating with clinical findings. In this review, we focus on the basic expectations and requirements for DIA to gain wider use in histopathological research and diagnostics. With a reference to studies that specifically compare DIA with conventional methods, this review discusses reproducibility, application of stereology-based quantitative measurements, time consumption, optimization of histological slides, regions of interest selection and recent developments in staining and imaging techniques.",WOS:000301656000003,APMIS

This error may vary between measured dimensions or with degrees of physical deterioration. We investigate this problem with a paleontological sample of five bison radii displaying different levels of physical deterioration. We instructed twelve students to repeatedly measure two dimensions on each radius. The measurement data reveal between dimension variability in how well students repeat their own measurements and variability in how well they reproduce each other's measurements. Further, for one dimension, physical deterioration affects measurement repeatability and reproducibility. Our results suggest that analysts should exercise more care in selecting which bones they include in metric studies of fossil bison. Further, in paleozoological studies generally, analysts should calculate measurement errors using the most weathered and error prone specimens that they wish to include in a measured sample. When possible, these errors should be a product of repeated measurements by multiple analysts to ensure reproducibility.",WOS:000348621400021,JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE

While individual studies have compared different tests, a systematic assessment of this data has not been performed. We therefore aimed to review the repeatability (variation in tests performed on the same day), reproducibility (variation in tests performed on different days), sensitivity and comparability between and within exercise tests in adult patients with COPD.

Methods A systematic review of Embase, MEDLINE® and the Cochrane Library identified primary manuscripts in English reporting relevant data on the following exercise tests: six- and twelve-minute walk tests (6MWTs and 12MWTs), incremental and endurance shuttle walk tests (ISWTs and ESWTs), treadmill test (TT), and incremental and endurance cycle ergometer tests (ICETs and ECETs). Comparability within exercise tests was assessed by examining studies that compared different protocols of the same test type.

Results We identified 90 relevant studies ([Figure 1][1]). The majority of studies exploring repeatability and/or reproducibility examined the 6MWT, 12MWT and ISWT; no studies examined repeatability in treadmill and cycle tests. Only four studies reported the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC); two examined repeatability and reproducibility of the 6MWT (ICCs = 0.94 and 0.88, respectively), and a further two reported reproducibility of the ECET and endurance TT (ICCs = 0.85 and 0.84, respectively). These data indicate good repeatability/reproducibility, but other studies contradict these findings. Prior familiarisation consistently improved repeatability and reproducibility of tests. Most relevant studies reported that exercise tests were sensitive to interventions, but the magnitude of response varied between test types and depended on the intervention and outcome assessed. Protocol variations, such as in track layout or supplemental oxygen use, affected performance in the majority of studies identified. Studies with pair-wise comparisons between walk tests, cycle tests, and walk and cycle tests reported inconsistent comparability between test types.

Abstract P40 Figure 1. 
Breakdown of the relevant studies. Numbers of studies that contain data examining the repeatability, reproducibility, sensitivity and comparability (within and between different tests) for the different exercise tests. As some studies fall into more than one category, the combined number of studies in this figure exceeds 90.



Conclusion This review found varied repeatability, reproducibility and sensitivity of exercise tests often resulting from inconsistencies in protocol administration (e.g. variations in protocols used, outcomes analysed, or protocol familiarisation). Such within- and between-test variations make comparisons difficult, even between studies ostensibly reporting the same test.

Quantifying this offset is an important part of commissioning. The aims of this study were to: 1) determine the reproducibility of the offset, 2) study the interobserver variation in the offset’s measurement, and 3) quantify the dosimetric impact of the offset. Offsets were measured for four ring applicators: two 30°, one 45°, and one 60°. Dwell positions were measured five times for each ring to determine the reproducibility of source positioning. Experiments were done to compare two separate source wires, as well as different time points within a single source wire’s lifecycle. Data were analyzed by three independent observers. To quantify the dosimetric impact of the offset, a treatment plan was generated using BrachyVision. The dose to point A, and the D2cc metric for rectum and bladder were calculated with and without the offset. For the 45° and 60° rings, measured offsets were 3.0mm and 3.6 mm, respectively. The 30° ring showed substantial variation in distal dwell positions (maximum difference between the five experiments of 2.9 mm). Subsequent testing of a replacement ring showed an offset of 2.4 mm that was more reproducible. Offsets varied less than 1 mm between different source wires, and changed less than 1 mm over the course of a source wire’s lifecycle. When comparing observers, the average range in a measurement of a dwell position was 0. 5mm (? = 0.2 mm, max 1.3 mm). The offset resulted in dose variations to point A, bladder, and rectum of less than 1%, 2%, and 5%, respectively. Results indicate that Varian rings can show systematic and random offsets of more than 3 mm. Some can be considered defective and should be replaced.

This paper looks at the current practice in the field relating to the citation and availability of both data and software methods. It is common to use widely available shared datasets in this field which helps to ensure that studies can be reproduced; however a brief survey of recent papers shows a wide range of styles of citation of data only some of which clearly identify the exact data used in the study. Similarly, practices in describing and sharing software artefacts vary considerably from detailed descriptions of algorithms to linked repositories. The Alveo Virtual Laboratory is a web based platform to support research based on collections of text, speech and video. Alveo provides a central repository for language data and provides a set of services for discovery and analysis of data. We argue that some of the features of the Alveo platform may make it easier for researchers to share their data more precisely and cite the exact software tools used to develop published results. Alveo makes use of ideas developed in other areas of science and we discuss these and how they can be applied to speech and language research.",WOS:000403510500020,COMPUTER SPEECH AND LANGUAGE

Materials and methods The accuracy of the SLS-2 was determined through multiple scans of a mannequin face model using both scanners. The reproducibility of a protocol for achieving consistent three-dimensional (3D) face scans in live subjects was carried out using the SLS-2. A precision of ≤1 mm was considered clinically significant. Results The mannequin face model was reproduced with no significant errors in the SLS-2 compared to the 3dMDtrio, with normally distributed data (mean = 0.002 mm; SD = 0.01 mm). In live subjects, the forehead, midface, chin and general face region showed mean errors and SD Conclusion Structured light scanning may be used for acquiring 3D face scans in live subjects in a radiation-free and reproducible manner, provided that the head of the subject is positioned in the same posture for each scan.

Here, we present an overview of data publication initiatives underway and the current conversation, highlighting points of consensus and issues still in contention. Data publication implementations differ in a variety of factors, including the kind of documentation, the location of the documentation relative to the data, and how the data is validated. Publishers may present data as supplemental material to a journal article, with a descriptive “data paper,” or independently. Complicating the situation, different initiatives and communities use the same terms to refer to distinct but overlapping concepts. For instance, the term published means that the data is publicly available and citable to virtually everyone, but it may or may not imply that the data has been peer-reviewed. In turn, what is meant by data peer review is far from defined; standards and processes encompass the full range employed in reviewing the literature, plus some novel variations. Basic data citation is a point of consensus, but the general agreement on the core elements of a dataset citation frays if the data is dynamic or part of a larger set. Even as data publication is being defined, some are looking past publication to other metaphors, notably “data as software,” for solutions to the more stubborn problems.","",""

The aim of this study was to evaluate intra- and inter-examiner reproducibility of probing depth (PD) measurements made with a manual probe. With the approval of an Ethics Committee, 20 individuals without periodontal disease were selected if they presented at least 6 teeth per quadrant. Using a Williams periodontal probe, three calibrated thesis-level students (k > 0.6) assessed PD at 6 sites per tooth, from the gingival margin to the bottom of the periodontal sulcus (rounded to the next 0.5 mm). Initial and repeated measurements were performed by the same three examiners. The intra-examiner agreement (± 1 mm > 90%) was 99.85%, 100%, and 100% for the three examiners, respectively. When the variables vestibular/lingual surfaces, mesial/distal surfaces, or superior/inferior jaws were evaluated, no significant differences in reproducibility were detected at the inter-examiner level (p < 0.05). At this level, the only significant differences observed were in the three examiners' measurements of the anterior and posterior sites. While high intra-examiner reproducibility was detected, inter-examiner level proved to be low. We can conclude that measurement of PD with a manual periodontal probe produced high reproducibility in healthy individuals. The operator's position can affect the reproducibility of repeated measures of PD. Calibration and operator training, rather than operator experience, were fundamental for reproducibility. Other factors, such as individual technique and probing depth force, can affect inter-examiner reproducibility.","",""

However, current methods for assessing Hi-C data reproducibility can produce misleading results because they ignore spatial features in Hi-C data, such as domain structure and distance dependence. We present HiCRep, a framework for assessing the reproducibility of Hi-C data that systematically accounts for these features. In particular, we introduce a novel similarity measure, the stratum adjusted correlation coefficient (SCC), for quantifying the similarity between Hi-C interaction matrices. Not only does it provide a statistically sound and reliable evaluation of reproducibility, SCC can also be used to quantify differences between Hi-C contact matrices and to determine the optimal sequencing depth for a desired resolution. The measure consistently shows higher accuracy than existing approaches in distinguishing subtle differences in reproducibility and depicting interrelationships of cell lineages. The proposed measure is straightforward to interpret and easy to compute, making it well-suited for providing standardized, interpretable, automatable, and scalable quality control.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can resolve tissue orientation but is blind to crossing fibers. Many advanced diffusion-weighted magnetic resolution imaging (MRI) approaches have been presented to extract crossing-fibers from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI), but the relative sensitivity and specificity of approaches remains unclear. Here, we examine two leading approaches (PAS and q-ball) in the context of a large-scale, single subject reproducibility study. A single healthy individual was scanned 11 times with 96 diffusion weighted directions and 10 reference volumes for each of five b-values (1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000 s/mm2) for a total of 5830 volumes (over the course of three sessions). We examined the reproducibility of the number of fibers per voxel, volume fraction, and crossing-fiber angles. For each method, we determined the minimum resolvable angle for each acquisition. Reproducibility of fiber counts per voxel was generally high (~80% consensus for PAS and ~70% for q-ball), but there was substantial bias between individual repetitions and model estimated with all data (~10% lower consensus for PAS and ~15% lower for q-ball). Both PAS and q-ball predominantly discovered fibers crossing at near 90 degrees, but reproducibility was higher for PAS across most measures. Within voxels with low anisotropy, q-ball finds more intra-voxel structure; meanwhile, PAS resolves multiple fibers at greater than 75 degrees for more voxels.

The reproducibility of relative locations has been analyzed in terms of existence and uniqueness of the inverse problem’s solution, and in connection with data completeness and the influence of noise on it.",WOS:000343129800003,ACTA GEOPHYSICA

The retraction of numerous studies from a wide range of disciplines, from climate science to bioscience, has drawn the focus of many commentators, but there exists a wider socio-cultural problem that pervades the scientific community. Sharing code, data and models often requires extra effort, this is currently seen as a significant overhead that may not be worth the time investment. Automated systems, which allow easy reproduction of results, offer the potential to incentives a culture change and drive the adoption of new techniques to improve the efficiency of scientific exploration. In this paper, we discuss the value of improved access and sharing of the two key types of results arising from work done in the computational sciences: models and algorithms. We propose the development of an integrated cloud-based system underpinning computational science, linking together software and data repositories, tool chains, workflows and outputs, providing a seamless automated infrastructure for the verification and validation of scientific models and in particular, performance benchmarks.","",""

At the current stage, Open Access has become such a global issue that it is critical for all involved in scholarly publishing, including policymakers, publishers, research funders, governments, learned societies, librarians, and academic communities, to be well-informed on the history, benefits, and pitfalls of Open Access. In spite of this, there is a general lack of consensus regarding the potential pros and cons of Open Access at multiple levels. This review aims to be a resource for current knowledge on the impacts of Open Access by synthesizing important research in three major areas: academic, economic and societal. While there is clearly much scope for additional research, several key trends are identified, including a broad citation advantage for researchers who publish openly, as well as additional benefits to the non-academic dissemination of their work. The economic impact of Open Access is less well-understood, although it is clear that access to the research literature is key for innovative enterprises, and a range of governmental and non-governmental services. Furthermore, Open Access has the potential to save both publishers and research funders considerable amounts of financial resources, and can provide some economic benefits to traditionally subscription-based journals. The societal impact of Open Access is strong, in particular for advancing citizen science initiatives, and leveling the playing field for researchers in developing countries. Open Access supersedes all potential alternative modes of access to the scholarly literature through enabling unrestricted re-use, and long-term stability independent of financial constraints of traditional publishers that impede knowledge sharing. However, Open Access has the potential to become unsustainable for research communities if high-cost options are allowed to continue to prevail in a widely unregulated scholarly publishing market. Open Access remains only one of the multiple challenges that the scholarly publishing system is currently facing. Yet, it provides one foundation for increasing engagement with researchers regarding ethical standards of publishing and the broader implications of 'Open Research'.","",""

This article asks why, and investigates whether conceptually replicating an effect in the original publication is related to the success of independent, direct replications. Two prominent accounts of low reproducibility make different predictions in this respect. One account suggests that psychological phenomena are dependent on unknown contexts that are not reproduced in independent replication attempts. By this account, internal replications indicate that a finding is more robust and, thus, that it is easier to independently replicate it. An alternative account suggests that researchers employ questionable research practices (QRPs), which increase false positive rates. By this account, the success of internal replications may just be the result of QRPs and, thus, internal replications are not predictive of independent replication success. The data of a large reproducibility project support the QRP account: replicating an effect in the original publication is not related to independent replication success. Additional analyses reveal that internally replicated and internally unreplicated effects are not very different in terms of variables associated with replication success. Moreover, social psychological effects in particular appear to lack any benefit from internal replications. Overall, these results indicate that, in this dataset at least, the influence of QRPs is at the heart of failures to replicate psychological findings, especially in social psychology. Variable, unknown contexts appear to play only a relatively minor role. I recommend practical solutions for how QRPs can be avoided.",WOS:000385152900033,PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW

Its initial version is built around the JEG-Hybrid database of HEVC coded video sequences. The framework is modular, organized in the form of pipelined activities, which range from the tools needed to generate the whole database from reference signals up to the analysis of the video quality measures already present in the database. Researchers can re-run, modify and extend any module, starting from any point in the pipeline, while always achieving perfect reproducibility of the results. The modularity of the structure allows to work on subsets of the database since for some analysis this might be too computationally intensive. To this purpose, the framework also includes a software module to compute interesting subsets, in terms of coding conditions, of the whole database. An example shows how the framework can be used to investigate how the small differences in the definition of the widespread PSNR metric can yield very different results, discussed in more details in our accompanying research paper Aldahdooh et al. (0000). This further underlines the importance of reproducibility to allow comparing different research work with high confidence. To the best of our knowledge, this framework is the first attempt to bring exact reproducibility end-to-end in the context of video quality evaluation research.","",""

The lack of reproducibility of preclinical research is a significant and growing problem which slows basic research and leads to fruitless clinical trials. An increasing number of reports have found discrepancies in published preclinical studies across scientific disciplines. For example:

* Amgen found that 47 of 53 “landmark” oncology publications could not be reproduced.

* Bayer found that their internal results contradicted academic publications in 43 of 67 oncology and cardiovascular projects.

* Dr. John Ioannidis and his colleagues found that of 432 publications purporting sex differences in hypertension, multiple sclerosis, or lung cancer, only one data set was reproducible.

These studies, and the many others that report similar results, highlight a significant problem in the development of new therapies to treat disease. With increasing reports of discrepancies in preclinical publications, pharmaceutical companies are being forced to re-evaluate their reliance on academic research. In fact, Bayer recently decided to halt nearly two-thirds of target-validation projects.In this session, we'll report the work we have done to address this issue. We will bring together researchers and representatives from funders and publishers to discuss the issue of reproducibility. We will share funder and publisher initiatives to promote reproducibility and also discuss research practices that lead to more reproducible research such as using proper statistical tests, reporting all experimental data, experimental blinding, and identification and validation of research reagents. We'll also share preliminary results from an Arnold Foundation-funded study to replicate the 50 most high impact cancer biology studies from 2010-1012.

Spatial properties of individual localization behavior can be represented in the form of perceptual maps. Individual differences in these maps may reflect properties of internal body representations, and perceptual maps may therefore be a useful method for studying these representations. For this to be the case, individual perceptual maps need to be reproducible, which has not yet been demonstrated. We assessed the reproducibility of localizations measured twice on subsequent days. Ten subjects participated in the experiments. Non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli were applied at seven sites on the lower arm. Subjects localized the stimuli on a photograph of their own arm, which was presented on a tablet screen overlaying the real arm. Reproducibility was assessed by calculating intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) for the mean localizations of each electrode site and the slope and offset of regression models of the localizations, which represent scaling and displacement of perceptual maps relative to the stimulated sites. The ICCs of the mean localizations ranged from 0.68 to 0.93; the ICCs of the regression parameters were 0.88 for the intercept and 0.92 for the slope. These results indicate a high degree of reproducibility. We conclude that localization patterns of non-painful electrocutaneous stimuli on the arm are reproducible on subsequent days. Reproducibility is a necessary property of perceptual maps for these to reflect properties of a subject’s internal body representations.

Quantifying this offset is an important part of commissioning. The aims of this study were to 1) determine the reproducibility of offsets, 2) study the inter‐observer variation in the measurement, and 3) quantify the dosimetric impact. Method and Materials: Offsets were measured for 4 ring applicators. Applicators were taped to a piece of film and exposed on a simulator. An HDR plan with 10 dwells (1cm spacing) was delivered. The resulting image shows delivered dwell positions superimposed on the ring's lumen. Using this technique, dwell positions were measured five times for each ring to determine the reproducibility of source positioning. Data were analyzed by two independent observers. A cervical treatment plan was used to quantify the dosimetric impact of the offsets. Results: For the 45 and 60 degree rings, measured offsets were 3.0mm and 3.6mm, respectively. The 30 degree ring showed substantial variation in distal dwell positions (maximum difference between experiments of 2.9mm), and was replaced by the vendor. Subsequent testing of the new ring showed an offset of 2.4mm that was more reproducible. When comparing observers, the average difference in measured dwell positions was 0.04mm (StDev = 0.4mm, max 1.3mm). Dosimetric consequences were generally small. Point A, bladder, and rectum doses varied by less than 1%, 2%, and 5%, respectively. Conclusion: Results indicate that Varian rings can show systematic and random offsets of >3mm. Some can be considered defective and should be replaced. Each applicator should be individually commissioned and reproducibility should be confirmed with multiple tests. Inter‐observer variability in the determination of dwell positions was less than 1.3mm. Offsets translated to < 5% variation in dose to critical structures, which is less than vendor‐reported results (up to 20% variation).",WOS:000411510000021,MEDICAL PHYSICS

These articles received a score by a large number of externally appointed referees in the context of the Italian research assessment exercise (VQR); similarly, journal scores were assigned in a panel-based independent assessment, which involved all academic journals in which Italian scholars have published, carried out under a different procedure. The score of an article is compared with that of the journal it is published in: more specifically, we first estimate an ordered probit model, assessing the probability for a paper of receiving a higher score, the higher the score of the journal; in a second step, we concentrate on the top papers, evaluating the probability of a paper receiving an excellent score having been published in a top-rated journal. In doing so, we control for a number of characteristics of the paper and its author, including the language of publication, the scientific field and its size, the age of the author and the academic status.

Variables obtained from virtual bone surfaces also need to be sufficiently repeatable and reproducible to be valid for anthropological studies. This is also true for the landmarks defining these variables and for their acquisition. The consistency between variables taken directly from dry bones and from the virtual surfaces of dry bones was tested on 40 clavicles. 30 virtual surfaces of iliae, fifth lumbar vertebrae, and clavicles reconstructed from computed tomography scans of living individuals were used to test the repeatability and reproducibility of 16 landmarks and 19 variables. Statistical tests, graphical and quantitative error evaluations, and intraclass correlation coefficients were applied. The differences between all variables taken on dry and virtual clavicles were less than ±1 mm. Bland–Altman plots showed more than 95% reliability between variables obtained on dry bone and their virtually reconstructed surfaces, confirming their consistency and thus validating their use in osteometric studies independently of the medium of study. Although not all landmarks were repeatable and reproducible, most variables were. To assess intra- or inter-observer errors, graphical representations or coefficients are more precise and accurate than statistical tests. These two evaluation methods should be given priority to test the repeatability and reproducibility of osteometric variables.","",""

The current national information service structures are characterized by alliance constraints and lock-in phenomena that effectively block the development of state -of-the-art data infrastructures. A possible solution could be the return to the principle of openness that used to be at the heart of the concept of libraries as institutions of education and enlightenment. Ideally, shared values imply similar technological frameworks and lead to a complementary network of individual activities and services. Up to now the emancipatory quality of the Semantic Web has largely been underestimated. It could help, however, put an end to the trench warfare raging between proponents and detractors of the principle of digitisation. The authors suggest that libraries assume the role of stewards of openness and fight for free, unrestricted and global access to processable scientific information. Taking the example of data infrastructures, they discuss concrete further steps on the way to Open Science.

However, as a data-driven approach, ICA could potentially serve as an exploratory tool at multi-subject level, and help us uncover inter-subject differences in patterns of connectivity (e.g., find subtypes in patient populations). In this work, we propose a methodology named gRAICAR that exploits the data-driven nature of ICA to allow discovery of sub-groupings of subjects based on reproducibility of their ICA components. This technique allows us not only to find highly reproducible common components across subjects but also to explore (without a priori subject groupings) components that could classify all subjects into sub-groups. gRAICAR generalizes the reproducibility framework previously developed for single subjects (Ranking and averaging independent component analysis by reproducibility-RAICAR-Yang et al., Hum Brain Mapp, 2008) to multiple-subject analysis. For each group-level component, gRAICAR generates its reproducibility matrix and further computes two metrics, inter-subject consistency and intra-subject reliability, to characterize inter-subject variability and reflect contributions from individual subjects. Nonparametric tests are employed to examine the significance of both the inter-subject consistency and the separation of subject groups reflected in the component. Our validations based on simulated and experimental resting-state fMRI datasets demonstrated the advantage of gRAICAR in extracting features reflecting potential subject groupings. It may facilitate discovery of the underlying brain functional networks with substantial potential to inform our understandings of development, neurodegenerative conditions, and psychiatric disorders.

Statistical power, P values, and the expected prevalence of false discoveries",0,"Abstract There is a clear perception in the literature that there is a crisis in reproducibility in the biomedical sciences. Many underlying factors contributing to the prevalence of irreproducible results have been highlighted with a focus on poor design and execution of experiments along with the misuse of statistics. While these factors certainly contribute to irreproducibility, relatively little attention outside of the specialized statistical literature has focused on the expected prevalence of false discoveries under idealized circumstances. In other words, when everything is done correctly, how often should we expect to be wrong? Using a simple simulation of an idealized experiment, it is possible to show the central role of sample size and the related quantity of statistical power in determining the false discovery rate, and in accurate estimation of effect size. According to our calculations, based on current practice many subfields of biomedical science may expect their discoveries to be false at least 25% of the time, and the only viable course to correct this is to require the reporting of statistical power and a minimum of 80% power (1 − β = 0.80) for all studies.","",""

In the present paper, I propose an alternative system for conducting rigorous and replicable psychological investigations, which I describe as Exploring Small, Confirming Big. I begin with a critical evaluation of the merits of NHST and small-scale meta-analyses, and argue that NHST does have a valuable role in the scientific process, whereas small-scale meta-analyses will do little to advance a cumulative science. I then present an overview of an alternative system for producing cumulative and replicable psychological research: Exploring Small, Confirming Big. It involves a two-step process to psychological research, consisting of (1) small N investigation(s), in which psychologists use NHST to develop exploratory models; and (2) strong, confirmatory tests of exploratory models, by analyzing new and/or existing large N datasets with variables that capture the effect(s) of interest from the Exploring Small stage.

Although it has a significant clinical relevance, its importance is underestimated. It was Alexander Pope in 1732 who was first to understand the value of reproducibility, with his famous comment “Who shall decide when doctors disagree?”. Pope’s question concerns the medical doctors’ opinion on a patient’s status, which from a statistical point of view may be considered a categorical variable. However, the same question may be posed for continuous quantitative variables. Reproducibility is complementary to variability: the larger the variability, the lower the reproducibility, and vice versa. Thus, we can think at them as interchangeable, even thought statistical methods have been developed for the estimation of variability. The question now is “Why do we need to know the reproducibility of measurements? ”. The most important and simplest answer is that we need to know how reliable a measured value or a subjective judgment is before taking clinical decisions based on this measurement/judgment. Integrating this knowledge in clinical practice is a key aspect of evidence-based medicine.","",""

The effect of this posture on back surface parameters was also compared with two standard radiological postures. A back surface topography was performed on 46 patients (40 girls and 6 boys) with a minimum of 15° Cobb angle on coronal spinal radiographs. Inter-observer reliability was evaluated using the typical error measurement (TEM) and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). Variations between postures were assessed using a Student's t test. The inter-observer reproducibility is good enough for the three postures. The proposed posture leads to significant changes in the sagittal plane as well as in the identification of thoracic humps. This study shows the reproducibility of the proposed posture in order to explore the thoracic humps and highlights its relevance to explore scoliosis with back surface topography systems.,"",""

This study was approved by institutional ethics committee, and written informed consent was obtained. Twenty-two healthy volunteers underwent 2 examinations on different days. Each examination consisted of MR imaging on both 3-T and 1.5-T MR scanners. The data from both scanners and examination days were obtained, and QSM was calculated with STI Suite using 2 different algorithms--harmonic phase removal using laplacian operator (HARPERELLA) and a sophisticated harmonic artifact reduction for phase data (SHARP) method with a variable radius of the spherical kernel at the brain boundary (V-SHARP). We evaluated consistency of QSM between 3 T and 1.5 T and the reproducibility between the first and second examinations using 2-phase processing methods (HARPERELLA and V-SHARP). Susceptibility values of regions of interests at 3 T were highly correlated with those at 1.5 T with good agreement (HARPERELLA, R2 = 0.838; V-SHARP, R2 = 0.898) (average difference, ±1.96 SD; HARPERELLA, -0.012 ± 0.046; V-SHARP, -0.002 ± 0.034). Reproducibility analysis demonstrated excellent correlation between the first and second examination at both 3 T and 1.5 T for both algorithms (HARPERELLA at 3 T, R2 = 0.921; 1.5 T, R2 = 0.891; V-SHARP at 3 T, R2 = 0.937; 1.5 T, R2 = 0.926). Bland-Altman analysis showed excellent reproducibility for HARPERELLA (3 T, -0.003 ± 0.032; 1.5 T, -0.003 ± 0.038) and V-SHARP (3 T, -0.003 ± 0.027; 1.5 T, -0.003 ± 0.029). Susceptibility values of these 2 algorithms were highly correlated with good agreement (3T, R2 = 0.961; 1.5 T, R = 0.931) (3 T, 0.009 ± 0.023; 1.5 T, -0.003 ± 0.049).

Methods Thirty subjects had impressions taken of their teeth and rendered as stone casts. In addition, their mouths were scanned with the iOC and the scans were converted into digital models. Tooth widths were measured with a digital caliper from the physical models and with the OrthoCAD software from the virtual models. Bolton ratios were derived using the data from each method. Validity was assessed with a paired t test, reliability with the Pearson correlation coefficient, and reproducibility with the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results Although there were statistically significant differences between mean tooth widths ( P  = 0.0083) and Bolton ratios ( P  = 0.0354 and P r for tooth-width replications was 0.99 for both techniques, and all intraclass correlation coefficient values exceeded 87%.

Open Science is not new, it was the bedrock on which the scientific revolutions of the 18th and 19th centuries were built. Its open publication of scientific concepts and the evidence (the data) on which they were based allowed scrutiny of the logic of an argument and replication of observations or experiments or their refutation. It has been the basis of so-called “scientific self-correction”. But the technological revolution of recent decades has produced an unprecedented explosion in the human capacity to acquire, store and manipulate data and information and to instantaneously communicate them globally, irrespective of location. It has produced fundamental changes in human, social and economic behaviour and has implications for research and learning that are far more profound and pervasive than those that followed Gutenberg’s invention of the printing press, including the way that science engages with the wider community. But the explosion of data is also undermining self-correction through the difficulty of making large volumes of supporting data concurrently available in a scrutinisable form, risking both the method of science and its credibility. This poses a major challenge for modern science to stimulate open release and sharing of data in ways that also facilitate new modes of collaboration and that increase creativity through interaction of many brains and many communities unbounded by institutional walls. We need to challenge and re-define many of the habits and norms of researchers and their institutions if the research community if it is to exploit technological opportunities, maintain self-correction and maximize the contribution of research to human understanding and welfare. Fortunately the response to these imperatives is growing, through the enunciation of principles for open science, the development of procedures and tools and the engagement of researchers, universities, funders, publishers, learned societies and governments.","",""

Measurement of flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is well known as a noninvasive method for an assessment of vascular endothelial function. However, the reproducibility is a major issue of FMD measurement. The purpose of this study is to examine the reproducibility of the new FMD measurement with medial epicondyle method.



Methods

First, to evaluate the variability of the brachial artery diameter, 23 volunteers recruited from 32 healthy volunteers were examined for a brachial artery diameter at rest using with FMD equipment. Second, to evaluate the reproducibility of the FMD measurement, all volunteers underwent the FMD measurement, which was repeated at 2-week interval using the traditional method and the medial epicondyle method. The reproducibility in both methods was evaluated by 2 independent observers who measured on the same subject to assess the inter-observer reproducibility, and 1 observer who measured the same subject twice to assess the intra-observer reproducibility regarding the baseline value of arterial diameter and FMD.



Results

The variability of brachial artery diameter was 0.57 ± 0.27 mm in 23 healthy volunteers. In the study of inter- and intra-observer reproducibility, 2 parameters including intra-class correlation coefficient and Pearson's correlation coefficient by medial epicondyle method are superior to those by traditional method.



Conclusions

These results suggest that medial epicondyle methodological approach to measure FMD is superior to traditional method.",WOS:000330559100022,ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY-A JOURNAL OF CARDIOVASCULAR ULTRASOUND AND ALLIED TECHNIQUES

Over the last few years, this technique is mainly being developed in the field of maxillofacial reconstructive surgery, creating fusion images with computed tomography (CT) data for accurate planning and prediction of treatment outcome. However, in hand surgery, 3D photography is not yet being used in clinical settings. METHODS The aim of this study was to develop a valid method for imaging the hand using 3D stereophotogrammetry. The reproducibility of 30 soft tissue landmarks was determined using 3D stereophotogrammetric images. Analysis was performed by two observers on 20 3D photographs. Reproducibility and reliability of the landmark identification were determined using statistical analysis. RESULTS The intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the landmarks were high. This study showed a high reliability coefficient for intraobserver (1.00) and interobserver reliability (0.99). Identification of the landmarks on the palmar aspect of individual fingers was more precise than the identification of landmarks of the thumb. CONCLUSIONS This study shows that 3D photography can safely produce accurate and reproducible images of the hand, which makes the technique a reliable method for soft tissue analysis. 3D images can be a helpful tool in pre- and postoperative evaluation of reconstructive trauma surgery, in aesthetic surgery of the hand, and for educational purposes. The use in everyday practice of hand surgery and the concept of fusing 3D photography images with radiologic images of the interior hand structures needs to be further explored.",WOS:000353807700021,JOURNAL OF PLASTIC RECONSTRUCTIVE AND AESTHETIC SURGERY

In this study, reproducibility and intra- and inter-observer variability was assessed for offline analysis as well as echocardiography investigations. Also, we evaluated the importance of exact placement of the region of interest (ROI). Methods : TVI recordings from 21 fetuses, at a gestational age of 27 to 41 weeks, were acquired at 208-239 frames/s for subsequent offline analysis. All recordings were performed with the transducer positioned to provide an apical four-chamber view and the myocardial velocity data was obtained from basal inferoseptum. The data set was analyzed according to Bland-Altman and reproducibility was expressed as the standard error of a single determination, estimated from duplicate determinations in percentage of the total. Results : The variation of reproducibility for the echocardiography investigation ranged from 2.0% to 9.8%. The duration of left ventricular ejection, and the peak velocities of early diastolic filling and atrial contraction being the most robust events measured. The variation of inter-observer variability for the echocardiography investigation ranged from 1.5% to 8.4%, and the variation of intra- and inter-observer variability for the offline analysis ranged from 1.2% to 10.4%. Least robust were the events of shortest duration, including isovolumetric contraction and relaxation. Conclusion : We believe that TVI measurements of the fetal myocardium could be performed in the clinical routine with acceptable reproducibility.","",""

Three rounds of a proficiency testing scheme for airborne sound insulation measurements have been performed according to the methods specified in the standard for a whole facade by using an external loudspeaker as the noise source. The adequacy of the intercomparison is guaranteed by means of the assessment of global precision criteria in compliance with the scope stipulated by the normative references in order to determine the reproducibility limits in a regulated measurement method. To evaluate the participant performance, the corresponding combined scores as composite indexes are calculated, so if this assessment is performed along a certain number of rounds, it will remark the participants that show an overall satisfactory performance by monitoring their achievement over time. Therefore, in order to establish a reference value in terms of precision level, an approach based on the development of a collaborative test in controlled conditions is proposed. The goal is to provide reliable and updated criteria for the evaluation of repeatability and reproducibility limits in this field, particularly in those scopes in which nowadays there is no normative reference or this is very poor. Furthermore, these prescribed values of precision should be verified regularly, as well as the definition of practical conditions of application.",WOS:000358734000008,ACCREDITATION AND QUALITY ASSURANCE

In this paper, stimulated by the comments of John E. Madias on our paper ( J Electrocardiol , 2012), we further explored the consequences implied by the theoretical model. First, we verified the reproducibility of TWA measures, in clinically stable patients repeatedly tested. The sensitivity to displacement was evaluated simulating lead mislocations of up to 20mm. The numerical simulations were performed on data obtained solving the inverse electrocardiographically problem from three subjects (ECGSIM). The results showed that TWA sensitivity varies across leads, being maximal in V1 and decreases towards V6. Globally, the maximal percent error found was 6.1%. Thus, TWA measures do not seem to add more stringent requirements on lead placement's precision, than the usual diagnostic practice. Finally, we further discussed the implications of normalizing TWA measures. While clinical studies are necessary to sort out the issue, the theoretical model suggests that normalization might be appropriate only is certain cases.",WOS:000316837500019,JOURNAL OF ELECTROCARDIOLOGY

The Contextual Suggestion (CS) TREC track provides an evaluation framework for systems that recommend items to users given their geographical context. The specific nature of this track allows the participating teams to identify candidate documents either from the Open Web or from the ClueWeb12 collection, a static version of the web. In the judging pool, the documents from the Open Web and ClueWeb12 collection are distinguished. Hence, each system submission should be based only on one resource, either Open Web (identified by URLs) or ClueWeb12 (identified by ids). To achieve reproducibility, ranking web pages from ClueWeb12 should be the preferred method for scientific evaluation of CS systems, but it has been found that the systems that build their suggestion algorithms on top of input taken from the Open Web achieve consistently a higher effectiveness. Because most of the systems take a rather similar approach to making CSs, this raises the question whether systems built by researchers on top of ClueWeb12 are still representative of those that would work directly on industry-strength web search engines. Do we need to sacrifice reproducibility for the sake of representativeness? We study the difference in effectiveness between Open Web systems and ClueWeb12 systems through analyzing the relevance assessments of documents identified from both the Open Web and ClueWeb12. Then, we identify documents that overlap between the relevance assessments of the Open Web and ClueWeb12, observing a dependency between relevance assessments and the source of the document being taken from the Open Web or from ClueWeb12. After that, we identify documents from the relevance assessments of the Open Web which exist in the ClueWeb12 collection but do not exist in the ClueWeb12 relevance assessments. We use these documents to expand the ClueWeb12 relevance assessments. Our main findings are twofold. First, our empirical analysis of the relevance assessments of 2 years of CS track shows that Open Web documents receive better ratings than ClueWeb12 documents, especially if we look at the documents in the overlap. Second, our approach for selecting candidate documents from ClueWeb12 collection based on information obtained from the Open Web makes an improvement step towards partially bridging the gap in effectiveness between Open Web and ClueWeb12 systems, while at the same time we achieve reproducible results on well-known representative sample of the web.",WOS:000378540600002,INFORMATION RETRIEVAL JOURNAL

Organized as a global community with nonprofit offices in several U.S. states, Public Lab introduces a model of community science, which incorporates open source practices including transparent collaboration and iterative design, along with deliberative democratic governance, and practitioner empowerment through critical making supported by an open science network. Community science can enable community members to collect, interpret, and apply their own data to effect local change or participate in broader environmental research and decision-making. The authors conceptualize a tiered approach to project development, with tiers delineated by the scope of community objectives and the role of community science in achieving those objectives. Tier 1 includes performative science used to engage the public but without direct application toward community goals. Tier 2 involves community science created and conducted by members for community-relevant outcomes. Tier 3 incorporates institutional partners, building upon community data through collaborative process to achieve community goals with broader implications. Examples of Public Lab projects from each tier demonstrate the versatility of community science, and the potential opportunity for community science to facilitate public participation in environmental decision-making on multiple levels.

Paper discolouration in a single journal type, the Wagga Wagga Daily Advertiser published from the dates 1876–2004 was chosen as the focus of study, with a specific hypothesis to be tested; that the wartime journals were more discoloured by yellowing due to them being accessed more frequently. A series of measurements were carried out with a smartphone device using the camera to act as a colorimeter and converting the CIE L xy vector length into a yellowing parameter Y. A number of preliminary attempts were made to recreate conditions that corresponded to the measurements of Y using a conventional spectrophotometer, this was by standardising distance from object and through a number of lighting conditions. It was found that the most consistently comparable results (with an offset) could be obtained using an iPhone 6S with the light source from an additional iPhone with sample to aperture distance of 4 cm. Both studies showed that the large increase in Y occurred in journals printed around 1912 with a plateau of elevated Y value detected in journals until the 1950s after which the Y parameter decreased until 2004. This indicates the frequency access hypothesis to be false and this negative proof was able to be evidenced by the data collected by the iPhone. It would be suggested that great care needs to be taken if such an approach of stand-alone measurement were to be taken into citizen science; training and testing would need to be undertaken, because of the challenge of reproducibility and the risk of sampling irreplaceable objects.",WOS:000410412700001,HERITAGE SCIENCE

Dynamic loop scheduling (DLS) techniques are an effective approach towards performance improvement of scientific applications via load balancing. These techniques address algorithmic and systemic sources of load imbalance by dynamically assigning tasks to processing elements. The DLS techniques have demonstrated their effectiveness when applied in real applications. Complementing native experiments, simulation is a powerful tool for studying the behavior of parallel and distributed applications. This work is a comprehensive reproducibility study of experiments using DLS techniques published in earlier literature to verify their implementations into SimGrid-MSG. In earlier work, it was shown that having a detailed degree of information regarding the experiments to be reproduced is essential for a successful reproduction. This work concentrates on the reproduction of experiments with variable application behaviour and high degree of parallelism of applications and systems. It is shown that reproducing measurements of applications with high variance in task execution times is challenging, albeit feasible and useful. The success of the present reproducibility study signifies the fact that the implementation of the DLS techniques in SimGrid-MSG is verified for the considered applications and systems. Thus, it enables well-founded future research using the DLS techniques in simulation.","",""

A major problem in photobiomodulation (PBM) is the lack of proper reporting of the involved parameters and, further to that, the control of the parameters. Too often, the reporting of the parameters used in a study is incomplete, and the use of specific parameters is ad hoc. Parameters seem to be those of the equipment at hand, rather than being chosen specifically to, for example, replicate those used in a previous study or fall within an already-known effective range applicable to current work. This lack of quality control among too many researchers and scientific journals creates an obstacle in finding reproducibility in meta-analyses. Frequently, such efforts end up with the conclusion that no definite conclusion can be made, because of the great variety in the reported parameters, no matter how many positive studies there are.

Researchers do not have to stick to parameters used in other studies; they are free and encouraged to explore all the available parameters within the supposed therapeutic window. Without a full and correct reporting of all pertinent light source parameters, however, nobody can perform a control study even of the best studies. What is needed is a close cooperation between researchers and journals. The definition of light parameters is only basic physics, and no guesswork is required. However, researchers in the PBM field generally come from professions for which physics has not been on the curriculum. Although they are very qualified in their own professional field, they may lack understanding of PBM. Our suggestion is to include a physicist on the team to make sure that the actual “medicine” to be tested is not flawed before the study even has begun.

The majority of submitted articles have to undergo one or several revisions before being accepted; however, often the parameters are still incorrect or incomplete upon publication. Therefore, solving the problem requires vigilance and action at multiple levels. Reviewers must assess the reported parameters and request revision where they do not meet the requirements of the journal; and journal editors and staff must ensure that only articles that meet their stated standards are published. And it is important not to forget the obligation of manufacturers to report the parameters of their devices accurately and honestly, and to refrain from highlighting factors that sound good in marketing materials but that lend little to the utility of the device and/or reproducibility of outcomes. Ultimately, however, it is the author who is charged with the fundamental responsibility, to first obtain and then report an accurate and complete set of parameters, thus ensuring that the work may be reproduced and, therefore, add to the overall body of knowledge. In other words, it is the author's responsibility to produce good science.

The most flawed parameters are the energy (J) and the dose (J/cm2). Too often, only one of them is reported, but both need to be within the so-called therapeutic window. A seemingly reasonable dose may just be the effect of a thin fiber,2 and a high energy may be dispersed over a large area, thus resulting in a low dose.3 Qualified readers of an article may be able to calculate what is missing if other parameters such as the spot size (cm2) is reported. However, anyone should be able to have access to all the necessary parameters. Jenkins and Carroll4 proposed a tabular format for reporting parameters in a clear, concise, comprehensive, and standardized manner.

Tables 1–3 show the work of some fictional authors, Smith et al., who use the tabular method to include necessary detail for their treatment of carpal tunnel syndrome.

Treatment Parameters



Although the inclusion of all these parameters would significantly improve the quality of research, the complexity of the light parameters often requires the inclusion of details such as the polarization, shape, profile, and divergence of the beam, and – for switched/pulsed beams – the frequency, pulse duration, duty cycle, and waveform. Such details should be available to authors from the equipment manufacturer or as a product of in-house and/or independent measurement and testing.

In the Abstract to their article, our fictional authors Smith et al. write that “…an 810 nm, 100 mW continuous wave laser, spot size 0.5 cm2, was placed in contact with the skin and firm pressure applied. Three points over the transverse carpal ligament were irradiated for 40 sec each, delivering 4 J (8 J/cm2) per point, for a total energy of 12 J per session. Laser irradiation was performed once daily for 5 days, with the total energy delivered being 60 J.” This is quite a comprehensive summary of the important parameters, and – although not a complete list – practically sufficient within itself to allow the laser irradiation aspect of this study to be accurately reproduced.

At the very least, these are the parameters that should be included in the Abstract. The majority of readers of a study actually only read the PubMed abstract, and abstracts with incorrect or omitted parameters can be misleading. The creation of “PubMed Commons” offers an opportunity for researchers and readers to add pertinent information about studies being incomplete or flawed; however, we should not rely on this to remedy such fundamental errors and omissions.

Being meticulous about the reporting of light parameters is mandatory but not sufficient. When information about previous studies in the area, in the Introduction and the Discussion, is added, readers are often left in the dark. With the great variation in the possible combinations of light parameters, apples and bananas are too frequently compared. Our suggestion is to include the most important parameters when referring to other studies. For example, Jones et al. (810 nm, 100 mW, 3 points ×4 J [8 J/cm2] per point, 12 J total, 1× daily ×5 days). Such writing will make it possible for a reader to understand the relevance of the reference in its context.

On the subject of references, we can see room for improvement. References of very old articles can be justified as historical references. However, with ∼20 PBM articles in PubMed in 2000 and 4200 in 2016, it is obvious that literature reviews and meta-analyses from the 1990s are less relevant.

Finally, there must be an end to the nomenclature confusion. The topic has been discussed in this journal before,5 and the implementation of a common nomenclature is important for “outsiders” to understand what we are talking about.

PBM has been used for >50 years, and no serious side effects have been reported. In a decade when side effects of pharmaceuticals are alarming and antibiotic resistance is a threat, this treatment modality appears to be much needed in the medical armamentarium, but first the scientific strength needs to be increased, and this can only occur if the basic use and reporting of light parameters are improved.",WOS:000371872600001,PHOTOMEDICINE AND LASER SURGERY

Moreover, many modern statistical methods make use of ‘random walk’ model fitting procedures, and these are inherently stochastic in their output. Does the combination of these statistical procedures and current standards of data archiving and method reporting permit the reproduction of the authors' results? To test this, we reanalysed data sets gathered from papers using the software package structure to identify genetically similar clusters of individuals. We find that reproducing structure results can be difficult despite the straightforward requirements of the program. Our results indicate that 30% of analyses were unable to reproduce the same number of population clusters. To improve this, we make recommendations for future use of the software and for reporting structure analyses and results in published works.",WOS:000309888200004,MOLECULAR ECOLOGY

Methods Twenty-eight subjects (heart failure stages A–C, 61% with QRS ≥ 120 ms, ejection fraction (EF) ≤35%) underwent two consecutive echo-studies within 24 h to evaluate test–re-test reproducibility of inter-ventricular electromechanical delay (VV delay, by traditional pulsed-Doppler), and intra-LV electromechanical delay between opposite LV walls by color-coded Doppler tissue-velocity (COLOR-DTI), and by pulsed-Doppler tissue spectrum (PW-DTI). Reproducibility of LV internal diastolic diameter (LVIDD) and of EF (by Simpson's method) assessments was evaluated contextually for reference. Results Intra-study and inter-study reproducibility of inter-ventricular and intra-LV electromechanical dyssynchrony was in general good, and comparable to the reproducibility of LVIDD and EF assessments. Between-study reproducibility of PW-TDI method was fair, but showed poor agreement with COLOR-TDI method. In repeated studies, agreement of significant electromechanical delay by COLOR-TDI was comparable to the agreement of EF ≤ 35%. In the 5 patients who had simultaneously large QRS, EF ≤ 35%, and significant inter- and intra-ventricular dyssynchrony at study #1, 3 had EF 36–40% and 1 showed no significant dyssynchrony by study #2. Conclusion In serial echocardiographic studies, Doppler echocardiography showed a good test–re-test reproducibility for the identification of significant electromechanical delay. Planimetry for EF assessment was a source of variability as relevant as Doppler echocardiography, but COLOR-DTI may add meaningful and reproducible information to QRS duration for cardiac-resynchronization therapy.",WOS:000284292700003,JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY

Therefore, we performed a small sample size study (n = 5) to investigate quantitative criteria for reproducible PTT measurement. The inflection point as a characteristic feature of the pulse wave showed the most stabile results under varying conditions.

Previous studies show considerable variation in amplitude and spatial extent of fMRI activation across repeated sessions on individual subjects even using identical experimental paradigms and imaging conditions. Most existing fMRI reproducibility studies were typically limited by time duration and data analysis techniques. Particularly, the assessment of reproducibility is complicated by a fact that fMRI results may depend on data analysis techniques used in reproducibility studies. In this work, the long-term fMRI reproducibility was investigated with a focus on the data analysis methods. Two spatial smoothing techniques, including a wavelet-domain Bayesian method and the Gaussian smoothing, were evaluated in terms of their effects on the long-term reproducibility. A multivariate support vector machine SVM-based method was used to identify active voxels, and compared to a widely used general linear model GLM-based method at the group level. The reproducibility study was performed using multisession fMRI data acquired from eight healthy adults over 1.5 years' period of time. Three regions-of-interest ROI related to a motor task were defined based upon which the long-term reproducibility were examined. Experimental results indicate that different spatial smoothing techniques may lead to different reproducibility measures, and the wavelet-based spatial smoothing and SVM-based activation detection is a good combination for reproducibility studies. On the basis of the ROIs and multiple numerical criteria, we observed a moderate to substantial within-subject long-term reproducibility. A reasonable long-term reproducibility was also observed from the inter-subject study. It was found that the short-term reproducibility is usually higher than the long-term reproducibility. Furthermore, the results indicate that brain regions with high contrast-to-noise ratio do not necessarily exhibit high reproducibility. These findings may provide supportive information for optimal design/implementation of fMRI studies and data interpretation.",WOS:000345308500008,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF IMAGING SYSTEMS AND TECHNOLOGY

Accuracy and reproducibility of the employed measuring method were determined. Methods An acrylic model of a lower left first molar was prepared to receive a partial crown and duplicated by single step dual viscosity impressions. Corresponding working casts were formed from Type IV die stone and indirect restorations were fabricated from heat-pressable lithium disilicate ceramics (IPS e.max Press, Ivoclar Vivadent AG, Schaan, Liechtenstein). The acrylic tooth model and the ceramic partial crowns were digitized by a structure light scanner with a measurement-uncertainty of 4 μm and subjected to computer-aided quality inspection. Visual discrepancies in marginal and internal fit were displayed with colors. For quantitative analysis, mean quadratic deviations (RMS) were computed and analyzed by Student's t -test ( n  = 5, α  = 0.05). Results Mean RMS-values for accuracy (reproducibility) ranged from 34 (14) μm for internal areas to 78 (23) μm for marginal surfaces.

Many recent studies, however, describe a reproducibility crisis and call for assessments of reproducibility across scientific domains. Here, we explore the reproducibility of a classic ecological experiment—that of assessing female host plant preference and acceptance in phytophagous insects, a group in which host specialization is a key driver of diversification. We exposed multiple cohorts of Pieris napi butterflies from the same population to traditional host acceptance and preference tests on three Brassicaceae host species. Whereas the host plant rank order was highly reproducible, the propensity to oviposit on low-ranked hosts varied significantly even among cohorts exposed to similar conditions. Much variation could be attributed to among-cohort variation in female fecundity, a trait strongly correlated both to female size and to the size of the nuptial gift a female receives during mating. Small males provide small spermatophores, and in our experiment small females that mated with small males had a disproportionally low propensity to oviposit on low-ranked hosts. Hence, our results provide empirical support to the theoretical prediction that female host utilization is strongly affected by non-genetic, environmental variation, and that such variation can affect the reproducibility of ecological experiments even under seemingly identical conditions.",WOS:000395893200013,PROCEEDINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY B-BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES

Methods Four different occlusal tables were created: two of 120° represented by an artificial inferior first molar either embedded in a periodontal‐ligament‐simulator or not; one of 100° (simulating the occlusion of anterior teeth) and a plane surface (180°) in static and variable positions. Three levels of force (10 N, 50 N and 150 N) were applied, 40 times each, by a universal testing machine (Autograph ® , AG‐I) with a spherical bur (diameter = 2.2 mm) on the sensor film. One‐way ANOVAs with Bonferroni corrections for post hoc tests were used for multiple comparisons. Results According to our study, 85% of the outliers are within the 5 first closures, representing the conditioning time required by the initially flat sensor. Graphically and statistically sustained differences ( p Conclusions An undeniable improvement of the T‐Scan ® III HD system as compared to former designs could be shown. The anatomic circumstances did not influence the sensor's sensibility or reproducibility. However, further studies on the varying sensitivity throughout its sensing surface are required.

This study aimed to analyze the reproducibility, repeatability and level of difficulty of two methods for tumor budding evaluation in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC): staining by hematoxylin and eosin (HE), and immunostaining for multi-cytokeratin.

Methods
The evaluation of tumor budding was performed by three examiners in 103 samples of OSCC, using the two methods. A Likert-type scale was used to measure the difficulty in the assessment. The inter-examiner agreement (reproducibility) was estimated using Fleiss's Kappa and the intra-examiner agreement (repeatability) was estimated using Cohen's Kappa. The Friedman test was used to compare the three examiners’ perceived levels of difficulty of assessment. The Wilcoxon test was used to compare the level of difficulty of the evaluation between the two methods.

Results
Reproducibility by the immunostaining method for multi-cytokeratin was substantial, being higher than the only fair agreement by the HE. Repeatability by the HE ranged from moderate to substantial among examiners, regardless of the examiner's experience. Repeatability by the immunostaining method for multi-cytokeratin did not vary among examiners, showing almost perfect agreement. The agreement between the two methods ranged from fair to moderate among examiners, being lower in the less experienced examiner. All the examiners presented greater difficulty in the evaluation by the HE.

Conclusion
In view of the unsatisfactory agreement between the two methods of tumor budding evaluation in OSCC, it is recommended that this evaluation should be performed by the immunostaining method for multi-cytokeratin, considering its higher reproducibility, greater replicability and lower difficulty compared to the HE.

The analysis included an assessment of validity (comparison with the results of the 3-day dietary record) and of reproducibility (comparison of the results obtained twice—FFQ1 and FFQ2). In the analysis of validity, a Bland-Altman index of 5.5% and 4.4% was recorded, respectively for FFQ1 and FFQ2.

Design Retrospective, observational case series. Participants Five glaucoma subspecialists from 5 different academic medical centers. Methods Five visual field tests from each of 100 eyes of 83 patients being monitored for glaucoma were retrospectively identified and subjectively and independently evaluated by the 5 glaucoma subspecialists. Each set of visual fields was classified regarding progression as \"none,\" \"questionable,\" \"probable,\" or \"definite.\" More than 1 month later, the same expert observers reevaluated the same sets of visual field tests to allow determination of intraobserver reproducibility. A final subjective evaluation regarding progression was performed 3 months later, at which time the expert observers had access to the GPA printout. Main Outcome Measures The level of interobserver agreement and intraobserver reproducibility was estimated using kappa statistics on the raw classification data and also on dichotomized data in which \"none\" and \"questionable\" progression were reclassified together as nonprogressed and \" probable\" and \"definite\" were reclassified as progressed. Results Intraobserver reproducibility was good to excellent (kappa = 0.62–0.78) for the raw data and moderate to good (kappa = 0.58–0.71) for the dichotomized data. Interobserver agreement was moderate (kappa = 0.45; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.35–0.55) for the raw classification data and also for dichotomized data (kappa = 0.55; 95% CI, 0.46–0.64). Access to the GPA printout did not significantly change the level of interobserver agreement. Conclusions Five glaucoma experts had good to excellent reproducibility of the determination of visual field progression compared with earlier evaluation of the same field sets. Agreement among the experts with each other was only moderate, and did not improve when each had access to GPA results.

There is an emerging consensus among the members of the academic research community that the practices of this new science paradigm should be congruent with “open science”. This entails that the bonanza of research data, the wide availability of algorithms, data tools, and data services produced by the members of the research community must be discoverable, understandable, and usable by overcoming all kinds of heterogeneity and logical inconsistencies. The main concept for coping with the many dimensions of heterogeneity and logical inconsistency is mediation. Mediation is achieved by mediators or brokers. These are software modules that exploit encoded knowledge about certain datasets, data services, and user needs in order to implement an intermediary service. A mediating environment is an environment that provides a core set of intermediary services. Mediation should be a distinct functionality of future research data infrastructures. This paper surveys the different levels of interoperability, i.e., exchangeability, compatibility, and usability, their properties and relationships, mediation concepts, functions, and intermediary services. The current interoperability landscape is also illustrated. Finally, the paper advocates the need for mediating environments to be supported by future research data infrastructures and envisions that one of the most important features of future research data infrastructures will be mediation software.","",""

Among the several phenomena affecting the reproducibility those related to imperfect experimental design are sometimes dominant. In this work an experimental design centered on a pattern of short-time repeated exposures (STE) to gases is presented as a method to increase the reproducibility of sensors responses. The method was validated in a experiment where an array of metalloporphyrins coated quartz microbalances is used to classify two volatile compounds and their mixture. The experiment was designed in order to compare the performance of the proposed method with that achieved with the standard long-time gas exposures. The STE results show an improvement of the reproducibility of the sensorial system respect to the standard protocol providing a complete identification after 45 days from the training procedure. The results also evidence the fundamental role of the first exposure to improve the reproducibility of the other pulses responses composing STE pattern.,WOS:000292354600036,SENSORS AND ACTUATORS B-CHEMICAL

Despite this concern, research has shown that replications of previously published work comprise a very small proportion of published studies. Moreover, there are fewer published direct replications of research studies by independent investigators, and this type of replication is much less likely to confirm the results of the original research than are replications by the original investigator or conceptual replications. A search of the communication disorders research literature reveals that direct replications by independent investigators are virtually non-existent. The purpose of this project was to describe the major issues related to research reproducibility and report the results of a direct replication of a study by Locke (1972) regarding ease of articulation. Two methods for rating ease of articulation were employed. We were able to reproduce the results of the original study for the first method, obtaining a moderate positive correlation between our rankings of phoneme difficulty and Locke’s rankings. We obtained a very high positive correlation between our phoneme rankings and rankings obtained in the original study for the second method. Moreover, we found a higher correlation between difficulty rankings and order of speech sound acquisition for American English than was found in the original study.

Animals studied  Freshly enucleated healthy eyes of 44 free-ranging birds of prey out of the species Haliaeetus albicilla, Accipiter gentilis, Accipiter nisus, Buteo buteo, Falco tinnunculus, Strix aluco, Asio otus and Tyto alba euthanized because of unrelated health problems.



Procedures  IOP readings from the TonoVet® were compared with a manometric device, with IOP being set from 5 to 100 mmHg in steps of 5 mmHg by adjusting the height of a NaCl solution reservoir connected to the eye. Reproducibility of the TonoVet® readings was determined by repeated measurements.



Results  TonoVet® and manometer values showed a strong linear correlation. In the Accipitridae, the TonoVet® tended to increasingly overestimate IOP with increasing pressure, while in the other families, it increasingly underestimated it. In the Sparrowhawk, the values almost represent the ideal line. Reproducibility of TonoVet® values decreases with increasing pressure in the clinically important range from 5 to 60 mmHg.



Conclusion  IOP values measured with the TonoVet® demonstrated species specific deviation from the manometric measurements. These differences should be considered when interpreting IOP values. Using the regression formulae presented, corrected IOP values could be calculated in a clinical setting.","",""

Setting Moorfields Eye Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom. Methods After pupil dilation, images of pseudophakic eyes with a plate-style IOL (Akreos Adapt) were obtained using a recently developed Purkinje meter. Intraocular lens decentration and tilt were evaluated by analyzing the captured images using a semiobjective method by marking the reflexes in the images and automatic calculation using a dedicated software program. In study 1, examiner 1 examined the eyes first followed by examiner 2. Ten minutes later, examiner 1 performed a second measurement, after which the intraexaminer and interexaminer reproducibility were determined. In study 2, a Purkinje meter was used to measure pseudophakic eyes with slitlamp finding of clinical IOL decentration, IOL tilt, or both. The results were compared with retroillumination photographs and slitlamp findings. Results In study 1, there was high intraexaminer reproducibility for decentration ( r = 0.95) and tilt ( r = 0.85) and high interexaminer reproducibility for decentration ( r = 0.84) and tilt ( r = 0.75). In study 2, even in extreme cases of decentration and/or tilt, the Purkinje meter measurements were possible and appeared to correlate well with slitlamp findings.

The field of MBE research was conceived based on the reasoning that modern humans spend most of their time indoors (where they come into contact with countless microor- ganisms), yet we know relatively little about the microbes and microbial ecosys- tems that exist within buildings. The microBEnet project began in 2010 and was funded as one of the keystone initiatives in the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s program in Micro- biology of the Built Environment (http://www.sloan.org/major-program- areas/basic-research/mobe/). The first phase of microBEnet represented a close, crossdisciplinary collaboration between the Eisen laboratory at the University of California (UC), Davis (microbiology and genomics research), and Hal Levin at the Building Ecology Research Group in Santa Cruz, California (building science). In the first three years of the project, microBEnet focused on four categories of activities in order to facil- itate work in the MBE field and to build a culture of openness and sharing: 1. Organizing meetings and workshops 2. Creating, curating, and sharing online resources and information 3. Enabling and educating network par- ticipants about more ‘‘open’’ activities in the field 4. Leveraging social media to encourage communication and collaboration These activities have targeted audiences in three main categories: 1. Researchers funded as part of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s MBE program 2. Other researchers working in the MBE program, or related fields, who could gain benefits or make valuable contri- butions 3. ‘‘Stakeholders’’ such as the general public and funding agencies who make decisions that should both be influ- enced by and influence our under- standing of the MBE The microBEnet project has served as a new breed of forward-looking research coordination network (akin to initiatives funded through government agencies such as the National Science Foundation). Many network activities have been exper- imental in nature, leveraging new tools and technology to foster interdisciplinary interactions (see Box 1). In terms of goals, we strived to be nimble and dynamic during the first 3 years of the project. Online networks and the study of the MBE itself were both considered ‘‘un- charted territory’’, and microBEnet was tasked with responding to community needs and suggestions. In this commen- tary, we discuss some of the lessons we have learned so far from microBEnet, with a view to facilitating the development of similar initiatives in other fields. We particularly focus on the role of open science activities in relation to community building efforts, public outreach and research-driven teaching projects, and the benefits and challenges of interdisci- plinary interactions. Being, Building, and Teaching ‘‘Openness’’ In addition to the creation of a new research field, a parallel overall goal of microBEnet is to help lead the MBE field to be a broadly open, sharing community. The importance of ‘‘openness’’ and edu- cating others on how to conduct open science, has been a central theme for much of our project. This includes both creating and curating open content and building an open social media network where anyone is welcome. Although openness is not necessary and sufficient to catalyze the creation of a new research field such as the MBE, we have chosen to emphasize this concept while building microBEnet because of the potential for Citation: Bik HM, Coil DA, Eisen JA (2014) microBEnet: Lessons Learned from Building an Interdisciplinary Scientific Community in the Online Sphere.

Objective To assess the validity and reproducibility of a quantitative FFQ with 66 food items (QFFQ) developed based on a representative sample of adolescents from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Methods 250 adolescents filled two FFQ (1-year interval) and 5 24-h recalls (3-month interval) as part of a population-based survey conducted in Sao Paulo, Brazil, in 2007. To quantify the nutrient intake, the software Nutrition Data System for Research was used. The intake was adjusted for within-person variability by the method proposed by Iowa State University, using the software PC-SIDE, and energy-adjusted for the residual method. The validity for 23 nutrients was assessed by Spearman correlation coefficient and weighted κ. Intra-class correlation coefficient and weighted κ was used to reproducibility assessment. Results In the validation, the Spearman correlation coefficients ranged from 0.25 (riboflavin) to 0.57 (phosphorus) of which eight nutrients showed acceptable correlation (>0.4). In the reproducibility analysis, the intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.18 (vitamin C) to 0.57 (niacin), of which five nutrients showed acceptable correlation. The weighted κ ranged from 0.18 (sodium) to 0.67 (riboflavin) to reproducibility and from 0.19 (polyunsatured fat) to 0.56 (calcium) to validation.

Lower-limb discrepancy following total hip arthroplasty is the third-most common reason for patient dissatisfaction in orthopaedic surgery. Therefore, accurate planning and evaluation methods are mandatory. The main aim of this study was to evaluate the reliability of the EOS™ system by establishing and comparing the reproducibility of lower-limb automatic and manual 3D measurements.

However, the effective and efficient use of biobank resources depends on their accessibility. In fact, making bio-resources promptly accessible to everybody may increase the benefits for society. Furthermore, optimizing their use and ensuring their quality will promote scientific creativity and, in general, contribute to the progress of bio-medical research. Although this has become a rather common belief, several laboratories are still secretive and continue to withhold samples and data. In this study, we conducted a questionnaire-based survey in order to investigate sample and data accessibility in research biobanks operating all over the world. The survey involved a total of 46 biobanks. Most of them gave permission to access their samples (95.7%) and data (85.4%), but free and unconditioned accessibility seemed not to be common practice. The analysis of the guidelines regarding the accessibility to resources of the biobanks that responded to the survey highlights three issues: (i) the request for applicants to explain what they would like to do with the resources requested; (ii) the role of funding, public or private, in the establishment of fruitful collaborations between biobanks and research labs; (iii) the request of co-authorship in order to give access to their data. These results suggest that economic and academic aspects are involved in determining the extent of sample and data sharing stored in biobanks. As a second step of this study, we investigated the reasons behind the high diversity of requirements to access biobank resources. The analysis of informative answers suggested that the different modalities of resource accessibility seem to be largely influenced by both social context and legislation of the countries where the biobanks operate.",WOS:000371661700002,PEERJ

He became famous for his work “Thought and Choice in Chess”, but his main contribution was methodological — De Groot co-founded the Department of Psychological Methods at the University of Amsterdam (together with R. F. van Naerssen), founded one of the leading testing and assessment companies (CITO), and wrote the monograph “Methodology” that centers on the empirical-scientific cycle: observation–induction–deduction–testing–evaluation. Here we translate one of De Groot's early articles, published in 1956 in the Dutch journal Nederlands Tijdschrift voor de Psychologie en Haar Grensgebieden . This article is more topical now than it was almost 60 years ago. De Groot stresses the difference between exploratory and confirmatory (“hypothesis testing”) research and argues that statistical inference is only sensible for the latter: “One ‘is allowed’ to apply statistical tests in exploratory research, just as long as one realizes that they do not have evidential impact”. De Groot may have also been one of the first psychologists to argue explicitly for preregistration of experiments and the associated plan of statistical analysis.

We describe these sometimes successful and sometimes not so successful experiences and analyze lessons learned that are helping us improve our services.

Concerns about such behaviours have been raised repeatedly for over half a century [9–11] but the incentive structure of academia has not changed to address them.
Despite the complex motivations that drive academia, many QRPs stem from the simple fact that the incentives which offer success to individual scientists conflict with what is best for science [12]. On the one hand are a set of gold standards that centuries of the scientific method have proven to be crucial for discovery: rigour, reproducibility, and transparency. On the other hand are a set of opposing principles born out of the academic career model: the drive to produce novel and striking results, the importance of confirming prior expectations, and the need to protect research interests from competitors. Within a culture that pressures scientists to produce rather than discover, the outcome is a biased and impoverished science in which most published results are either unconfirmed genuine discoveries or unchallenged fallacies [13]. This observation implies no moral judgement of scientists, who are as much victims of this system as they are perpetrators.","",""

This study aimed to determine the effect of chin position on the accuracy and reproducibility of NHO in a more realistic way. Materials and Methods: NHP-based digital photographs of 33 adults with normal profile were modified using the computer software Supper-Goo and Photoshop technique to produce 99 profile images in three groups with normal, forward and backward chin positions. The reconstructed images were presented to three observers who rotated the images through a circular hole on a computer monitor. The horizontal angle was read on screen and recorded whenever they found the best horizontally-oriented face. This was performed at four intervals: T0: baseline; T1: after 5 minutes; T2: after one week; and T3: one month after baseline. Results: After orientation, the mean orientation angles were 0.19° ± 1.39, 0.20° ± 1.53 and - 0.31° ± 1.38 for the normal, forward and backward chin groups, respectively. T-test did not show any significant differences in NHO and NHP among the three groups of chin position: P values of 0.17, 0.19, and 0.26 for normal, forward, and backward chin positions, respectively. However, one-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in the NHO between the normal and backward, and backward and forward chin groups. The obtained reproducibility rate of NHO calculated via Med-Calc 8.1 online software for T 0 , T 1 , T 2 and T 3 intervals was more than 60%, which is regarded significant in medical studies. Conclusion: Natural head position could be created with great reproducibility through orientation of profile im ages in different chin positions. NHO is under the influence of chin position; however, this influence is not clini cally significant.",WOS:000291363900004,MEDICINA ORAL PATOLOGIA ORAL Y CIRUGIA BUCAL

The purpose of the present study was therefore to investigate the reproducibility of 24-hour derived HRV indices in a clinical paediatric population. Eighteen children (10 boys; 12.4 ± 2.8 years) with mild to moderate Cystic Fibrosis (CF; FVC: 83 ± 12% predicted; FEV1: 80 ± 9% predicted) and eighteen age- and sex-matched controls (10 boys; 12.5 ± 2.7 years) wore a combined ECG and accelerometer for two consecutive days. Standard time and frequency domain indices of HRV were subsequently derived. Reproducibility was assessed by Bland-Altman plots, 95% limits of agreement and intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC). In both groups, there was no systematic difference between days, with the variables demonstrating a symmetrical, homoscedastic distribution around the zero line. The time domain parameters demonstrated a good to excellent reproducibility irrespective of the population considered (ICC: 0.56 to 0.86). In contrast, whilst the frequency domain parameters similarly showed excellent reproducibility in the healthy children (ICC: 0.70 to 0.96), the majority of the frequency domain parameters illustrated a poor to moderate reproducibility in those with CF (ICC: 0.22 to 0.43). The exceptions to this trend were the normalised LF and HF components which were associated with a good to excellent reproducibility. These findings thereby support the utilisation of time and relative frequency domain HRV indices as a prognostic tool in children with CF. Furthermore, the present results highlight the excellent reproducibility of HRV in healthy children, indicating that this may be a useful tool to assess intervention effectiveness in this population.",WOS:000371989200056,PLOS ONE

The purpose of this study was to investigate the precision of the second-generation HR-pQCT. The distal radius and tibia of 15 healthy men and women (age range of 20–74 yr, 8 men and 7 women) were scanned by second-generation HR-pQCT, and their geometry, bone mineral density (BMD), and the microstructure of trabecular and cortical bones were evaluated. Scans and measurements were performed by tester 1 at baseline and at 1 and 4 wk to evaluate intratester reproducibility, and by testers 2 and 3 one time each to evaluate intertester reproducibility. Reproducibility was evaluated by root mean square percent coefficient of variance (RMS%CV). Factors involved in the reproducibility of cortical porosity (Ct.Po) were also investigated. The ranges of RMS%CV were 0.2%–2.5% for geometry, 0.6%–1.7% for BMD, 0.7%–2.4% for trabecular bone, and 1.1%–1.3% for cortical thickness, showing excellent reproducibility. The range of RMS%CV for Ct.Po was 11.0%–13.3%, relatively higher than those for the other parameters. There was no apparent difference between intra- and intertester reproducibilities. There was no clear correlation between the percent coefficient of variance of Ct.Po and the subjects' background characteristics, motion artifact, and cortical bone structure. The reproducibility of the second-generation HR-pQCT was excellent in geometry, BMD, trabecular bone, and cortical thickness, with no apparent difference between intra- and intertester reproducibilities. Compared with the first-generation HR-pQCT, the reproducibility of trabecular bone was improved. The reproducibility of Ct.Po was insufficient and needed to be improved, and factors that influence its reproducibility were not clear.","",""

We present ReproPhylo, a phylogenomic analysis environment developed to ensure experimental reproducibility, to facilitate the handling of large-scale data, and to assist methodological experimentation. Reproducibility, and instantaneous repeatability, is built in to the ReproPhylo system and does not require user intervention or configuration because it stores the experimental workflow as a single, serialized Python object containing explicit provenance and environment information. This ‘single file’ approach ensures the persistence of provenance across iterations of the analysis, with changes automatically managed by the version control program Git. This file, along with a Git repository, are the primary reproducibility outputs of the program. In addition, ReproPhylo produces an extensive human-readable report and generates a comprehensive experimental archive file, both of which are suitable for submission with publications. The system facilitates thorough experimental exploration of both parameters and data. ReproPhylo is a platform independent CC0 Python module and is easily installed as a Docker image or a WinPython self-sufficient package, with a Jupyter Notebook GUI, or as a slimmer version in a Galaxy distribution.",WOS:000362266400028,PLOS COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

Reproducibility is desirable for code verification, testing, and debugging. Parallelism creates a unique problem for achieving reproducibility in Monte Carlo simulations because it changes the order in which values are summed. This is a numerical problem because double precision arithmetic is not associative. Parallel Monte Carlo, both domain replicated and decomposed simulations, will run their particles in a different order during different runs of the same simulation because the non-reproducibility of communication between processors. In addition, runs of the same simulation using different domain decompositions will also result in particles being simulated in a different order. In [1], a way of eliminating non-associative accumulations using integer tallies was described. This approach successfully achieves reproducibility at the cost of lost accuracy by rounding double precision numbers to fewer significant digits. This integer approach, and other extended and reduced precision reproducibility techniques, are described and compared in this work. Increased precision alone is not enough to ensure reproducibility of photon Monte Carlo simulations. Non-arbitrary precision approaches require a varying degree of rounding to achieve reproducibility. For the problems investigated in this work double precision global accuracy was achievable by using 100 bits of precision or greater on all unordered sums which where subsequently rounded to double precision at the end of every time-step.",WOS:000322633000011,JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL PHYSICS

Methods Ten individuals with SCI participated in the current study (C2-T10; AIS A-D; 8.6 ± 7.8 years post-injury). On two occasions, with a 10-day interval, a 10-minute resting electrocardiogram was obtained from each participant. The QTVI and QTaVI were analyzed from 256 electrocardiographic beats from all participants, and a separate analysis was performed on those with injuries above the 4th thoracic level. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) test was performed to measure day-to-day reproducibility of these measures and a Bland–Altman test was performed on all participants in order to examine the skewness of the measures. Results The reproducibility values were found to be high for both the QTVI (all participants: R  = 0.892; above T4: R  = 0.893) and the QTaVI (all participants: R  = 0.908; above T4: R  = 0.915). In addition, the reproducibility of QTVI and QTaVI did not appear to be skewed as indicated by Bland–Altman plots. Conclusion Both the QTVI and the QTaVI may be used as reproducible means of assessing cardiac autonomic function in individuals with SCI. Further, a reduction in cardiac sympathetic regulation after high thoracic and cervical level SCI does not appear to influence the day-to-day reproducibility of these measures.",WOS:000372762800003,AUTONOMIC NEUROSCIENCE-BASIC & CLINICAL

In particular, the Menpo Project provides tools for annotating images and meshes with a sparse set of fiducial markers that we refer to as landmarks. For example, Figure 1 shows an example of a face image that has been annotated with 68 2D landmarks. These landmarks are useful in a variety of areas in Computer Vision and Machine Learning including object detection, deformable modelling and tracking. The Menpo Project aims to enable researchers, practitioners and students to easily annotate new data sources and to investigate existing datasets. Of most interest to the Computer Vision is the fact that The Menpo Project contains completely open source implementations of a number of state-of-the-art algorithms for face detection and deformable model building . In the Menpo Project, we are actively developing and contributing to the state-of-the-art in deformable modelling [2], [3], [4], [5]. Characteristic examples of widely used state-of-the-art deformable model algorithms are Active Appearance Models [6],[7], Constrained Local Models [8], [9] and Supervised Descent Method [10]. However, there is still a noteworthy lack of high quality open source software in this area. Most existing packages are encrypted, compiled, non-maintained, partly documented, badly structured or difficult to modify. This makes them unsuitable for adoption in cutting edge scientific research. Consequently, research becomes even more difficult since performing a fair comparison between existing methods is, in most cases, infeasible. For this reason, we believe the Menpo Project represents an important contribution towards open science in the area of deformable modelling. We also believe it is important for deformable modelling to move beyond the established area of facial annotations and to extend to a wide variety of deformable object classes. We hope Menpo can accelerate this progress by providing all of our tools completely free and permissively licensed.","",""

Not only can the methods and the implementation be complex, but also their configuration may require setting many parameters and/or depend on particular system configurations. While many researchers recognize the importance of reproducibility, the challenge of making it happen often outweigh the benefits. Fortunately, a plethora of reproducibility solutions have been recently designed and implemented by the community. In particular, packaging tools (e.g., ReproZip) and virtualization tools (e.g., Docker) are promising solutions towards facilitating reproducibility for both authors and reviewers. To address the incentive problem, we have implemented a new publication model for the Reproducibility Section of Information Systems Journal. In this section, authors submit a reproducibility paper that explains in detail the computational assets from a previous published manuscript in Information Systems.",WOS:000378458400006,INFORMATION SYSTEMS

Methods Axial length (AL), keratometry (K) over 2.5 mm and 3.0 mm diameters, anterior chamber depth (ACD) (corneal epithelium to lens), lens thickness (LT), central corneal thickness and corneal diameter (CD) were measured with SS-OCT by two experienced operators. Intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility were assessed. AL, ACD, K and CD were also measured with PCI for agreement analysis using Bland-Altman plots.

Results Sixty-five eyes of 65 normal subjects were enrolled in the prospective study. The SS-OCT measurements revealed high repeatability and reproducibility with low test-retest repeatability, low within-subject coefficient of variation (CoV) and high intraclass correlation coefficients. Bland-Altman analysis showed narrow 95% limits of agreement for most parameters indicating excellent agreement for AL (−0.05 mm to 0.07 mm), K values both at 2.5 mm (−0.42 D to 0.20 D) and 3.0 mm (−0.42 D to 0.08 D) and ACD (−0.19 mm to 0.22 mm) except for the CD (−1.11 mm to −0.01 mm).

Conclusions The repeatability and reproducibility of SS-OCT were excellent for all parameters including AL, K, ACD, LT and CD values. High agreement was shown between SS-OCT and PCI for most biometrical parameters.",WOS:000397410300023,BRITISH JOURNAL OF OPHTHALMOLOGY

Secondary aims were to investigate whether maternal BMI and acquisition modality (transabdominal or transvaginal) affect feasibility and reliability of UtA Doppler evaluation. Methods Singleton pregnancies between 11(+0) and 13(+6) weeks underwent TA and TV Doppler measurements of UtA prospectively, blindly and independently by Fetal Medicine Foundation-accredited operators. The more experienced operator performed all the scans to assess intra-observer reproducibility. Inter-observer reproducibility and generalizability was evaluated among different operators and different ultrasound equipment. Intra-and inter-rater reliability was assessed by Concordance Correlation Coefficient and Intraclass Correlation Coefficient; agreement was estimated with Limits of Agreement and reported graphically with Bland-Altman plots. Correlation between BMI and feasibility and accuracy of UtA measurements were studied with Spearman's correlation coefficient. Differences between TA and TV measurements were evaluated by Wilcoxon test. Results A total of 101 women were enrolled. The intra-observer reproducibility for TA and TV measurements ranged from 0.87 to 0.94, respectively. The inter-observer reproducibility varied from 0.57 (for TA measurements by the less experienced operator) to 0.95 (for TV measurements by the more experienced operator), and it was independent of the ultrasound equipment used. Spearman's correlation coefficient failed to demonstrate a correlation between BMI and time to get the first set of TA-TV measurements, or between BMI and TA-TV reproducibility. In four patients, the operators could not obtain the TA measurements due to high BMI. In our population the UtA pulsatility index (PI) values did not differ significantly between the TA or TV approach. Conclusions UtA PI measurements obtained by experienced operators show a moderate intra-and inter-observer reproducibility. The TV approach might be used when TA measurements fail in obese women, especially since specific reference ranges for TV measurements may not be necessary.

Design  Systematic review and narrative synthesis of reproducibility studies. Data sources  Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO searched up to 16 March 2016, without language restrictions, and review of bibliographies of included studies. Eligibility criteria  Observational studies investigating reproducibility among healthcare professionals performing disability evaluations using a global rating of working capacity and reporting inter-rater reliability by a statistical measure or descriptively. Studies could be conducted in insurance settings, where decisions on ability to work include normative judgments based on legal considerations, or in research settings, where decisions on ability to work disregard normative considerations. Teams of paired reviewers identified eligible studies, appraised their methodological quality and generalisability, and abstracted results with pretested forms. As heterogeneity of research designs and findings impeded a quantitative analysis, a descriptive synthesis stratified by setting (insurance or research) was performed. Results  From 4562 references, 101 full text articles were reviewed. Of these, 16 studies conducted in an insurance setting and seven in a research setting, performed in 12 countries, met the inclusion criteria. Studies in the insurance setting were conducted with medical experts assessing claimants who were actual disability claimants or played by actors, hypothetical cases, or short written scenarios. Conditions were mental (n=6, 38%), musculoskeletal (n=4, 25%), or mixed (n=6, 38%). Applicability of findings from studies conducted in an insurance setting to real life evaluations ranged from generalisable (n=7, 44%) and probably generalisable (n=3, 19%) to probably not generalisable (n=6, 37%). Median inter-rater reliability among experts was 0.45 (range intraclass correlation coefficient 0.86 to κ−0.10). Inter-rater reliability was poor in six studies (37%) and excellent in only two (13%). This contrasts with studies conducted in the research setting, where the median inter-rater reliability was 0.76 (range 0.91-0.53), and 71% (5/7) studies achieved excellent inter-rater reliability. Reliability between assessing professionals was higher when the evaluation was guided by a standardised instrument (23 studies, P=0.006). No such association was detected for subjective or chronic health conditions or the studies’ generalisability to real world evaluation of disability (P=0.46, 0.45, and 0.65, respectively). Conclusions  Despite their common use and far reaching consequences for workers claiming disabling injury or illness, research on the reliability of medical evaluations of disability for work is limited and indicates high variation in judgments among assessing professionals. Standardising the evaluation process could improve reliability. Development and testing of instruments and structured approaches to improve reliability in evaluation of disability are urgently needed.",WOS:000393177700005,BMJ-BRITISH MEDICAL JOURNAL

Setting Department of Ophthalmology, Turgut Ozal University, Medical School, Ankara, Turkey. Design Evaluation of diagnostic technology. Methods To assess the repeatability and reproducibility of the optical biometer, 2 independent examiners performed 3 consecutive measurements. The following parameters were evaluated: central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth, axial length (AL), corneal dioptric power in the flattest meridian (flat keratometry [K]) and in the steepest meridian (steep K), and white-to-white (WTW) distance. Repeatability was assessed using the within-subject standard deviation (S w ), repeatability, and precision. Reproducibility was evaluated using the 95% limits of agreement proposed by Bland and Altman. Results Thirty healthy subjects and 27 patients with keratoconus were evaluated. Both examiners achieved high repeatability for all parameters in each group except for the steep K measurement in keratoconic eyes performed by examiner 2 (S w  = 3.341). The WTW in normal eyes and the CCT and steep K in keratoconic eyes showed less repeatability. In both groups, the smallest range of agreement was in AL measurements whereas the largest was in CCT measurements. In keratoconic eyes, the range of agreement for steep K was also greater (3.766).

The assessment of a measurement system is known as “Gage Repeatability and Reproducibility” (GR&R). “Measurement System Analysis” (MSA) should be performed at the beginning of an experimental study to ensure that the information to be collected are true representation of what is occurring in the experiment. Experimental data collected under the same condition usually show variation, which arises partly from the experimental system, partly from the measurement devices and partly from the operator who makes the measurements. MSA helps to differentiate the contribution of each source to the randomness of the data. In this way, one may see whether there is a need to reduce the measurement variation so that the data reflects basically the experimental variation. Besides, MSA gives quantitative measures for repeatability and reproducibility. Repeatability is the variation in repeated measurements taken by the same operator under the same experimental conditions. Reproducibility is the variation in data obtained by different operators taking the measurement with the same setup under the same conditions. These are measures of the consistency and precision of the data. GR&R is the most common MSA tool that analyzes the viability of an experimental set-up. Resultant GR&R will indicate overall measurement system variation as the sum of repeatability variation and reproducibility variation. Generally, GR&R % gives a measure of the suitability of the measurement system to yield acceptable data for statistical studies such as “Design Of Experiments” (DOE), “One Factor At a Time” (OFAT), “Response Surface Methodology”, etc. [1, 2]. In this paper, “Analysis of Variance” (ANOVA) and the “Average and Range” (Xbar & R) methods are used to assess the capability of a laboratory made measurement device, which is used for the investigations of a belt drive system efficiency. GR&R is applied at the design stages of the construction of the test rig and final application is presented in this study. The results prove that the test rig is capable of making experimental studies using statistical methods such as DOE and Response Surface Methodology.Copyright © 2011 by ASME","",""

The goal of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of quantitative magnetization-transfer imaging parameter estimates in healthy subjects. Magnetization-transfer–weighted and T1 relaxometry data were acquired in five healthy subjects at multiple time points, and the variability of the resulting fitted magnetization-transfer parameters was evaluated. The impact of subsampling the magnetization-transfer data and correcting field inhomogeneities was also evaluated. The key parameters measured in this study had an average variability, across time points, of 4.7% for the relative size of the restricted pool (F), 7.3% for the forward exchange constant (kf), 1.9% for the free pool spin-lattice relaxation constant (R1f), 4.5% for the T2 of the free pool (T2f), and 2.3% for the T2 of the restricted pool (T2r). Our findings show that serial quantitative magnetization-transfer imaging experiments can be performed reliably, with good reproducibility of the model parameter estimates, and demonstrate the reproducibility of acquisition schemes with fewer magnetization-transfer contrasts. This establishes the feasibility of this technique for monitoring patients affected by degenerative white matter diseases while providing critical data to estimate the statistical power of such studies.

Universities developed novel breeding techniques, and small grow out mom-and-pop farms implemented them. Eyed eggs were generic and standardized products, and traded at the lowest possible cost. As an eyed egg, the fry and in particular the eyes are visible through the membrane. The interplay between the regimes of open science and proprietary science has changed significantly in salmon aquaculture over the last two decades. One aspect of this change is that husbandry breeding has become more industrialized and subsequently more controlled by large, specialized and capital intensive breeding corporations. This paper explores this development from the perspectives of process-oriented institutional theory. We identify critical junctures in the coevolution of the breeding and grow-out sectors, and analyze how these junctures structure and change the direction of industrial and economic development. Ultimately, the generic, standardized and undervalued eyed eggs were subject to revaluation by the novel dominant international actors in the Atlantic salmon industry. We primarily draw data from interviews with core actors and informants at relevant universities, breeding companies and governmental agencies, as well as from white papers and other secondary material.",WOS:000354489000008,AQUACULTURE

Recent examples demonstrate that pivotal scientific findings cannot be replicated, due to poor documentation or methodological bias, sparking debate across scientific and regulatory communities. However, there is general agreement that improvements in communicating and documenting research and risk assessment methods are needed. In the case of formaldehyde, the peer-review conducted by a National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Committee questioned the approaches used by the Integrated Risk Information System (IRIS) in developing draft unit risk values. Using the original data from the key study (Beane Freeman et al., 2009) and documentation provided in the draft IRIS profile, we attempted to duplicate the reported inhalation unit risk values and address the NAS Committee's questions regarding application of the appropriate dose-response model. Overall, documentation of the methods lacked sufficient detail to allow for replication of the unit risk estimates, specifically for Hodgkin lymphoma and leukemias, the key systemic endpoints selected by IRIS. The lack of apparent exposure-response relationships for selected endpoints raises the question whether quantitative analyses are appropriate for these endpoints, and if so, how results are to be interpreted.",WOS:000389865600055,REGULATORY TOXICOLOGY AND PHARMACOLOGY

To actively promote the stewardship of all the research data that are produced at Leiden University, a comprehensive, institution-wide programme was launched in 2015, which centrally aims to encourage its researchers to carefully plan the temporal storage, long-term preservation and potential reuse of their data. This programme, which is managed centrally by the Department of Academic Affairs, and which receives important contributions from academic staff, from Leiden University Libraries, and from the University’s central ICT organisation, basically consists of three parts. Firstly, a basic central policy has been formulated, containing clear guidelines for activities before, during and after research projects. The central aim of this institutional policy is to ensure that all Leiden-based research projects can effectively comply with the most common requirements stipulated by funding agencies, academic publishers, the Dutch standard evaluation protocol and the European data protection directive. As a second part of the data management programme, faculties have organised workshops and meetings, concentrating on the rationale and on the technical and organisational practicalities of effective data management in order to bring about a discipline-specific protocol. Data librarians employed by Leiden University Libraries have developed educational materials and provide training for PhDs in the principles and benefits of good data management. Thirdly, to ensure that scholars can genuinely make a reasoned selection among the many tools that are currently available, a central catalogue was developed which lists and characterises the most relevant data management services. The catalogue currently provides information about, amongst many other aspects, the organisations behind these services, the main academic disciplines which are targeted and the accepted file formats and metadata formats. The various aspects of these facilities have been classified using terminology provided by conceptual models developed by the UKDA, ANDS and the DCC. Using Leiden University’s policy guidelines as criteria, the overall suitability of each service has also been evaluated. Leiden University’s data management programme has a total duration of three years, and its basic objective is to offer a comprehensive form of support, in which the data management policy which is propagated centrally is complemented by various forms of assistance which ought to make it easier for scholars to adhere to this policy. The catalogue of data management services also aims to bolster the implementation of an adequate technical infrastructure, as the qualitative evaluations of the services enable policy-makers and developers to quickly establish gaps or other shortcomings within existing facilities.","",""

Publishing research results as a preprint is also used to disseminate findings as rapid and as fast as possible. Post publication peer-review is also added to the reviewing system to add openness, transparency, and objectivity. It offers credit to the reviewers. We also see the growth of impact indicators as the results of San Francisco Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) statutory.

However, many round robin tests reveal that the measurements on material properties – especially hygric properties – have poor reproducibility. Thus the measurement and data analysis methods should be questioned, and the currently available databases for material properties are not perfectly reliable. In this paper we aim at analyzing the material errors, repeatability errors, between-lab errors and reproducibility errors involved in the determination of hygric properties of porous building materials. The same materials as those used in the EC HAMSTAD project – autoclaved aerated concrete, calcium silicate board and ceramic brick – are chosen as target materials in our tests to facilitate error analysis. Static gravimetric tests, cup tests, capillary absorption tests, vacuum saturation tests and pressure plate tests have been repeated three times under repeatability conditions. Then the experimental results are analyzed in combination with the EC HAMSTAD report to calculate various errors. Results show that different materials have different heterogeneity errors, which can hardly be avoided. Moreover, in general these tests have excellent repeatability, indicating that under proper control the tests themselves are trustworthy. However, the large between-lab errors and the subsequent poor reproducibility demonstrate that in different labs the experimental procedures, condition controls, as well as data processing methods can deviate significantly. As a result, stricter and more detailed instructions are needed to improve the reproducibility of the tests for determining the hygric properties of porous building materials.",WOS:000350184900017,BUILDING AND ENVIRONMENT

One approach for determining a qualitative method’s reproducibility is presented for microbiological methods, where the distribution of colony forming units (CFU) follows a Poisson distribution. The method’s reproducibility is defined in terms of the variability of the limit of detection (LOD) values. For a better estimation of reproducibility precision, our proposed approach is using an orthogonal factorial plan.

Throughout a project’s lifecycle curators organize newly generated data while cleaning and integrating legacy data when it exists, and deciding what data will be preserved for the long term. Although these actions should be part of a well-oiled data management workflow, there are practical challenges in doing so if the collection is very large and heterogeneous, or is accessed by several researchers contemporaneously. There is a need for data management solutions that can help curators with efficient and on-demand analyses of their collection so that they remain well-informed about its evolving characteristics. In this paper, we describe our efforts towards developing a workflow to leverage open science High Performance Computing (HPC) resources for routinely and efficiently conducting data management tasks on large collections. We demonstrate that HPC resources and techniques can significantly reduce the time for accomplishing critical data management tasks, and enable a dynamic archiving throughout the research process. We use a large archaeological data collection with a long and complex formation history as our test case.

The aim of this study was the evaluation of the fit of the scanbodies and their ability of reposition. At the site of the first molars and canines, implants were placed bilaterally in a polymer lower arch model (original model), and an impression was taken for fabricating a stone cast (stone model). Ten white-light scans were obtained from the original and the stone model with the scanbodies in place. The scanbodies were retrieved after each scan and re-attached to the same implant or lab analogue. The first scan of the series served as control in both groups. The subsequent nine scans and control were superimposed using inspection software to identify the discrepancies of the four scanbodies in both experimental groups. The systematic error of digitizing the models was 13 μm for the polymer and 5 μm for the stone model. The mean discrepancy of the scanbodies was 39 μm (±58 μm) on the original implants versus 11 μm (±17 μm) on the lab analogues. The difference in scanbody discrepancy between original implants and lab analogues was statistically significant (p < 0.05, Mann–Whitney U test). Scanbody discrepancy was higher on original implants than on lab analogues.

However, relatively few resources have been made accessible to the potentially large group of Earth science and engineering users. New users have to invest an extraordinary effort to study the models. To provide a stimulating experience focusing on the learning curve of integrated modeling of coupled surface-subsurface flow, we describe use cases of an open source model, the Penn State Integrated Hydrologic Model, PIHM. New users were guided through data processing and model application by reproducing a numerical benchmark problem and a real-world watershed simulation. Specifically, we document the PIHM application and its computational workflow to enable intuitive understanding of coupled surface-subsurface flow processes. In addition, we describe the user experience as important evidence of the significance of reusability. The interaction shows that documentation of data, software, and computational workflow in research papers is a promising method to foster open scientific collaboration and reuse.

However, traceability and reproducibility of results are indispensable elements of high-quality science, and an increasing requirement of many journals and funding sources. Reproducible studies include code able to regenerate results from the original data. This practice not only provides a perfect record of the whole analysis but also reduces the probability of errors and facilitates code reuse, thus accelerating scientific progress. But doing reproducible science also brings many benefits to the individual researcher, including saving time and effort, improved collaborations, and higher quality and impact of final publications.

Study design Inter-observer reproducibility study. Fifty women underwent successful bilateral placement of microinserts (Essure ® ) by hysteroscopy in the Department of Gynaecology of a teaching hospital and were included in the study. At three month, 3D ultrasound coronal views of the fifty uterus (accounting for one hundred microinserts) were assessed by five different observers and microinsert position was classified according to the classification described by Legendre et al. Inter-observer reproducibility in reading the 3D coronal view of the uterus was evaluated. Results The k -value was disparate, from 0.26 to 0.82. Inter-observer reproducibility then ranged from fair to almost perfect, depending on a prior knowledge of the position classification. Conclusions Transvaginal 3D coronal view of the uterus is sufficient to assess the positioning of the microinserts when the practionner or the surgeon is familiar with the classification method.","",""

By the order effect we mean a dependence of probability distributions (of measurement results) on the order of measurements. We consider two types of the sequential reproducibility: adjacent reproducibility (\\(A-A\\)) (the standard perfect repeatability) and separated reproducibility(\\(A-B-A\\)). The first one is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of measurement of some observable A measured twice, one A measurement after the other. The second one, \\(A-B-A\\), is reproducibility with probability 1 of a result of A measurement when another quantum observable B is measured between two A’s. Heuristically, it is clear that the second type of reproducibility is complementary to the order effect. We show that, surprisingly, this may not be the case. The order effect can coexist with a separated reproducibility as well as adjacent reproducibility for both observables A and B. However, the additional constraint in the form of separated reproducibility of the \\(B-A-B\\) type makes this coexistence impossible.

Those two parameters should be used for the characterization of muscular adaptations in athletes. Methods The isokinetic performance of the knee extensors and flexors in both limbs was measured in 29 male athletes. The experimental protocol consisted of three consecutive identical paradigms separated by 45 min breaks. Each test consisted of four maximal concentric efforts performed at 60 and 180°/s. Reproducibility was quantified by the standard error measurement (SEM), the coefficient of variation (CV) and by means of intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) with the calculation of 6 forms of ICCs. Results Using ICC as the indicator of reproducibility, the correlations for TPT of both limbs showed a range of 0.51–0.65 in extension and 0.50–0.63 in flexion. For APT, the values were 0.46–0.60 and 0.51–0.81, respectively. In addition, the calculated standard error of measurement (SEM) and CV scores confirmed the low level of absolute reproducibility. Conclusions Due to their low reproducibility, neither TPT nor APT can serve as independent isokinetic parameters of knee flexor and extensor performance. So, given its reproducibility level, TPT and APT should not be used for the characterization of muscular adaptations in athletes.","",""

Methods SICI was measured in 12 healthy volunteers (31  ±  7.6 years) from the right FDI muscle using an automated stimulation protocol incorporating (i) conventional, fixed-intensity (A-SICI) and (ii) threshold tracking (T-SICI) methods at conditioning stimuli (CS) of 50–80% resting motor threshold (RMT) and interstimulus interval of 2.5 ms. Measurements were repeated on the same day and at least a week later by a single operator. Results No significant differences in RMT, A-SICI and T-SICI were observed between sessions. At 50% RMT CS both types of SICI had poor reproducibility. At all other CS intensities, T-SICI had excellent intraday (intraclass correlation coefficient, ICC 0.81–0.92) and adequate-to-excellent interday (ICC 0.61–0.88) reproducibility, while A-SICI showed poor intraday and poor-to-adequate interday reproducibility (ICC 0.29–0.37 and 0.37–0.51, respectively). Conclusion SICI measured by threshold tracking shows good intra- and interday reproducibility.

(1) To describe a protocol for measurement of the anatomic lateral distal femoral angle (aLDFA), angle of anteversion (AA), mechanical medial proximal tibial angle (mMPTA), tibial tuberosity displacement (TTD), and crural torsion angle (CTA) from computed tomography (CT) multiplanar reconstructions of canine hindlimbs. (2) To test the intra-observer variability (repeatability) and inter-observer variability (reproducibility) of the protocol. (3) To assess the proportion of variance in the measurement of each parameter explained by dog, observer, body mass, and medial patellar luxation (MPL).



Study design

Anatomic study.



Animals

Twenty client-owned dogs.



Methods

A protocol for the measurement of aLDFA, AA, mMPTA, TTD, and CTA was performed by 3 observers, and performed 3 times by 1 observer, on CT multiplanar reconstructions of 20 canine hindlimbs. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) were calculated for each parameter to examine intra-observer variability (repeatability) and inter-observer variability (reproducibility). The proportion of variance in the measurement of each parameter explained by dog, observer, body mass, and MPL was assessed using mixed effect, linear models.



Results

Intra-observer and inter-observer ICC were >0.8 for all parameters indicating good repeatability and reproducibility. Most of the variance in the measurement of each parameter was attributable to dog.



Conclusions

The CT protocol, as described, was repeatable and reproducible for assessing the femoral and tibial alignment of dogs.",WOS:000346963000015,VETERINARY SURGERY

First, all submissions to the journal are now screened by plagiarism detection software (iThenticate: www.ithenticate.com/). Second, we now explicitly offer our reviewers the option to sign their reviews so that their name is disclosed to the study authors in the decision letter. Here I describe the rationale behind these two innovations, and I welcome feedback from our readers, authors, and reviewers.

The pressure to publish can lead to a number of unfortunate consequences, including the temptation to take shortcuts when preparing manuscripts. Plagiarism is certainly not a new problem, but it may have become more prevalent as electronic databases of articles and other resources have proliferated. Since introducing the routine use of plagiarism detection software, we have detected a small number of potentially problematic cases. It is important to note that these are all then carefully read by a member of the editorial team before a decision as to how to proceed is made. The cases we have identified typically involve either authors using sections from their own publications again (particularly descriptions of methodological procedures), or only minimally reworking passages from other publications that are not their own. The first case is often understandable, in that it may be inefficient to completely rewrite the details of a procedure that is routinely used across many studies (and there are presumably only a finite number of ways to do so). We tend to take a pragmatic view in these cases, whilst also asking our authors to minimize direct overlap as much as possible. The second case is more problematic, and here we will return the manuscript to the authors and ask them to express the relevant sections in their own words. There is potentially a third case, where authors attempt to pass off entire publications by other authors as their own. This is a much more serious situation, but fortunately we have not yet encountered this since adopting the routine use of the plagiarism detection software, and my hope is that by making it known that we are using this software the likelihood of this happening will be low.

The introduction of the routine use of plagiarism detection software is motivated by a desire to prevent problematic behavior. The introduction of an explicit option for our reviewers to sign their review, on the other hand, is motivated by a despite to promote positive behavior. There is evidence that open peer review leads to higher quality reviews,1 and it is consistent with the growing interest in many quarters in open science (including open access, open data, and so on). Nevertheless, I am also conscious that some may not feel comfortable revealing their identity (eg, if an early career researcher has critical comments on the work of a more senior researcher). It is entirely at the discretion of our reviewers whether to sign their reviews, although I would encourage them to consider it. In my experience, it encourages more thoughtful, measured comments. It will be interesting to see what the uptake of this option is among our reviewers, but we are already beginning to see the option being used.

I feel that these are important innovations. The first removes the onus from our editors and reviewers to detect possible cases of plagiarism, and makes it more likely that problematic manuscripts will be identified. The second offers our reviewers the explicit option to reveal their names, without requiring this. My hope is that our use of plagiarism detection software will become increasingly irrelevant, and that the option to sign reviews will lead to greater openness in our review process, and further improves the quality of the already-excellent reviews we receive.",WOS:000363174000001,NICOTINE & TOBACCO RESEARCH

Several factors possibly contribute to a lack of reproducibility, including a failure to adequately employ statistical considerations during study design, bias in sample selection or subject recruitment, errors in developing data inclusion/exclusion criteria, and flawed statistical analysis. To address some of these issues, several publishers have developed checklists that authors must complete. Others have either enhanced statistical expertise on existing editorial boards, or formed distinct statistics editorial boards. Although the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Office of Research and Development, already has a strong Quality Assurance Program, an initiative was undertaken to further strengthen statistics consideration and other factors in study design and also to ensure these same factors are evaluated during the review and approval of study protocols. To raise awareness of the importance of statistical issues and provide a forum for robust discussion, a Community of Practice for Statistics was formed in January 2014. In addition, three working groups were established to develop a series of questions or criteria that should be considered when designing or reviewing experimental, observational, or modeling focused research. This article describes the process used to develop these study design guidance documents, their contents, how they are being employed by the Agency’s research enterprise, and expected benefits to Agency science.

The aim of this study was to ascertain the role of a dedicated training program to improve skills and the reproducibility of dyssynchrony assessment. Methods In 70 patients with heart failure, color Doppler tissue images were acquired, and the time to peak systolic velocity of each segment and several dyssynchrony indices, including the standard deviation of time to peak systolic velocity, were measured by an expert to constitute a reference standard. The same images were then assessed by two beginners, who had only basic knowledge of dyssynchrony analysis after a 1-hour lecture, and two graduates, who had received a structured hands-on training program. Both sets of results were compared with the standard. Results For the standard deviation of time to peak systolic velocity, the linear correlations between the standard and beginner 1 ( r  = 0.643) and beginner 2 ( r  = 0.532) were only modest ( P P Conclusions There is a learning curve for the measurement of systolic dyssynchrony using Doppler tissue imaging, but good reproducibility can be achieved by the use of a dedicated training program.",WOS:000299532800011,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY

Scientific computing has influenced how science is done today, achieving breakthroughs that were impossible to achieve several decades ago. For the past decade several such communities in the Open Science Grid (OSG) and the European Grid Infrastructure (EGI) have been using GlideinWMS to run complex application workflows to effectively share computational resources over the grid. GlideinWMS is a pilot-based workload management system (WMS) that creates on demand, a dynamically sized overlay HTCondor batch system on grid resources. At present, the computational resources shared over the grid are just adequate to sustain the computing needs. We envision that the complexity of the science driven by 'Big Data' will further push the need for computational resources. To fulfill their increasing demands and/or to run specialized workflows, some of the big communities like CMS are investigating the use of cloud computing as Infrastructure-As-A-Service (IAAS) with GlideinWMS as a potential alternative to fill the void. Similarly, communities with no previous access to computing resources can use GlideinWMS to setup up a batch system on the cloud infrastructure. To enable this, the architecture of GlideinWMS has been extended tomore » enable support for interfacing GlideinWMS with different Scientific and commercial cloud providers like HLT, FutureGrid, FermiCloud and Amazon EC2. In this paper, we describe a solution for cloud bursting with GlideinWMS.

Such a number is surprising, given the theoretical reproducibility of computational research and given Bourne was attempting to reproduce work done in his own lab. Now at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as Associate Director of Data Sciences, Bourne is concerned with the reproducibility of all NIH funded work, not just his own—and the problem is large. In addition to work in computational biology (which theoretically should be more easily reproducible than “wet lab” work), hallmark papers in cancer through to psychology have been flagged as largely unreproducible [2, 3]. Closer to home, GigaScience has carried out similar work to quantify reproducibility in their content. Despite being scrutinized and tested by seven referees, it still took about half a man-month worth of resources to reproduce the results reported in just one of the tables [4]. “Reproducibility” is now increasingly on the radar of funders and is making its rounds in the wider media as well, with concerns of reproducibility making headlines at The Economist [5] and New York Times [6], amongst other outlets.",WOS:000358345600001,GENOME BIOLOGY

This article summarizes some of these arguments and results that led to discussions about a “replication crisis” in research. In criminology, there is not yet a similar discussion, although the need for more replications has been emphasized in the past. The present article addresses this topic with special consideration of program evaluations in early developmental crime prevention and offender treatment. In both fields, there has been substantial progress in research and practice. Most systematic reviews showed mean positive effects; however, nearly all of them demonstrated very heterogeneous findings that could not be attributed to the content of programs. This does not allow simple recommendations of “what works” for policy-making and practice. In addition, there is a serious lack of long-term follow-ups and independent evaluations. The article shows remarkable similarity of the findings and problems in both fields of intervention. Problems of reproducibility prove to be highly relevant for criminology, although there is no need for using the term “crisis”. The article proposes various strategies that can enhance the reproducibility of findings, i.e., more systematic investigation of those differentiated conditions under which interventions are most effective. An integrative model of relevant characteristics is briefly presented. It refers to factors of the programs, contexts, participants, and evaluation methods. Confirmatory meta-analyses can play an important role on the path toward more differentiated and replicated knowledge","",""

Up to three points are assigned for each of the following criteria: Tumor size (R), exophytic vs endophytic nature (E), nearness to the collecting system (N), anterior vs posterior (A), and polar location (L), with more complex lesions receiving higher scores. There are no independent studies to date that validate the reproducibility of this scoring system. Our aim was to validate the R.E.N.A.L. NS system by assessing interobserver variability, and therefore reproducibility and fidelity of this proposed assessment tool. Patients and Methods: We reviewed our prospectively collected laparoscopic partial nephrectomy (LPN) database and identified 306 patients with available preoperative CT or MRI.

Methods: Percent depth doses (PDDs) and profiles were collected on two SNC 3DS tanks with a Varian TrueBeam linear accelerator. SNC Dosimetry auto-setup application was used with CC13 ionization chambers. After auto-setup, collimator light field was checked manually against the position of the chamber. Comparing measured data for repeated measurements with tank 1 allowed evaluation of SNC-3DS auto-setup and tank reproducibility. Comparing measured data between tanks 1 and 2 allowed evaluation of consistency between tanks. Results: Preliminary results showed reproducibility of depth of maximum dose (Dmax) of 0.38mm for a 10cmx10cm field and 0.67mm for 30cmx30cm on a single tank. PDD values at 5cm, 10cm, and 20cm depths were reproducible within 0.26%. Consistency of Dmax between tanks was 0.17mm for a 10cmx10cm field and 0.44mm for 30cmx30cm. PDD values at 5cm, 10cm, and 20cmwere consistent within 0.06%. Profiles showed reproducibility in field width within 0.4mm for a 10cmx10cm field and 0.7mm for a 30cmx30cm field. Profiles showed consistency in field width within 0.2mm for 10cmx10cm and 30cmx30cm field sizes. Penumbra width was reproducible and consistent to under 0.5mm except for 30cmx30cm field size at 30cm depth where the reproducibility was 2.2mm and the consistency was 2.6mm. Conclusion: In conclusion, the SNC 3DS tank shows good reproducibility in measured data. Since the tank to tank variation in measured data is within the uncertainty of repeated single tank measurements the tanks also perform consistently.","",""

To determine the precision of the ruler, the caliper, and a recently developed 2-dimensional (2D) vision-based measuring device under field conditions, for respectively teat length, teat diameter, and both teat length and diameter, 2 experiments were conducted in which the consistency of measurements within operators (repeatability) and between operators (reproducibility) was tested. In addition, the agreement of the 2D device with the ruler and the caliper was studied. Although the ruler and the 2D device poorly agreed, both methods were precise in measuring teat length when the operators had experience in working with cows. The caliper was repeatable in measuring teat diameter, but was not reproducible. The 2D device was also repeatable in measuring teat diameter, and reproducible when the operators had experience with the device. The methods had poor agreement, most likely due to the operator-dependent pressure applied by the caliper. Because the 2D device has the advantage of measuring both teat length and teat diameters in a single measurement and is accurate and practical, this method allows efficient and fast collection of data on a large scale for various applications.",WOS:000312524300040,JOURNAL OF DAIRY SCIENCE

Nevertheless, the implementation of GR&R requires considerable time and manpower, and is likely to affect production adversely. In addition, the evaluation value for GR&R is always different owing to the sum of man-made and machine-made variations.

The suitability of any data should be considered on a case-by-case basis, and data indicates that the coefficients included in the \"Angry Birds\" meta-analysis did not distort results. Study selection, effect size extraction, and interpretation improved upon problematic issues in other recent meta-analyses. Further evidence is also provided to support the contention that publication bias remains problematic in video game literature.

To assess the reproducibility and validity of the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) asthma written questionnaire (IAWQ) for 6- to 7-year-old children administered to their parents/caregivers through a telephone interview. Methods. Our study included 100 children selected from three health units in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. In total, 50 asthmatic and 50 non-asthmatic children were evaluated; all participants were required to own a household telephone line. Initially, telephone interviews were conducted with the parents/caregivers using the IAWQ. After 2 weeks, parents/caregivers were invited to complete the IAWQ under supervision provided by the researchers. After fifteen days, the telephone interviews were repeated. The reproducibility between the two telephone interviews was assessed using kappa (κ) coefficients; the construct validity was assessed by comparing the answers obtained in the initial telephone interview in both groups according to the clinical diagnosi...",WOS:000305537800009,JOURNAL OF ASTHMA

In addition, its design does not entail the movement of resistance against Earth's gravitational pull. Thus, the design and operation associated with the IKE may be incorporated into novel environments such as space flight. Yet before it can be used for such reasons, IKE data reproducibility must first be ascertained, which serves as the present study's purpose. Methods to assess data reproducibility required subjects (n = 42) to perform 2 IKE elbow flexor trials, each comprising two 60-second sets separated by a 90-second rest. Preceded by a familiarization session on the IKE, subjects were instructed to perform high-speed elbow flexor trial repetitions in good form. Instrumentation entailed an accelerometer and a computer interfaced with software. Maximum and average forces (MF, AF), as well as work (W), were examined for reproducibility with several test-retest measures. Results showed high reproducibility, yet intertrial variability was greater due in part to the length of time between exercise sessions. It was concluded that MF reproducibility was inherently less partly due to the nature of the variable, which entailed a single instantaneous expression over each 60-second set. In contrast, AF and W denoted a cumulative, and thus better overall, representation of total exercise performance. Based on our high reproducibility values, present IKE instrumentation methods appear to be appropriate. Practical applications suggest that coaches and therapists may want to employ an IKE as instrumented in the present study to derive reproducible performance data on people who may use the device under their supervision.","",""

After several failed attempts at email-parser based ticket exchanges, the OSG Operations Group has designed a comprehensive ticket synchronizing application. The GOC-TX application uses web-service interfaces offered by various commercial, open source and other homegrown ticketing systems, to synchronize tickets between two or more of these systems. GOC-TX operates independently from any ticketing system. It can be triggered by one ticketing system via email, active messaging, or a web-services call to check for current sync-status, pull applicable recent updates since prior synchronizations to the source ticket, and apply the updates to a destination ticket. The currently deployed production version of GOC-TX is able to synchronize tickets between the Numara Footprints ticketing system used by the OSG and the following systems: European Grid Initiative's system Global Grid User Support (GGUS) and the Request Tracker (RT) system used by Brookhaven. Additional interfaces to the BMC Remedy system used by Fermilab, and to other instances of RT used by other OSG partners, are expected to be completed in summer 2010. A fully configurable open source version is expected to be made available by early autumn 2010.

Data on the inter-examiner reproducibility of the suggested clinical tests and criteria and their mutual dependencies for identifying subacromial impingement symptoms (SIS) are not available.

Objective To test the inter-examiner reproducibility of selected tests and criteria suggested for classifying SIS and the mutual dependencies of each of the individual tests and SIS.

Method A standardised three-phase protocol for clinical reproducibility studies was followed, consisting of a training, an overall agreement and a study phase. To proceed to the study phase, an overall agreement of 0.80 was required. In total 10, 20 and 44 subjects were included in the three phases, respectively. The case prevalence in the study phase was 50%. The inclusion criterion for cases was ≥3, and for controls ≤1 positive test out of four. Cohen's κ statistics were used for calculating agreement.

Results In the overall agreement phase, an agreement of 0.90 was obtained, while in the study phase it was 0.98 with a κ of 0.95 for SIS. κ Values for the individual tests varied between 0.60 and 0.95. Mutual dependencies between each test and SIS showed Neer's test with anterior pain to be most often used to determine SIS.

Conclusions Inter-examiner reproducibility was moderate to almost perfect for the selected tests and criteria for SIS. The next challenge will be to establish reproducibility in clinical practice, as well as the validity of the tests and criteria for SIS.",WOS:000208638000018,BMJ OPEN

When done thoughtfully, this approach to citizen science can transform humans and their environment. Despite such possibilities, many projects struggle to meet decision-maker needs, generate useful data to inform decisions, and improve social-ecological resilience. Here, we define leveraging the ‘power of place’ in citizen science, and posit that doing this improves conservation decision making, increases participation, and improves community resilience. First, we explore ‘place’ and identify five place dimensions: social-ecological, narrative and name-based, knowledge-based, emotional and affective, and performative. We then thematically analyze 134 case studies drawn from CitSci.org ( n  = 39), The Stewardship Network New England (TSN-NE; n  = 39), and Earthwatch ( n  = 56) regarding: (1) use of place dimensions in materials (as one indication of leveraging the power of place), (2) intent for use of data in decision-making, and (3) evidence of such use. We find that 89% of projects intend for data to be used, 46% demonstrate no evidence of use, and 54% provide some evidence of use. Moreover, projects used in decision making leverage more ( t  = − 4.8, df  = 117; p x ̅ = 3.0; s  = 1.4) than those not used in decision making ( x ̅ = 1.8; s  = 1.2). Further, a Principal Components Analysis identifies three related components (aesthetic, narrative and name-based, and social-ecological). Given these findings, we present a framework for leveraging place in citizen science projects and platforms, and recommend approaches to better impart intended outcomes. We discuss place in citizen science related to relevance, participation, resilience, and scalability and conclude that effective decision making as a means towards more resilient and sustainable communities can be strengthened by leveraging the power of place in citizen science.",WOS:000399859000007,BIOLOGICAL CONSERVATION

ABSTRACT This article analyses the way citizen science as we know it today configures its main aspirations and dynamics as part of an open science system centered on production of and access to data. Seen in this light, we call attention to the risk of citizen science being diverted to a practice of sophisticating data collection and classification and, thus, that the democratic values which underlie the idea of open science become, more than genuine, spectacular. As an alternative, the suggestion proposed – with Alan Irwin (1993) – is to revise the understanding of citizen science as linked to the idea of citizen critique, demand, and confrontation.

Based on our experience in both authoring reproducible research and reproducing publications, we propose an ecosystem that incentivizes authors and reproducers to invest additional effort. This ecosystem consists of various building blocks, which can be combined into venue-specific profiles. A key building block is the Reproducibility Challenge, which we suggest to co-locate with the annual SIGCOMM conference to leverage reproducibility research in practice.","",""

New non-radioisotopic LLNA, LLNA:BrdU-FCM employs a non-radioisotopic analog, 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) and flow cytometry. For an analogous method, OECD TG429 performance standard (PS) advises that two reference compounds be tested repeatedly and ECt(threshold) values obtained must fall within acceptable ranges to prove within- and between-laboratory reproducibility. However, this criteria is somewhat arbitrary and sample size of ECt is less than 5, raising concerns about insufficient reliability. Here, we explored various statistical methods to evaluate the reproducibility of LLNA:BrdU-FCM with stimulation index (SI), the raw data for ECt calculation, produced from 3 laboratories. Descriptive statistics along with graphical representation of SI was presented. For inferential statistics, parametric and non-parametric methods were applied to test the reproducibility of SI of a concurrent positive control and the robustness of results were investigated. Descriptive statistics and graphical representation of SI alone could illustrate the within- and between-laboratory reproducibility. Inferential statistics employing parametric and nonparametric methods drew similar conclusion. While all labs passed within- and between-laboratory reproducibility criteria given by OECD TG429 PS based on ECt values, statistical evaluation based on SI values showed that only two labs succeeded in achieving within-laboratory reproducibility. For those two labs that satisfied the within-lab reproducibility, between-laboratory reproducibility could be also attained based on inferential as well as descriptive statistics.",WOS:000352313900003,TOXICOLOGY LETTERS

Purpose The purpose of this in vitro study was to compare the accuracy and reproducibility of a digital impression and cast fabrication with a conventional impression and cast fabrication. Material and methods Conventional impressions were made via a 1-step single viscosity technique with vinyl siloxanether material of a typodont master model, and conventional casts were cast from dental stone. Digital impressions were obtained with a digital scanner, and digital stereolithographic models were printed. The typodont and fabricated casts were digitized with a structured light scanner and saved in surface tessellation language (STL) format. All STL records were superimposed via a best-fit method. The digital impression and cast fabrication method was compared with the conventional impression and cast fabrication method for discrepancy, accuracy, and reproducibility. The Levene test was used to determine equality of variances, and a 1-way ANOVA was conducted to assess the overall statistical significance of differences among the groups (n=5, α=.05). Results No significant statistical difference was found between the digital cast and conventional casts in the internal area or finish line area ( P >.05). In addition, there was no statistically significant difference between these 2 techniques for a fixed dental prosthesis or single crown ( P >.05). However, statistically significant differences were observed for overall areas of the casts in terms of accuracy ( P P Conclusions No statistically significant difference was found between the digital cast and conventional cast groups in the internal and finish line areas. However, in terms of the reproducibility and accuracy of the entire cast area, the conventional cast was significantly better than the digital cast.","",""

However, there are invariant criteria for all fields such as the abilities to observe, measure, transmit, repeat, reproduce, verify, and falsify. These criteria allow different scientists to monitor or determine whether theories or designs related to a specific case or concept are valid and reliable. These criteria even prepare the conditions for measurability and reproducibility, which allow the opportunity for further research, as well as protect scientists from being trapped in prejudices. One of the essential criteria for science is measurability. Hence, advances in science can be claimed to develop in parallel with advances in measurement science (Erdogan, 2011; Karakac, 1988).In this respect, one can argue that compared to other science disciplines, advances in scientific fields where the investigated qualities can be directly measured are quicker, and therefore, quality measurements are comparatively easier to undertake.The situation is completely different in science disciplines such as education and psychology where the investigated qualities cannot be directly measured. In these disciplines, one attempts to predict the conditions of the related quality based on responses provided to specific stimuli; in other words, measurement is indirect (Gulliksen, 1950). However, although indirect measurement makes it possible to measure qualities that cannot be directly measured, it may also radically increase the potential error sources involved in the process. While the direction and amount of these error sources are sometimes apparent and can be identified (i.e., fixed, systematic change), sometimes they cannot (random error). This fact makes it rather hard and complex to undertake quality measurement in sciences where indirect measurement is a necessity because error sources with unidentified directions and amounts damage data reliability and impair the accuracy of the procedural comparisons that use these measurements.Scientists have developed various methods and techniques for examining reliability related to different error sources. Although these methods and techniques can be found under different classifications in different resources, they are simply classified by Crocker and Algina (1986) as methods based on multiple applications (such as equivalent forms and test-retest methods) or single application (split-half method or item-covariance-based methods). As the classification shows, some methods and techniques calculate error sources by using a single application to examine data reliability, whereas others rely on repeated measures, or scoring by multiple raters.In scientific disciplines such as education and psychology, where the investigated qualities cannot be directly measured, written, oral, and kinetic exams that require scoring by more than one rater; procedural comparisons that compare new methods and techniques developed according to scientific and technological advances; longitudinal studies; scale adaptation-development studies; and so on, are common. Reliability is the weakest link in studies where it is necessary to collect data from the same variable using different measurement tools, or to collect data from the same variable by using the same tool at different intervals (Guler & Gelbal, 2010). As a matter of fact, taking more than one measurement from the same variable also hosts the possibility of contamination from error sources as a result of interaction, both singly and in combination. Therefore, although the internal consistency of scores received from measurement tools is examined in itself, it is necessary to ensure interrater and intra-rater agreement in order to provide reliability (Guler & Gelbal, 2010; Lin, Hedayet, & Wu, 2012). In this context, agreement means similarities among measurements obtained by different inter-raters/methods. …",WOS:000395666800011,EDUCATIONAL SCIENCES-THEORY & PRACTICE

Two-dimensional shear wave elastography (2D-SWE) imaging for the noninvasive assessment of tissue stiffness was assessed for reproducibility in healthy volunteers in quantifying liver elasticity, compared with an established point shear wave elastography (p-SWE) technique also known as virtual touch quantification (VTQ) (SIEMENS).

Methods
Eleven healthy volunteers were examined by four experienced operators on two occasions, separated by two weeks (sessions A and B). Ten 2D-SWE using LOGIQ E9 and p-SWE measurements using VTQ (in meters per second) were consecutively taken from deep portions of liver segments 5 or 6 away from vascular structures, using standard techniques. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was assessed by intraclass coefficient (ICC).

Results
A total of 880 2D-SWE and p-SWE velocities were recorded. Mean values from the four operators ranged between 1.188 and 1.196 m/s for 2D-SWE and 1.170 to 1.207 m/s for p-SWE. Interobserver reproducibility was good for both sessions with ICCs of 0.88 and 0.93 (2D-SWE) and 0.87 and 0.93 (p-SWE). The overall intra-operator reproducibility between sessions A and B was good for both p-SWE and 2D-SWE with ICC of 0.87 and 0.83, respectively. For inter- and intra-observer variability, the ICC was more than or equal to 0.71, indicating that the results were reliable. There was a strong and significant correlation between the 2D-SWE and p-SWE measurements (r = 0.87, P = .0006), but their velocities did not agree equally across different velocities.

Conclusions
Two-dimensional SWE using LOGIQ E9 is a reliable and reproducible method for measuring elasticity in healthy volunteers and has a similar degree of reliability as p-SWE using VTQ, but absolute measurements from the two techniques should not be used interchangeably.",WOS:000406344700004,JOURNAL OF ULTRASOUND IN MEDICINE

The simultaneous transitions towards biology as a data science and towards a 'life cycle' view of research data pose new challenges. Researchers face a bewildering landscape of data management requirements, recommendations and regulations, without necessarily being able to access data management training or possessing a clear understanding of practical approaches that can assist in data management in their particular research domain. Here we provide an overview of best practice data life cycle approaches for researchers in the life sciences/bioinformatics space with a particular focus on 'omics' datasets and computer-based data processing and analysis. We discuss the different stages of the data life cycle and provide practical suggestions for useful tools and resources to improve data management practices.","",""

The purpose of this study was to determine the intra-session repeatability and inter-session reproducibility of axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and crystalline lens thickness (LT) measurements using the Nidek US-500 Echoscan. Method: Fifty successive automatic measurements of the above parameters were taken on the right eyes only of 12 healthy subjects aged 23–44 years old, followed by similar repeated measures after 1 week. Sample standard deviations (s.d.), precision (P) and coefficient of repeatability (COR) were calculated to determine intra-session repeatability. Coefficient of reproducibility (CRP), Bland and Altman plots, concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) and paired t -tests that compared measurements obtained in the first and second sessions, were used to determine inter-session reproducibility. Results: Both the intra-session repeatability and inter-session reproducibility were within acceptable limits for the three variables assessed. Conclusion: The study showed that the Nidek US-500 Echoscan provides accurate, repeatable and reproducible measurements of AL, ACD and LT in healthy eyes.

To evaluate repeatability and reproducibility of anterior corneal power measurements obtained with a new corneal topographer OphthaTOP (Hummel AG, Germany) and agreement with measurements by a rotating Scheimpflug camera (Pentacam HR, Oculus, Germany) and an automated keratometer (IOLMaster, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Germany).
Methods 
The right eyes of 79 healthy subjects were prospectively measured three times with all three devices. Another examiner performed three additional scans with the OphthaTOP in the same session. Within one week, the first examiner repeated the measurements using the OphthaTOP. The flat simulated keratometry (Kf), steep K (Ks), mean K (Km), J0, and J45 were noted. Repeatability and reproducibility of measurements were assessed by within-subject standard deviation (Sw), repeatability (2.77 Sw), coefficient of variation (CoV), and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Agreement between devices was assessed using 95% limits of agreement (LoA).
Results 
Intraobserver repeatability and interobserver and intersession reproducibility of all measured parameters showed a 2.77 Sw of 0.29 diopter or less, a CoV of less than 0.24%, and an ICC of more than 0.906. Statistically significant differences (P<0.001) were found between the parameters analyzed by the three devices, except J0 and J45. The mean differences between OphthaTOP and the other two devices were small, and the 95% LoA was narrow for all results.
Conclusions 
The OphthaTOP showed excellent intraobserver repeatability and interobserver and intersession reproducibility of corneal power measurements. Good agreements with the other two devices in these parameters were found in healthy eyes.",WOS:000348102200001,PLOS ONE

The results indicate that those elements that are most suitable for geochemical characterization, such as rare earth elements (REE), high-field strength elements (HFSE) and certain mobile elements (Rb, Sr, Th, U), show excellent reproducibility with an average relative standard deviation (RSD) of 3% between open-beaker and pressured ‘bomb’ digestion methods. This observation rules out the presence of refractory phases such as zircon, which can only dissolve in pressured ‘bombs’, and suggests that the results from open-beaker digestion are reliable. The ICP–MS data for powders of different weights ranging from 10 to 100 mg collected from two fine-grained basalt artefacts display excellent reproducibility, with a RSD of <5% for the most important elements. The reproducibility is reduced when including the 5 mg weight fraction (RSD of ~2–9%), which is still sufficient for archaeological applications.

If this hypothesis is held as true, we must explain why these experiments were difficult to reproduce by other teams and why some blind experiments were so disturbing for the expected outcomes. In this article, a third way is proposed by modeling these experiments in a quantum-like probabilistic model. It is interesting to note that this model does not need the hypothesis of the “memory of water” and, nevertheless, all the features of Benveniste’s experiments are taken into account (emergence of a signal from the background, difficulties faced by other teams in terms of reproducibility, disturbances during blind experiments, and apparent “jumps of activity” between samples).

Objective: To demonstrate the reproducibility of the AFQLQ version 2 (AFQLQ v.2), which included the domains of fatigue, illness perception and well-being. Methods: We applied 160 questionnaires (AFQLQ v.2 and SF-36) to 40 patients, at baseline and 15 days after, to measure inter- and intraobserver reproducibility. The analysis of quality of life stability was determined by test-retest, applying the Bartko intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Internal consistency was assessed by Cronbach's alpha test.

Lack of transparency is common in science, and is encouraged by journals that place more emphasis on the aesthetic appeal of a manuscript than the robustness of its scientific claims. In doing this, journals are implicitly encouraging authors to do whatever it takes to obtain eye-catching results. To achieve this, researchers can use common research practices that beautify results at the expense of the robustness of those results (e.g., p-hacking). The problem is not engaging in these practices, but failing to disclose them. A car whose carburetor is duct-taped to the rest of the car might work perfectly fine, but the buyer has a right to know about the duct-taping. Without high levels of transparency in scientific publications, consumers of scientific manuscripts are in a similar position as buyers of used cars – they cannot reliably tell the difference between lemons and high quality findings. This phenomenon – quality uncertainty – has been shown to erode trust in economic markets, such as the used car market. The same problem threatens to erode trust in science. The solution is to increase transparency and give consumers of scientific research the information they need to accurately evaluate research. Transparency would also encourage researchers to be more careful in how they conduct their studies and write up their results. To make this happen, we must tie journals’ reputations to their practices regarding transparency. Reviewers hold a great deal of power to make this happen, by demanding the transparency needed to rigorously evaluate scientific manuscripts. The public expects transparency from science, and appropriately so – we should be held to a higher standard than used car salespeople.","",""

This has created confusion among the orthodontic students and clinicians regarding its construction. Objective: To evaluate two commonly used methods of constructing the nasolabial angle in order to establish a single reproducible method. Materials & Method: Lateral cephalograms of 120 patients undergoing orthodontic treatment were obtained from the records of the patients. Soft tissue profile on the lateral cephalograms were traced manually by the principal investigator. All the tracings were photocopied and 6 copies of each tracing were made. Nasolabial angles were constructed and measured on photocopied copies of the tracings first using the anatomic point method and then using the tangent line method by the principal investigator and another investigator independently. Result: The average nasolabial angle values for anatomic point method and tangent line method were found to be 94.32° ± 14.05° and 92.4° ± 14.59° respectively. The intra-class correlation coefficient demonstrated excellent intra-observer and interobserver agreement among the two methods of nasolabial angle construction.

Disquietingly, the problem seems to be getting worse rather than better.10 Although the causes of irreproducibility are multifarious, inadequate rigor is probably the most important2,11; thus, it will be impossible to augment reproducibility without augmenting methodological rigor. It is not the purpose of this editorial to revisit the nature, origins, mechanisms, and consequences of irreproducibility, all of which have been discussed innumerable times in recent years, both in the literature and in ad hoc workshops.1–12 There has been enough discussion; now it is time for action.

Much of this action must come from editors. Publication of methodologically flawed or suboptimal research can be limited by promulgating, and diligently applying, higher standards during editorial evaluation of submitted work. The editors of Circulation Research believe that the journal has a responsibility to implement initiatives that promote more rigorous and, therefore, more reproducible scientific work. It is for this reason that Circulation Research has published several reviews, editorials, Viewpoints, and News & Views articles focused on this issue.1,2,7–12 It is for this reason that the journal has joined other leading journals to promote reproducibility of biomedical research4 by endorsing the National Institutes of Health principles and guidelines for reporting preclinical research,6 and it is for this very reason that we have recently chosen to publish a study showing that only a minority of preclinical animal experiments reported in leading cardiovascular journals (including Circulation Research ) adheres to basic criteria necessary to assure rigor: for …",WOS:000407776500003,CIRCULATION RESEARCH

Our paper aims to fill this gap and explores the motivations of firms that disclose research outcomes in a scientific format. Besides considering a dimension internal to the firm, we focus particularly on knowledge sourcing from academic institutions and the appropriability regime. We conduct an econometric analysis with firm-level data from the fourth edition of the French innovation survey (CIS) and matched scientific publications for a sample of 2512 R&D performing firms from all manufacturing sectors. This analysis provides evidence that firms are more likely to adopt academic principles if they need to access scientific knowledge that is considered important for their innovation development, whereas the mere existence of collaborative links with academic institutions is not a strong determinant. Furthermore, the results suggest that the inclination of firms to publish is sensitive to the level of knowledge spillovers in a sector and the effectiveness of legal appropriation instruments.",WOS:000326557600002,RESEARCH POLICY

Using a exploratory approach, the study tested whether a consensus exists among advocates of these initiatives about the key concepts, exploring the meanings that scientists attach to the various mechanisms for sharing their work, and the social context in which this takes place. The study used a purposive sampling strategy to target scientists who have been active participants in these advocacy efforts, and an open-ended questionnaire to collect detailed opinions on the topics of reproducibility, credibility, scooping, data sharing, results sharing, and the effectiveness of the peer review process. We found evidence of a lack of agreement on the meaning of key terminology, and a lack of consensus on some of the broader goals of these advocacy efforts. These results can be explained through a closer examination of the divergent goals and approaches adopted by different advocacy efforts.

Due to the testing of a large number of hypotheses and relatively small sample sizes, results from whole-genome expression studies in particular are often not reproducible. Compared to single-study analysis, gene expression meta-analysis can improve reproducibility by integrating data from multiple studies. However, there are multiple choices in designing and carrying out a meta-analysis. Yet, clear guidelines on best practices are scarce. Here, we hypothesized that studying subsets of very large meta-analyses would allow for systematic identification of best practices to improve reproducibility. We therefore constructed three very large gene expression meta-analyses from clinical samples, and then examined meta-analyses of subsets of the datasets (all combinations of datasets with up to N/2 samples and K/2 datasets) compared to a ‘silver standard’ of differentially expressed genes found in the entire cohort. We tested three random-effects meta-analysis models using this procedure. We showed relatively greater reproducibility with more-stringent effect size thresholds with relaxed significance thresholds; relatively lower reproducibility when imposing extraneous constraints on residual heterogeneity; and an underestimation of actual false positive rate by Benjamini–Hochberg correction. In addition, multivariate regression showed that the accuracy of a meta-analysis increased significantly with more included datasets even when controlling for sample size.",WOS:000396575100001,NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH

Our research points out that open notebook science is not an incremental improvement, but it is a new “literary technology” (Shapin, Shaffer, 1985) and main element of a complex open collaboration ecosystem that fosters a new epistemic culture (Knorr-Cetina, 1999). This innovation aimed to move from a “science based on trust” to a science based on transparency and data provenance - a shift that recognizes the ability of scientists in performing experiments, but mostly, values their capacity of documenting properly what they say they have done. The theoretical framework was built with the notion of epistemic culture (Knorr-Cetina, 1999) and the “three technologies” perspective used by Shapin and Shaffer (1985) to describe the construction by natural philosophers of “matter of fact” as “variety of knowledge” so powerful that became synonymous of science itself. Empirically, we entered the “open lab” through a netnography that led us to understand that the epistemic culture being engendered by its practitioners is based on a “matter of proof”.","",""

This paper argues that to manage the transition to the Open Access (OA) model of scholarly publishing we need to understand better what enables, encourages and inhibits the adoption of OA publishing among scientists, and to appreciate individual differences within disciplines. The study adopts a psychological perspective to elucidate motivations, capabilities and opportunities for OA publishing among bio-scientists in the UK. To identify individual differences within the discipline we interview bio-scientists with starkly different past practices for disclosing research data and technologies. Content analysis of the interview data reveals that the sampled bio-scientists face similar obstacles and enablers in their physical environment, but that their motivations and experience of their social environments differ. One group is strongly motivated to adopt OA publishing - mainly by their moral convictions and beliefs that OA benefits themselves, other scientists and society - and feels peer pressure related to OA. The other group expresses fewer pro-OA beliefs, holds beliefs that are demotivating towards adoption of OA publishing, but feels pressure from research funders to adopt this form of publishing. Our quantitative analysis reveals that the former group makes more frequent use of OA publishing compared to the latter group, which suggests that only those with strong motivations will work to overcome the obstacles in their social and physical environments. The individual differences within the discipline suggest that bio-scientists are unlikely to respond to OA policies in the same way and, thus, we question the appropriateness of one-size-fits-all OA policies. We show that psychological analyses of scientists’ behaviour can inform the design of more targeted policies and organisational interventions aimed at steering a transition to the OA model of academic publishing.","",""

The success of these programs depends on the validity of published findings. This validity, represented by the reproducibility of published findings, has come into question recently as investigators from companies have raised the issue of poor reproducibility of published results from academic laboratories. Furthermore, retraction rates in high impact journals are climbing. Methods and Findings: To examine a microcosm of the academic experience with data reproducibility, we surveyed the faculty and trainees at MD Anderson Cancer Center using an anonymous computerized questionnaire; we sought to ascertain the frequency and potential causes of non-reproducible data. We found that ,50% of respondents had experienced at least one episode of the inability to reproduce published data; many who pursued this issue with the original authors were never able to identify the reason for the lack of reproducibility; some were even met with a less than ‘‘collegial’’ interaction. Conclusions: These results suggest that the problem of data reproducibility is real.

While these techniques are more and more commonly employed, surprisingly little information is known about the quality rendering of digitalized three-dimensional (3D) models provided by each of them. This paper presents findings related to the measurement precision of 3D models obtained through observation of a study case, where a fractured skull reconstructed by an anthropologist was digitalized using both post-mortem imaging methods. Computed tomography (CT) scans were performed using an 8-row MDCT unit with two different slice thicknesses. The variability of 3D CT models superimposition allowed to assess the reproducibility and robustness of this digitalization technique. Furthermore, two 3D surface scans were done using a professional high resolution 3D digitizer. The comparison of 3D CT-scans wi...","",""

However, because this dataset was acquired only from a single group under a single condition, we cannot directly evaluate whether the rs-fMRI measures can generate reproducible between-condition or between-group results. Because the modulation of resting state activity has gained increasing attention, it is important to know whether one rs-fMRI metric can reliably detect the alteration of the resting activity. Here, we shared a public Eyes-Open (EO)/Eyes-Closed (EC) dataset for evaluating the split-half reproducibility of the rs-fMRI measures in detecting changes of the resting state activity between EO and EC. As examples, we assessed the split-half reproducibility of three widely applied rs-fMRI metrics: amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and seed-based correlation analysis. Our results demonstrated that reproducible patterns of EO-EC differences can be detected by all three measures, suggesting the feasibility of the EO/EC dataset for performing reproducibility assessment for other rs-fMRI measures.",WOS:000325767100006,NEUROINFORMATICS

Thus, any change made to the application, the hardware, or the software on the system needs to preserve the bit wise reproducibility of the application.

Design A comparative prospective study (May 2008–May 2012). Setting University-affiliated infertility clinic. Patient(s) Eighty-six healthy oocyte donors, regularly cycling, aged 20–34 years with a body mass index (BMI) of 19–25 kg/m 2 . Intervention(s) Endometrial biopsies were collected throughout the menstrual cycle. For the accuracy study, 79 samples were grouped into two cohorts: the training set (n = 79) for ERA machine-learning training and dating, and a dating subset (n = 49) for comparison between histologic and ERA dating. For the reproducibility study, seven women underwent ERA testing and it was repeated in the same patients on the same day of their cycle 29–40 months later. Main Outcome Measure(s) Concordance of histologic and ERA dating related to LH as a reference, and interobserver variability between pathologists were statistically analyzed by the quadratic weighted Kappa index. The ERA reproducibility was tested and its gene expression visualized by principal component analysis. Result(s) For each pathologist, concordance against LH peak yielded values of 0.618 (0.446–0.791) and 0.685 (0.545–0.824). Interobserver variability between pathologists yielded a Kappa index of 0.622 (0.435–0.839). Concordance for ERA dating against LH peak showed a value of 0.922 (0.815–1.000).

Megajournals (of which PLoS One is the best known example) represent a relatively new approach to scholarly communication and can be characterized as large, broad-scope, open access journals that take an innovative approach to peer review, basing acceptance decisions solely on the technical or scientific soundness of the article. This model is often said to support the broader goals of the open science movement. Based on in-depth interviews with 31 publishers and editors representing 16 different organizations (10 of which publish a megajournal), this paper reports how the term ‘megajournal’ is understood and publishers’ rationale and motivations for launching (or not launching) an OAMJ. We find that while there is general agreement on the common characteristics of megajournals, there is not yet a consensus on their relative importance. We also find seven motivating factors that were said to drive the launch of an OAMJ and link each of these factors to potential societal and business benefits. These results suggest that the often polarized debate surrounding OAMJs is a consequence of the extent to which observers perceive publishers to be motivated by these societal or business benefits.",WOS:000412116600006,LEARNED PUBLISHING

Six clinical patient plans were delivered to a variety of devices and analyses, including 1) radiographic film; 2) ion chamber; 3) 2D diode array delivered and analyzed in three different configurations (AP delivery with field-by-field analysis, AP delivery with composite analysis, and planned gantry angle delivery); 4) helical diode array; and 5) in-house–designed multiple ion chamber phantom. The six clinical plans were selected from a range of treatment sites and were of various levels of complexity. Of note, three of the plans had failed at least preliminary evaluation with our in-house IMRT QA; the other three plans had passed QA. These plans were delivered three times sequentially without changing the setup, and then delivered two more times after breaking down and rebuilding the setup between each. This allowed for an investigation of reproducibility (in terms of dose, dose difference or percent of pixels passing gamma) of both the delivery and the physical setup. This study showed that the variability introduced from the setup was generally higher than the variability from redelivering the plan. Radiographic film showed the poorest reproducibility of the dosimeters investigated. In conclusion, the various IMRT QA systems demonstrated varying abilities to reproduce QA results consistently. All dosimetric devices demonstrated a reproducibility (coefficient of variation) of less than 4% in their QA results for all plans, with an average reproducibility of less than 2%. This work provides some quantification for the variability that may be seen for IMRT QA dosimeters.","",""

Twenty-two subjects were evaluated twice in the same experimental conditions (3 days interval). Two inertial sensors allowed the evaluation of the range of movement of the head. Three complete cycles of movements were realised in each plane. A patient suffering from cervical dystonia was also evaluated with the same protocol before and after self-training program. Results show a good reproducibility for all ranges of movement except for the associated movements realised in the sagittal plane. Thereafter, our protocol allowed us to notice an improvement of the kinematics of the head after the self-training program followed by the patient. These results show the reproducibility of the inertial sensors as evaluation tools for head movements, a change in the proposed method will allow a generalization to cervical movements.","",""

Within the Open Science discussions, the current call for “reproducibility” comes from the raising awareness that results as presented in research papers are not as easily reproducible as expected, or even contradicted those original results in some reproduction efforts. In this context, transparency and openness are seen as key components to facilitate good scientific practices, as well as scientific discovery. As a result, many funding agencies now require the deposit of research data sets, institutions improve the training on the application of statistical methods, and journals begin to mandate a high level of detail on the methods and materials used. How can researchers be supported and encouraged to provide that level of transparency? An important component is the underlying research data, which is currently often only partly available within the article. At Elsevier we have therefore been working on journal data guidelines which clearly explain to researchers when and how they are expected to make their research data available. Simultaneously, we have also developed the corresponding infrastructure to make it as easy as possible for researchers to share their data in a way that is appropriate in their field. To ensure researchers get credit for the work they do on managing and sharing data, all our journals support data citation in line with the FORCE11 data citation principles – a key step in the direction of ensuring that we address the lack of credits and incentives which emerged from the Open Data analysis (Open Data - the Researcher Perspective https://www.elsevier.com/about/open-science/research-data/open-data-report ) recently carried out by Elsevier together with CWTS. Finally, the presentation will also touch upon a number of initiatives to ensure the reproducibility of software, protocols and methods. With STAR methods, for instance, methods are submitted in a Structured, Transparent, Accessible Reporting format; this approach promotes rigor and robustness, and makes reporting easier for the author and replication easier for the reader.","",""

The delayed adoption of this technique for cognitive studies may stem partly from a lack of information on the reproducibility of these measures in the context of cognitive tasks. In this study we have explored the applicability and reproducibility of a state-of-the-art calibrated BOLD technique using a complex functional task at 7 tesla. Reproducibility measures of BOLD, CBF, CMRO2 flow-metabolism coupling n and the calibration parameter M were compared and interpreted for three ROIs. We found an averaged intra-subject variation of CMRO2 of 8% across runs and 33% across days. BOLD (46% across runs, 36% across days), CBF (33% across runs, 46% across days) and M (41% across days) showed significantly higher intra-subject variability. Inter-subject variability was found to be high for all quantities, though CMRO2 was the most consistent across brain regions.

Nonetheless, despite being one of the most developed countries in Latin America, Chile imports most of the knowledge and technology necessary to drive innovation in the country. The tight budget that the Chilean government assigned to research and development and the absence of a long-term scientific agenda contributed to a limited supply of scientists over the years. In an effort to reverse this scenario, Chile has created several fellowships, such as the Becas Chile Program (BCP) to encourage new generations to pursue graduate studies to ultimately advance research and development in situ. More than 6000 fellows are now being trained abroad, accumulating an incredible potential to transform the Chilean scientific environment as we know it.  Chile now faces a greater challenge: it has to offer infrastructure and job openings to the highly skilled professionals in whom it invested. Unfortunately no clear public policies to address this situation have been developed, partially due to the lack of a dedicated institution, such as a Ministry for Science and Technology which could focalize the necessary efforts to promote such policies. Therefore, in the meantime, Chilean scientist have been motivated to create different organizations, such as, Mas Ciencia para Chile and Nexos Chile-USA, to promote constructive discussion of the policies that could be implemented to improve the Chilean scientific situation. We hope that these and other organizations have a real impact on the generation of scientific guidelines that will finally contribute to the development of the country.","",""

Clinical reproducibility of three electronic apex locators. International Endodontic Journal, 44, 769–776, 2011. Aim To compare the reproducibility of three electronic apex locators (EALs), Dentaport ZX, RomiApex A-15 and Raypex 5, under clinical conditions. Methodology Forty-eight root canals of incisors, canines and premolars with or without radiographically confirmed periapical lesions required root canal treatment in 42 patients. In each root canal, all three EALs were used to determine the working length (WL) that was defined as the zero reading and indicated by ‘Apex’, ‘0.0’ or ‘red square’ markings on the EAL display. A new K-file of the same size was used for each measurement. The file length was fixed with a rubber stop and measured to an accuracy of 0.01 mm. Measurements were undertaken by two calibrated operators. Differences in zero readings between the three EALs in the same root canal were statistically analysed using paired t-tests with the Bonferroni correction, Bland‐Altman plot and Linn’s concordance correlation coefficients at a = 0.05. Results Mean and standard deviation values measured by the three EALs showed no statistically significant differences. Identical readings by all three EALs were found in 10.4% of root canals. Forty-three per cent of readings differed by less than ±0.5 mm and 31.3% exceeded a difference of ±1 mm. Conclusions The clinical reproducibility of Dentaport ZX, RomiApex A-15 and Raypex 5 was confirmed with the majority of readings within the ±1.0 mm range. However, the small number of identical zero readings suggests that EALs are not reliable as the sole means of WL determination under clinical conditions.",WOS:000292336400008,INTERNATIONAL ENDODONTIC JOURNAL

Results: The agreement ( K values) between observations (T0 versus T1) for each examiner ranged from 0.49 to 0.72. The overall agreement was 0.65 [95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54–0.75]. The agreement in the group with less clinical experience was 0.61 (95% CI = 0.46–0.76), while it was 0.68 (95% CI = 0.53–0.83) in the more experienced group. The amount of clinical experience did not affect intra-observer agreement ( P = 0.50). The overall agreement between the examiners and the trainer was 0.74 (95% CI = 0.65–0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI = 0.64–0.83) at T0 and T1 respectively.

Conclusion: The assessment of the Frankel manoeuvre is reproducible and it is not influenced by the amount of clinical experience.",WOS:000383207100012,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS

The research methods commonly used by psychologists, especially the statistical analyses used to analyze experimental data, are under scrutiny. The lack of reproducible research findings in psychology and the paucity of published studies attempting to replicate psychology studies have been widely reported (e.g., Pashler and Wagenmakers, 2012; Ioannidis et al., 2014; Open Science Collaboration, 2015). Although it is encouraging that people are aware of problems evident in mainstream psychology research and taking actions to correct them (e.g., Open Science Collaboration, 2015), one problem has received little or no attention: the reliance on between-subjects research designs. The reliance on group comparisons is arguably the most fundamental problem at hand because such designs are what often necessitate the kinds of statistical analyses that have led to psychology's professional crisis (Sidman, 1960; Michael, 1974; Parsonson and Baer, 1978). But there is an alternative.

Single-case designs involve the intensive study of individual subjects using repeated measures of performance, with each subject exposed to the independent variable(s) and each subject serving as their own control (Sidman, 1960; Barlow et al., 2008; Johnston and Pennypacker, 2009; Kazdin, 2010). Comparisons of performance under baseline and experimental conditions are made for each subject, with any experimental effects replicated with the individual subject across time or across multiple subjects in the same experiment. Single-case experiments yield data that can be interpreted using non-inferential statistics and visual analysis of graphed data, a strategy characteristic of other natural sciences (Best et al., 2001). Single-case experimental designs are advantageous because they more readily permit the intensive investigation of each subject and they achieve replication within an experiment rather than across experiments. Thus, data from just a few subjects tells a story.",WOS:000377959000001,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY

The measurement system included a soft measurement tool (a counting method for the number of successful recognitions), appraisers, measured objects (recognition results of 300 occluded tomato images), the usage method for the soft measurement tool and measurement environments. The measurement system was analysed on the basis of its repeatability and reproducibility. Repeatability and reproducibility were both evaluated based on Fleiss's Kappa values, free-marginal multirater Kappa values and Kendall coefficients. Test results showed that repeatability was excellent or fair to good based on Fleiss's Kappa values and excellent based on free-marginal multirater Kappa values and Kendall coefficients for the three appraisers. Further improvement in the soft type of measurement tool is necessary.

Whilst this information can be obtained directly from the data providers, the resulting formats, temporal aggregations, and vocabularies may not be homogeneous across datasets. Moreover, different data policies hold for the different databases, being only some of them publicly available. Therefore, obtaining and harmonizing multi-model seasonal forecast data for sector-specific applications is an error-prone, time consuming task. In order to facilitate this, the ECOMS User Data Gateway (ECOMS-UDG) was developed in the framework of the ECOMS initiative as a one-stop-service for climate data. To this aim, the variables required by end users were identified, downloaded from the data providers and locally stored as virtual datasets in a THREDDS Data Server (TDS), implementing fine-grained user management and authorization via the THREDDS Access Portal (TAP). As a result, users can retrieve the subsets best suited to their particular research needs in a user-friendly manner using the standard TDS data services. Moreover, an open source, R-based interface for data access and postprocessing was developed in the form of a bundle of packages implementing harmonized data access (one single vocabulary), data collocation, bias adjustment and downscaling, and forecast visualization and validation. This provides a unique comprehensive framework for end-to-end applications of seasonal predictions, hence favoring the reproducibility of the ECOMS scientific outcomes, extensible to the whole scientific community.","",""

The World Health Organization has identified diabetes to be globally “epidemic”, and points out the need to increase awareness of this status [1]. The chronic nature of these diseases, their long term impact on both patients and their families, and the fact that a definitive “cure” is still missing justifies the involvement of a large number of researchers and clinicians in these areas. This in turn results in numerous publications as a mean of spreading the gathered experiences and obtained knowledge and ultimately aiming to improve the patients’ well-being. The Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders (JDMD) is launched with the hope of contributing to the efforts made to reach this goal.

JDMD is the continuation of our previous publication, the Iranian Journal of Diabetes and Lipid Disorders, an electronic-only journal that published a total of 63 articles between 2008 and 2011. JDMD is owned by the Endocrinology and Metabolism Research Institute (EMRI), a center of excellence and a World Health Organization (WHO) collaborator in the prevention, diagnosis and management of Diabetes and Osteoporosis. EMRI is affiliated to Tehran University of Medical Sciences which is the first and most outstanding academic medical center at national level. The journal will cover a broad range of subjects related to endocrinology such as clinical and epidemiological studies on metabolic diseases and their complications, as well as novel and emerging therapeutics and related basic sciences studies, to name a few specific subjects. Two particular topics, namely “Aging” and “Interdisciplinary Research” are intended to be the subjects of special issues. Like its predecessor, JDMD is a peer-reviewed journal and, after acceptance, articles will be immediately published online, and soon after indexed in PubMed. All articles submitted to JDMD will be peer reviewed by our Editorial Board (http://www.jdmdonline.com/about/edboard) and, after acceptance, will be immediately published online, and soon after indexed in PubMed.

The aim of the changes made to the journal is to move to a more dynamic scheme of publication, which will be more in line with the current modes of scientific communication and spread of health-related information. With the wide dissemination of new communication technologies, and the trend toward “open science”, methods are debated to make the best from new models of data publishing [2]. As an open access journal, JDMD articles will be freely available to all potential readers, leading to a broader audience and higher visibility of articles [3]. Presently, although JDMD is an open-access journal, all publishing costs are covered by the Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

A multidisciplinary approach to endocrinology problems has been a central paradigm in the research activities of EMRI during the past seventeen years; the same spirit is intended to be present in the journal, which will propose a variety of themes. We rely on the distinguished scientists that form the Editorial Board to ensure the quality of published articles in these diverse subjects.

Finally, a journal’s success and impact depends directly on the publication of the hard work of researchers in the field. As such, we would welcome you to submit your research to Journal of Diabetes & Metabolic Disorders in order to promote it towards becoming one of the top journals in its field.",WOS:000215516200001,JOURNAL OF DIABETES AND METABOLIC DISORDERS

Once implemented, those systems are often not further maintained and updated, rendering the stored information useless once the system stops operating. The River Basin Information System (RBIS) presented here is designed to fit not only the requirements of one research project, but focuses on generic functions, extensibility and standards compliance typically found in interdisciplinary environmental research. Developed throughout more than 10 years of research cooperation worldwide, RBIS is designed to manage different types of environmental data with and without spatial context together with a rich set of metadata. Beside data management and storage, RBIS provides functions for the visualization, linking, analysis and processing of different types of data to support research, decision making, result dissemination and information discovery for all kinds of users. The focus of this paper is on the description of the technical implementation and the presentation of functions.

One of the key aspects of such models is the ability to reproduce the results in different software and hardware. In general, the simulation of these models are carried out under floating point standards. It is well known that by limitation of computer arithmetic, the results may be different when the combination of hardware and software is also different. In such case, the evaluation of the reproducibility of MAS is harder than deterministic models, as it is usually seen as stochastic process. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to verify if two simulations of a MAS keep the same statistical properties. Computational simulations illustrate the efficience of the technique as a tool to verify the reproducibility of a MAS.","",""

The objective of this study is to verify the potential effect of hand rotation during X-ray imaging on the measurement of joint space width using CAJSA and to evaluate the reproducibility of the CAJSA technique in healthy subjects and in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Methods All joint space distance (JSD) measurements were performed using CAJSA-technology at the metacarpophalangeal articulation based on conventional and digital hand radiographs. Results I. Hand rotation showed an effect on the reproducibility with CV ranging between 0.39% (angulation 1°) and 1.66% (angulation 19°). II. Regarding the overall reproducibility of the CAJSA method, the intra-radiograph reproducibility of JSD was calculated with CV = 0.54% for conventional images and CV = 0.38% for digital images. The inter-radiograph reproducibility error was observed with CV = 0.66% (conventional images) and CV = 0.63% (digital images). III. The study revealed a reproducibility for CAJSA measurements in RA ranging between 0.37% (JSD-MCP ring finger; van der Heijde-modification of the Sharp method Score 1) to 1.37% (JSD-MCP index finger; van der Heijde-modification of the Sharp method Score 3). Conclusion CAJSA measures JSD at the metacarpophalangeal articulation with high reproducibility in healthy subjects and in patients with differing stages of rheumatoid arthritis. Additional findings show that hand rotation during X-ray imaging has an impact on the CAJSA measurements; thus avoiding acquisition of hand radiographs with a rotation error of more than 15 degrees can be recommended.",WOS:000306089000012,JOINT BONE SPINE

The AO and Lauge-Hansen classification systems are widely used in the clinical diagnosis of ankle injuries. This study aimed to analyze the intraobserver reliability and interobserver reproducibility of the AO and Lauge-Hansen classification systems. In addition, the authors explored the differences among physicians' classification responses and evaluated the clinical value for diagnosis. Fifty-six patients with an ankle injury with complete clinical and radiologic data were enrolled. The definition of injury type, the index score typing methods, and the specific study criteria were explained in detail. Five observers, who were orthopedic surgeons, determined the classifications according to both the AO and Lauge-Hansen systems. The classification was repeated 1 month later. Cronbach's alpha and Cohen's kappa test were used to determine interobserver reliability and intraobserver reproducibility. The physicians conducted 560 classifications (56 cases × 5 physicians × 2 times per patient). Average inter- and intraobserver kappa values for the AO system were 0.708 and 0.608, respectively. Average inter- and intraobserver kappa values for the Lauge-Hansen system were 0.402 and 0.398, respectively. Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 96.7% for the AO system and 76.0% for the Lauge-Hansen system. The Lauge-Hansen classification system is a comprehensive yet cumbersome system. Comparatively, the AO classification system is easier to understand.

This is a well-done study, and the conclusions follow from the results. We would recommend accepting the article once all clarifications and revisions have been made, or the lack of doing so adequately justified.

A. While brevity is generally to be admired, we would recommend a bit more detail about the statistical analyses. These are critical, but are reduced to 3 sentences and a referral to the programming language through an external link. We would suggest that the main text include the (brief) discussion of the analyses done, and rationale for them, rather than have those relegated to the external link.

B. The interpretation of the findings seems to be attributing causal factors - an A leads to B consideration - for which the control of variables is too limited. We believe that interpreting these as associations would be more consistent with the findings.

Consider the statement: \"Journals and editors should also think carefully about the optimum number of peer reviewers per paper. With each extra reviewer, we found that an extra 7.4 days are added to the review process.\" Given that there appeared to be no inclusion of either article quality or complexity in the evaluation, is it not possible that issues within the article itself required the use of additional reviewers (i.e. a B leads to A perspective)? Perhaps extra reviewers with specific expertise was required, or concerns with potential problems in the manuscript led to consultations with other reviewers. It does not seem safe to assume that it was the addition of the reviewer that added extra days.

Similarly, the study centers around the role of the editor in the reviewing process, and the discussion suggested that the involvement of the reviewing editor as a peer reviewer expedited the process. There was little discussion of other factors that could have accounted for the statistical results. For example, perhaps the reviewing editor selected articles that piqued his or her interest, or were more clearly presented. Perhaps the reviewing editor selected to review at times more convenient to his or her workload, while other reviewers did not have such an option. The reviewing editor might select to review articles perceived to be of greater or timelier value to the journal itself, which may increase the speed of the review. 

Specific questions:

A. According to their method section, the authors state that they began with an initial N=9,589. After purging other articles they had an N=8,905. They then isolated a total of 2,750 articles subjected to the peer review process for the study: \"For the rest of the paper, we focus our analysis on this subset of 2,750 papers, of which 1,405 had been accepted, 1,099 had been rejected, and the rest [which would equal 246] were still under consideration.\"

Looking at the Excel spreadsheet for citation counts, there are 1407 lines with entry numbers. For peer-reviewed papers, excel spreadsheet has 2747 (after removing duplicate entries based on the MS NO column) entries for manuscripts numbered up to 12621. The excel spreadsheet for unique reviewers has 2747 entries, with a final MS NO of 12621.

The numbers do not appear to match, and there is no explanation for that in methods. Exactly how many manuscripts were reviewed, how many rejected and why, and how many were tracked?

B. In the Excel spreadsheet for citations, the second column was titled \"Citations,\" but these figures do not appear to have any relation to the Scopus citation numbers. What numbers were used for the actual citation counts?

We also note that we find the suggestions by other reviewers compelling, and would be happy to review a revision of this manuscript should that be considered useful.

We have read this submission. We believe that we have an appropriate level of expertise to confirm that it is of an acceptable scientific standard, however we have significant reservations, as outlined above.","",""

To easily determine the sensor system quality, a mobile sensor test application for smartphones was published recently. Although this test has several advantages, it lacks reproducibility and repeatability . As a remedy, we designed a special user interface that guides the operator through the test and helps judging the quality of the test conductance. While poorly conducted tests are neglected, only the meaningful ones are evaluated, so that our technology enables a more detailed analysis of the sensor systems. In this paper, we propose a statistical approach capable to distinguish between the four most important systematic errors we observed. Experiments with five state-of-the-art smartphones show that reproducibility and repeatability were significantly improved, enabling a fair comparison of the smartphone sensor systems.","",""

In order for an eScience experiment to be reproducible, we need to able to identify precisely the data set which was used in a study. Considering evolving data sources this can be a challenge, as studies often use subsets which have been extracted from a potentially large parent data set. Exporting and storing subsets in multiple versions does not scale with large amounts of data sets. For tackling this challenge, the RDA Working Group on Data Citation has developed a framework and provides a set of recommendations, which allow identifying precise subsets of evolving data sources based on versioned data and timestamped queries. In this work, we describe how this method can be applied in small scale research data scenarios and how it can be implemented in large scale data facilities having access to sophisticated data infrastructure. We describe how the RDA approach improves the reproducibility of eScience experiments and we provide an overview of existing pilots and use cases in small and large scale settings.","",""

Regarding sound insulation measurements, both the pressure method (ISO 10140-2) and the intensity method (ISO 15186-1 and ISO 15186-3) are investigated in the frequency range 50-200 Hz.

However, very little is known about the training needs of these editors or what competencies are required to perform effectively in this role.

Methods: We conducted a survey of perceptions and training needs among scientific editors from major editorial organizations around the world, followed by a modified Delphi process in which we invited the same scientific editors to rate the importance of competency-related statements obtained from a previous scoping review.

Results: A total of 148 participants completed the survey of perceptions and training needs. At least 80% of participants agreed on six of the 38 skill and expertise-related statements presented to them as being important or very important to their role as scientific editors. At least 80% agreed on three of the 38 statements as necessary skills they perceived themselves as possessing (well or very well). The top five items on participants’ list of top training needs were training in statistics, research methods, publication ethics, recruiting and dealing with peer reviewers, and indexing of journals. The three rounds of the Delphi were completed by 83, 83, and 73 participants, respectively, which ultimately produced a list of 23 “highly rated” competency-related statements and another 86 “included” items.

Conclusion: Both the survey and the modified Delphi process will be critical for understanding knowledge and training gaps among scientific editors when designing curriculum around core competencies in the future.","",""

Materials and Methods: The study material consisted of Twenty five lateral cephalograms selected randomly, 16 cephalometric points together with 10 angular and 5 linear cephalometric measurements. The landmarks were manually picked on the tracing & the measurements of X &Y axis done with reference grid. The same tracing was digitized & image loaded in the software (ViewBox 3.1.1) was checked for the magnification (metal ruler) & distortion. The second part of the study compared manual and the CADCAS since the landmarks were manually digitized on screen as against the manually picked ones on the tracing paper. The x and y-coordinates for 16 landmarks were measured, mean and standard deviation calculated, linear and angular measurements compared. Statistical Analysis: A paired t-test was done to calculate the statistical significance of the differences. Intraclass reliability coefficient (signifying reproducibility) of the variable was recorded. The observations were tabulated and analysis was done using the paired t test at a P value Results: Out of 47 variables looked for, 21 showed statistical significance. Direct digitization onscreen (CADCAS) was the quickest and least tedious method. CADCAS was unreliable with linear measurements involving bilateral structures such as Gonion & Articulare. Conclusions: Both the methods are equally reliable and reproducible. The intra- class reliability coefficient of all variables differed only slightly, which is not clinically significant.","",""

Many of these issues, however, have little to do with HHpXRF itself and more to do with an artificial crisis triggered by specialists' concerns about a hitherto restricted technique becoming available to a wider community. Despite their mantra of “validity and reliability,” Speakman and Shackley erroneously equate these two concepts with the accuracy of an instrument's measurements. Additionally, they mischaracterise a self-contained test, conducted with specific parameters (i.e., “off-the-shelf” operation), as an endeavour to facilitate or endorse poor-quality data. Paradoxically, their disparagement of experimental internal consistency as “silliness” is incongruous with their own data. Furthermore, a discussion focused on handheld instruments is obfuscated by their inclusion of desktop instruments that are “portable” only in the sense of luggable to an electrical outlet in a laboratory context. Most troubling is that they envision themselves as the arbiters of science vs. “playing scientist.” Contrary to their claims, HHpXRF proliferation will improve reproducibility and archaeological results.",WOS:000313152800064,JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGICAL SCIENCE

As a result, researchers are looking for practical solutions, not only to enhance scientific collaborations, but also to acquire larger amounts of data, and to access specialized datasets. In many cases, the realities of data acquisition present a significant burden, therefore gaining access to public datasets allows for more robust analyses and broadly enriched data exploration. To answer this demand, the Montreal Neurological Institute has announced its commitment to Open Science, harnessing the power of making both clinical and research data available to the world (Owens 2016). As such, the LORIS and CBRAIN (Das 2015) platforms have been tasked with the technical challenges specific to the institutional-level implementation of open data sharing, including: 1) Comprehensive linking of multimodal data (phenotypic. clinical, neuroimaging, biobanking and genomics, etc.) 2) Secure database encryption, specifically designed for institutional and multi-project data sharing, ensuring subject confidentiality (using multi-tiered identifiers). 3) Querying capabilities with multiple levels of single study and institutional permissions, allowing public data sharing for all consented and de-identified subject data. 4) Configurable pipelines and flags to facilitate acquisition and analysis, as well as access to High Performance Computing clusters for rapid data processing and sharing of software tools. 5) Robust Workflows and Quality Control mechanisms ensuring transparency and consistency in best practices. 6) Long term storage (and web access) of data, reducing loss of institutional data assets. 7) Enhanced web-based visualization of imaging, genomics, and phenotypic data, allowing for real-time viewing and manipulation of data from anywhere in the world. 8) Numerous modules for data filtering, summary statistics, and personalized and configurable dashboards. Implementing the vision of Open Science at the Montreal Neurological Institute will be a concerted undertaking that seeks to facilitate data sharing for the global research community. Our goal is to utilize the years of experience in multi-site collaborative research infrastructure to implement the technical requirements to achieve this level of public data sharing in a practical, yet robust manner.",WOS:000391397200001,FRONTIERS IN NEUROINFORMATICS

These devices measure the gonioapparent color from the spectral relative reflectance factor and the L*a*b* values of the sample with different illumination and observation angles. These angles usually coincide with requirements marked in American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Deutsches Institut Fur Normung standards relating to the gonioapparent color, but the results of comparisons between these instruments are still inconclusive. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to compare several multiangle spectrophotometers at a reproducibility level according to ASTM E2214-08 guidelines. In particular, we compared two X-Rite multi-gonio spectrophotometers (MA98 and MA68II), a Datacolor multi-gonio spectrophotometer (FX10), and a BYK multi-gonio spectrophotometer (BYK-mac). These instruments share only five common measurement geometries: 45° × −30° (as 15°), 45° × −20° (as 25°), 45° × 0° (as 45°), 45° × 30° (as 75°), 45° × 65° (as 110°). Specific statistical studies were used for the reproducibility comparison, including a Hotelling test and a statistical intercomparison test to determine the confidence interval of the partial color differences ΔL*, Δa*, Δb*, and the total color difference ΔE*ab. This was conducted using a database collection of 88 metallic and pearlescent samples that were measured 20 times without the replacement of all the instruments. The final findings show that in most measurement geometries, the reproducibility differences between pairs of instruments are statistically significant, although in general, there is a better reproducibility level at certain common geometries for newer instruments (MA98 and BYK-mac). This means that these differences are due to systematic or bias errors (angle tolerances for each geometry, photometric scales, white standards, etc.), but not exclusively to random errors. However, neither of the statistical tests used is valid to discriminate and quantify the detected bias errors in this comparison between instruments. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Compared to CATA, RATA has the potential to improve sample description and discrimination, and might be more useful when only a small number of assessors are available. Before advocating its use with confidence, investigations on the method validity and reproducibility are necessary. Within this context, this short paper examined the reproducibility of results obtained by RATA within a test–retest paradigm, drawing on data from a case study involving sensory assessment of common defects in chocolate production. Criteria considered were within-assessors reproducibility, attribute stability, and configurational agreement between samples spaces obtained across replicated evaluations. The results showed that although within-assessors reproducibility was moderate, RATA exhibited a very good reproducibility at panel level, as indicated by the high configurational agreement between product maps obtained from individual replicates. The method showed a good reproducibility also at the level of individual attributes. Indications were obtained that the reproducibility of RATA with semi-trained subjects might be similar to that of a simple checklist, in spite of the addition of the intensity rating step. Overall, the work presented in this short paper supports the validity of RATA as a sensory profiling tool, and suggests that its application with semi-trained assessors may be particularly advantageous for industrial applications.",WOS:000374361600007,FOOD QUALITY AND PREFERENCE

To assess pace strategy change, in the first test participants chose the rest time interval (RTI) between sets (ranging from 30 to 60 s) and in the second test the maximum RTI values were either the RTI chosen in the first test (maximum RTI value), or less if desired.

For this, they may primarily rely on precision data for repeatability and reproducibility as reported by instrument manufacturers, who develop their instruments according to standardized measurement geometries defined in international standards. This paper reports on an investigation of the inter-instrument agreement between specular gloss meters which conform to universally adopted gloss standards. Six commercially available instruments, manufactured by three different companies, and twenty-five gloss artifacts, with specular gloss values ranging between 2 and 110 gloss units (60° geometry), were selected for use in the study. The repeatability and reproducibility of the instruments were assessed according to the criteria described in ASTM D523-14 and ISO 2813:2014, and to the specifications reported by the instrument manufacturers. Ray tracing simulations were performed by use of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function measurement data of two samples, and based on the standardized optical design of the specular gloss meter, in order to get a better insight on the expected tolerances of the gloss readings from a theoretical point of view. On average, the practical results indicate that both the repeatability and reproducibility values are higher than those specified in the recommendations and by the manufacturers. Ray tracing simulations confirm this finding. While specified repeatability and reproducibility thresholds are based on ideal standards, in practice, there are parameters that can lead to significant higher deviations. Care should therefore be taken when analyzing measurement results obtained from different instruments, and when defining tolerances for evaluation of gloss measurements.",WOS:000392511900001,JOURNAL OF COATINGS TECHNOLOGY AND RESEARCH

We hypothesized that an ideal collaborative relation can be developed from three elements: selections of appropriate topics of scientific projects, appropriate locations and opportunities for citizen-scientist interactions, and well-organized methodologies of the collaborations. To practice and develop this style of the crowd science, we have been organizing two annual workshops, the KYOTO Open Science Workshop in 2016 and 2017. The workshops were held at MTRL KYOTO outside universities, and were designed both for researchers and citizens. In the second workshop in 2017, we employed so-called ideathon technique to develop a survey project of alien slugs as an example. In the ideathon, participants proposed feasible plans to enhance the project, and researchers would not come up with such plans. Questionnaire results showed that 73% of participants had been motivated to the crowd science. We found that the above three fundamental elements induced citizens collaborative motivation to crowd science.

The methodology is illustrated using a collection of eight data sets which consist of the distortion product otoacoustic emission recordings collected from both ears of ten young Sprague-Dawley rats at different frequencies under eight different recording conditions. We formulate a model which extends the commonly used one-way random effects model (5) to account for an experimental setup that is more elaborated than the ones traditionally used in interlaboratory experiments. The fitted model is easily interpretable and furnishes as a by-product the frequencies at which the highest response level is achieved under the eight recording conditions.

Several studies have tested the reproducibility of such testing basing their conclusions mainly on intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values. The main goal of our research was to assess fully the reproducibility of isokinetic and isometric strength testing using both absolute (ICC) and relative reproducibility indices. A sample of 21 healthy recreational athletes without any history of shoulder injury was tested twice within a 1-week period using the TechnoGym REV900 isokinetic dynamometer. Testing was performed in a short range of motion (30°) at the angular velocities 30°/second and 60°/second in the concentric and isometric (at an angle of 30°) modes of contraction for both muscle groups. External rotators were tested in the eccentric mode of contraction at both testing velocities. Reproducibility analysis included ICC, repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), standard error of measurement (SEM), smallest real difference (SRD), and Bland and Altman analysis. Mean ICC ranged from 0.80 to 0.94; repeated measures ANOVA did not show any difference between the two test sessions ( p  > 0.05). In general, SEM% ranged from 6.0% to 9.9% and SRD% from 17% to 28%.

Maintaining a high degree of transparency in scientific reporting is essential not just for gaining trust and credibility within the scientific community but also for facilitating the development of new ideas. Sharing data and computer code associated with publications is becoming increasingly common, motivated partly in response to data deposition requirements from journals and mandates from funders. Despite this increase in transparency, it is still difficult to reproduce or build upon the findings of most scientific publications without access to a more complete workflow. Findings: Version control systems (VCS), which have long been used to maintain code repositories in the software industry, are now finding new applications in science. One such open source VCS, Git, provides a lightweight yet robust framework that is ideal for managing the full suite of research outputs such as datasets, statistical code, figures, lab notes, and manuscripts. For individual researchers, Git provides a powerful way to track and compare versions, retrace errors, explore new approaches in a structured manner, while maintaining a full audit trail. For larger collaborative efforts, Git and Git hosting services make it possible for everyone to work asynchronously and merge their contributions at any time, all the while maintaining a complete authorship trail. In this paper I provide an overview of Git along with use-cases that highlight how this tool can be leveraged to make science more reproducible and transparent, foster new collaborations, and support novel uses.",WOS:000215861200007,SOURCE CODE FOR BIOLOGY AND MEDICINE

Several optimization and scalability problems exist where the reproducibility of results remains guaranteed. Firstly, various data streams need to be coordinated to optimize the accuracy and processing of the results. Secondly, because of the high volume of streaming data and a series of processing steps to be performed on that data, demand for disk space may grow unacceptably high. Lastly, reproducibility in a decentralized scenario may be difficult to achieve because of data replication. This paper introduces and addresses these challenges which arise for optimizing the process of achieving reproducibility of results.","",""

Methods We used 3dMD Flex (3dMD, Atlanta, Ga) to obtain 60 stereophotogrammetric images from the same participant. Thirty images were obtained in 3 sessions on the same day, and the procedure was repeated 6 weeks later for 30 more images. The surface-base registration, the segmentation of the upper and lower lips, and the 3-dimensional deviation analysis were performed with Geomagic Control (3D Systems, Rock Hill, SC) software. The Shapiro-Wilk test, paired sample t test, Bland-Altman plots, and Wilcoxon signed rank test were used for statistical analysis at a significance level of P Results The deviations of the upper lip on the first images were between 0.16 and 1.39 mm. The mean total deviation was 0.25 ± 0.12 mm. The mean deviation of the lower lip was 0.34 ± 0.17 mm. The deviations were observed between −1.96 and 1.97 mm. When the mean positive ( P  = 0.633 and P  = 0.171, respectively) and the mean negative ( P  = 0.771 and P  = 0.842, respectively) deviations of the upper and lower lips were analyzed, there was no significant difference between the 2 time points.

In each case, measurements were performed three times by three measurers on the same specimen of three common cyprinid species (roach Rutilus rutilus (Linnaeus, 1758), bleak Alburnus alburnus (Linnaeus, 1758) and Prussian carp Carassius gibelio (Bloch, 1782)) collected from three closely-situated sites in the Lake Balaton catchment (Hungary) in 2014. TRA measurements were made on conserved specimens using a digital caliper, while TRU, GMB and GMS measurements were undertaken on digital images of the bodies and scales. In most cases, intra-measurer repeatability was similar. While all four methods were able to differentiate the source populations, significant differences were observed in their repeatability, reproducibility and subjectivity. GMB displayed highest overall repeatability and reproducibility and was least burdened by measurer effect. While GMS showed similar repeatability to GMB when fish scales had a characteristic shape, it showed significantly lower reproducability (compared with its repeatability) for each species than the other methods. TRU showed similar repeatability as the GMS. TRA was the least applicable method as measurements were obtained from the fish itself, resulting in poor repeatability and reproducibility. Although all four methods showed some degree of subjectivity, TRA was the only method where population-level detachment was entirely overwritten by measurer effect. Based on these results, we recommend a) avoidance of aggregating different measurer’s datasets when using TRA and GMS methods; and b) use of image-based methods for morphometric surveys. Automation of the morphometric workflow would also reduce any measurer effect and eliminate measurement and data-input errors.",WOS:000378212400058,PLOS ONE

Consequently, during the process of re-execution these parameters may change or become unavailable and finally they can prevent to reproduce the workflow. However in most cases the lack of the original parameters can be compensated by replacing, evaluating or simulating the value of the descriptors with some extra cost in order to make it reproducible.

What is known and Objective:  There is almost no published information about reliability of scales for causality assessment in hepatotoxicity at pharmacovigilance centres. The aim of this study was to compare two commonly used scales in cases of unexpected hepatotoxicity, in evaluating their accuracy and reproducibility at pharmacovigilance centres (in signal detection).

Methods:  Two scales [Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences or Rousel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (CIOMS/RUCAM) and NARANJO] were compared in 19 cases of unexpected hepatotoxicity reported during 2004–2009. Data of the cases (with initial clinical assessments) were collected by a network of medical specialists using a structured reporting form. Later, two independent observers assessed each case using both scales. The accuracy and reproducibility of the scales were analysed by Kappa weighted (Kw) test.

Results:  Both scales (CIOMS/RUCAM vs. NARANJO) showed moderate agreement with the initial clinical assessments (accuracy) for observer A (Kw: 0·56 vs. 0·60) and substantial agreement for observer B (Kw: 0·72 vs. 0·70), with high agreement between observers (Kw: 0·84 vs. 0·67). Both observers (A vs. B) found low agreement between scales (Kw: 0·21 vs. 0·50), with lower scores for the CIOMS/RUCAM scale in 11 and nine cases, respectively. For an early perception of unexpected serious reactions, the scale is more useful if it is not asked for ‘previous knowledge’ and if it gives higher causality score.

What is new and conclusion:  The CIOMS/RUCAM scale showed similar accuracy, but better reproducibility (agreement between observers) than the NARANJO scale, and therefore is recommended for use at pharmacovigilance centres. Fine-tuning of the CIOMS/RUCAM method could contribute to better detection of unexpected hepatotoxicity.",WOS:000301111400013,JOURNAL OF CLINICAL PHARMACY AND THERAPEUTICS

Of these patients, 25 were assessed between 2 and 7 months after surgery (THAearly), and another 25 were assessed between 7 and 12 months after surgery (THAlate). Reproducibility of the PASE questionnaire was evaluated by administering the questionnaire on 2 different occasions. Construct validity of the PASE questionnaire was assessed by comparing the physical activity level reported by patients with that objectively recorded by a body-mounted accelerometer. Reproducibility was investigated with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC [2,1]) for reliability and standard errors of measurement (SEM) for agreement. Validity was investigated with Pearson correlation coefficients ( r ).

Results The ICC (2,1) for the PASE total score was .77 (95% confidence interval [95% CI]=.63, .86); the SEM was 23.0% (95% CI=19.2, 28.7). Validity correlation for the PASE total score was .38 (95% CI=.12, .60). No significant differences were found between THAearly and THAlate groups for reliability, agreement, and validity outcomes.

Limitations Reproducibility of the PASE questionnaire may have been underestimated because the physical activity of patients was compared between 2 consecutive but different weeks. Reliability and validity analyses were underpowered.

Conclusions Further study with a larger sample size is necessary to obtain precise reliability and validity estimates. Nevertheless, inadequate agreement calls into question the PASE questionnaire's ability to assess the physical activity level of patients after THA surgery.",WOS:000347146400008,PHYSICAL THERAPY

The “Principles and Guidelines for Reporting Preclinical Research” (http://www.nih.gov/research-training/rigor-reproducibility/principles-guidelines-reporting-preclinical-research) that emerged from the workshop have since been endorsed by nearly 80 societies, journals, and associations.

Rigorous, objective peer review was widely acknowledged as the key to publication of high quality science. The expert, dedicated members of the JBC Editorial Board provide an invaluable service to the community of JBC authors and readers by ensuring the rigor, reproducibility, and transparency of research reported in the Journal. Over the past year, the JBC Associate Editors have been working to make sure that JBC reviewing editors, and ultimately our readers, have the information they need from authors for rigorous evaluation of the scientific content of JBC manuscripts. This effort has led to extensive revisions of our Instructions for Authors (http://www.jbc.org/site/misc/ifora.xhtml) for reporting experimental uncertainty, animal studies, biological materials, immunoblot data, and imaging results.

The JBC has identified three major gaps in overall data reporting. We expect that filling these gaps will have an immediate impact on improving transparency in our journal. These gaps, which will be readily recognized by much of the bioscience community, include the need for (i) more complete disclosure of experimental design and reporting of experimental uncertainty and reproducibility, (ii) improved statistical and graphical presentation of quantitative data, and (iii) revised guidelines for the presentation and quantitation of immuno (“Western”) blots.",WOS:000366614700002,JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY

Methods: Cross-sectional, prospective, single-center study that had 20 panoramic radiographs of the spine in lateral view, in a neutral standing position, analyzed blindly and randomly by three independent examiners in three different times. The parameters were pelvic incidence (PI), pelvic tilt (PT) and lumbar lordosis (LL). The statistical analysis was performed to measure the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) between the two measurement methods, in addition to measuring the intra and inter-evaluators reliability. Results: For reproducibility analysis, the intra-evaluators ICC using the application resulted in a Kappa (K) of 0.975 for the evaluation of pelvic incidence (PI) evaluation. For pelvic tilt (PT), the K value obtained was 0.981 and the K measured for lumbar lordosis (LL) analysis was 0.987. The inter-evaluators evaluation of reproducibility using the application resulted in a K value of 0.917 for PI, 0.930 for PT and 0.951 for LL. For the assessment of equivalency of methods, comparing the application to the standard method, with a goniometer and dermographic pencil, the K value found for PI was 0.873, for PV was 0.939 and for LL was 0.914. All values were significant (p<0.001) against the null hypothesis. Conclusion: This smartphone application is a valid and reliable instrument for measuring the angle involved in the sagittal balance of the spine. Furthermore, the results show that its applicability is not inferior to the manual method with goniometer and dermographic pencil.","",""

Methods To evaluate the repeatability, two additional measurements were performed by the first examiner. To assess reproducibility, this was later followed by a single reading by the second examiner. The following parameters were recorded and evaluated in this study; central corneal thickness (CCT), thinnest corneal thickness (TCT), mean total corneal power (TCP) in central (0–4 mm), mean posterior corneal power (PCP) in central (0.5–2 mm), anterior and posterior elevation (best fit sphere [BFS]) in central 8 mm anterior and posterior eccentricity ( ɛ 2 ) in central 8 mm. Repeatability and reproducibility for each corneal parameter was assessed using the Bland–Altman analysis. Results Each of the three groups was consisted of 20 subjects (totally 60 patients, 30 men and 30 women). The 95% LoA for repeatability was very small, indicating small discrepancies between measurements related to CCT. Acceptable repeatability was also achieved for the other parameters in each group. However, the 95% LoA for value TCP was larger in keratoconic eyes. The 95% LoA for reproducibility was also very small, and acceptable for all measured parameters in each group. In addition, the 95% LoA was larger for the measurement of CCT and TCT for postrefractive corneas.

Hypothesis The analysis and classification of these fractures will be better with CT scans than with X-rays. Material and Methods Four observers evaluated 39 X-ray and CT scan files twice in the span of six weeks; each evaluation entailed classifying the fractures and describing their main features. Cohen's Kappa coefficient for inter-rater agreement was calculated and analysed. Results The inter- and intra-observer reproducibility with CT scans was better with X-rays for most of the parameters evaluated. The modified Hawkins classification provided better reproducibility than the AO/AOT one. However, this classification system was not perfect, even after modifications and use of CT scans. Discussion CT scans are an essential tool for the analysis of all talar fractures. We modified the Hawkins classification (as modified by Canal and Kelly) to include a Type 0 (no displacement or less than 2 mm), include frontal body fractures that are displaced like neck fractures and take into account comminuted fractures and other trauma in the area.

DEPICT (Descriptive Elements of Pharmacist Intervention Characterization Tool) was created in response to the frequently reported issue of poor intervention description across studies assessing the impact of clinical pharmacy activities. The aim of this study was to create an improved version of DEPICT (i.e. DEPICT 2) to better characterize clinical pharmacy services in order to ensure consistent reporting, therefore enhancing reproducibility of interventions in practice.

Method
A qualitative approach through a thematic content analysis was performed to identify components of pharmacist interventions described in 269 randomized controlled trials. A preliminary version of DEPICT 2 was applied independently by two authors to a random sample of 85 of the 269 RCTs and reliability determined by the prevalence-adjusted bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) or the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). The final version of DEPICT 2 was compared against DEPICT 1.

Results
The final version of DEPICT 2 comprised 146 items and 11 domains. The inter-rater agreement analysis showed that DEPICT presented good to optimal reproducibility, with a mean PABAK value of 0.87 (95% CI 0.85–0.89) and a mean ICC value of 0.88 (95% CI 0.62–1.14). The mean difference between items checked in the two versions (DEPICT 2 – DEPICT 1) was 10.58 (95% CI 9.55–11.61), meaning that approximately 11 more components were identified in the new version of DEPICT.

Conclusions
DEPICT 2 is a reliable tool to characterize components of clinical pharmacy services, which should be used to ensure consistent reporting of interventions to allow their reproducibility in practice.",WOS:000358693200006,JOURNAL OF EVALUATION IN CLINICAL PRACTICE

Several studies have reported significant variability in their translation measurements with no analysis of data reproducibility. Purpose We sought to determine the intra- and interobserver reproducibility of the computer-assisted geometric midplanes and rotation matrix methods in the measurements of intervertebral translations at different motion ranges of cervical flexion-extension in asymptomatic subjects and disc-herniated patients. Study design A blind, repeated-measure design was applied to determine the reproducibility for intervertebral translation measurements. Methods A total of 608 videofluoroscopic image sequences from the different motion ranges of cervical flexion and extension in 38 asymptomatic subjects and 38 disc-herniated patients were digitized for further analysis. Results The intra- and interobserver reproducibility on measuring the sequential translations were in the acceptable range for geometric midplanes method (average intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs], 0.860 and 0.806; mean absolute difference [MAD] 0.19 and 0.33 mm) and rotation matrix method (average ICCs, 0.807 and 0.735; MAD, 0.35 and 0.42 mm). There was significantly better reproducibility on the measurements of intervertebral translation for the geometric midplanes method than those of rotation matrix method (p=.001−.040). The absolute mean differences of the translation measurements between two image protocols averaged 11.2% and 10.8% for the asymptomatic subjects and disc-herniated patients, respectively. Conclusions Based on these results, both methods demonstrated acceptable reproducibility on the intervertebral translation measurements. The geometric midplanes method involving an averaging effect on the placements of vertebral landmarks and closer to center of rotation might reduce the errors in translation estimations.

Either through experience or intuition the reader will already know that the answer is with difficulty or not at all. In this paper we attempt to quantify this difficulty by reproducing a previously published paper for different classes of users (ranging from users with little expertise to domain experts) and suggest ways in which the situation might be improved. Quantification is achieved by estimating the time required to reproduce each of the steps in the method described in the original paper and make them part of an explicit workflow that reproduces the original results. Reproducing the method took several months of effort, and required using new versions and new software that posed challenges to reconstructing and validating the results. The quantification leads to “reproducibility maps” that reveal that novice researchers would only be able to reproduce a few of the steps in the method, and that only expert researchers with advance knowledge of the domain would be able to reproduce the method in its entirety. The workflow itself is published as an online resource together with supporting software and data. The paper concludes with a brief discussion of the complexities of requiring reproducibility in terms of cost versus benefit, and a desiderata with our observations and guidelines for improving reproducibility. This has implications not only in reproducing the work of others from published papers, but reproducing work from one’s own laboratory.",WOS:000327652100032,PLOS ONE

However, it is never possible to exactly repeat or reproduce the tests that are used for evaluation. To overcome this limitation, a statistical evaluation procedure can generally be used. However, most of the statistical procedures use scalar values as input without the ability to handle vectors or time-histories. To overcome these limitations, two numerical/statistical methods for determining if the impact time-history response of a mechanical system is repeatable or reproducible are evaluated and elaborated upon. Such a system could be a vehicle, a biological human surrogate, an Anthropometric Test Device (ATD or dummy), etc. The responses could be sets of time-histories of accelerations, forces, moments, etc., of a component or of the system. The example system evaluated is the BioRID II rear impact dummy. The evaluation begins by transforming the sets of time-histories into sets of relative-shapes and magnitudes of those response time histories. The two statistical procedures use the t and T2-tests. One uses a statistical comparison between the average time history of a set (Representative Curve (RC)) and the individual time histories of that set or other sets. The other procedure uses a statistical comparison of sets of time histories. Language: en","",""

Abstract
The ever-expanding choice of ocular metrology and imaging equipment has driven research into the validity of their measurements. Consequently, studies of the agreement between two instruments or clinical tests have proliferated in the ophthalmic literature. It is important that researchers apply the appropriate statistical tests in agreement studies. Correlation coefficients are hazardous and should be avoided. The ‘limits of agreement’ method originally proposed by Altman and Bland in 1983 is the statistical procedure of choice. Its step-by-step use and practical considerations in relation to optometry and ophthalmology are detailed in addition to sample size considerations and statistical approaches to precision (repeatability or reproducibility) estimates.",WOS:000292529100002,OPHTHALMIC AND PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS

However, current research is focussing mainly on the analysis of centre of pressure excursion and lacks consensus on how to assess joint movement during postural control tasks. This study introduces a new signal processing technique to comprehensively quantify joint sway during standing and evaluates its reproducibility. Fifteen patients with non-specific low back pain and ten asymptomatic participants performed three repetitions of a 60-second standing task on foam surface. This procedure was repeated on a second day. Lumbar spine movement was recorded using an inertial measurement system. The signal was temporally divided into six sections. Two outcome variables (mean absolute sway and sways per second) were calculated for each section. The reproducibility of single and averaged measurements was quantified with linear mixed-effects models and the generalizability theory. A single measurement of ten seconds duration revealed reliability coefficients of .75 for mean absolute sway and .76 for sways per second. Averaging a measurement of 40 seconds duration on two different days revealed reliability coefficients higher than .90 for both outcome variables. The outcome variables’ reliability compares favourably to previously published results using different signal processing techniques or centre of pressure excursion. The introduced signal processing technique with two outcome variables to quantify joint sway during standing proved to be a highly reliable method. Since different populations, tasks or measurement tools could influence reproducibility, further investigation in other settings is still necessary. Nevertheless, the presented method has been shown to be highly promising.",WOS:000393927500019,JOURNAL OF BIOMECHANICS

Smaldino and Richard McElreath (in Source) in the Royal Society Open Science journal. In this publication, Smaldino and McElreath indicate that poor research design and evidence data analysis are frequent issues found in current publications, encouraging false-positive findings. The authors think the reason why poor methods persist are (i) from incentives that favour them or/and (ii) from something more than just misunderstanding, once perennial calls for improvement are taken. In fact, this is leading to the natural selection of bad science, according to the authors. In another critical point, Smaldino and McElreath also show evidence that once publication is a principal factor for career advancement; some normative methods of analysis have almost certainly been selected to further publication instead of discovery. The understanding of this “dynamic system” requires no conscious strategizing by scientists, according to the authors. In fact, in an environment in which one must publish, independent on the quality or the significance, to advance in the career and not perish, one does not care about false-positive findings (we can find exceptions, of course). They prove/provide evidence their point of view with empirical basis (you can check in the Source) and conclude that the improvement of the quality of research requires change at the institutional level. The authors are finally emphatic in pointing out that to improve the culture of science, a great/significant shift must be made away from correcting misunderstandings and towards rewarding understanding. So, (almost) all of us can fail in finding the best way for science.","",""

Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) screening and surveillance programmes use ultrasound imaging to measure the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the infrarenal aorta. The aim of this study was to examine potential observer bias and variability in ultrasound measurements.

Methods:
Studies were identified for review via a MEDLINE database search (1966–2009). References supplied in accessed papers were also checked for potential relevance. Consistent search terminology, and inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to ensure quality of data. Nine papers were available to review.

Results:
Variation in intraobserver repeatability and interobserver reproducibility was identified. Six studies reported intraobserver repeatability coefficients for AP aortic diameter measurements of 1·6–4·4 mm. These were below the 5-mm level regarded as acceptable by the UK and USA AAA screening programmes. Five studies had interobserver reproducibility below the level of 5 mm. Four studies, however, reported poor reproducibility (range from − 2 to + 5·2 to − 10·5 to + 10·4); these differences may have had a significant clinical impact on screening and surveillance.

Conclusion:
The studies used different methodologies with no standardized measurement techniques. Measurements were taken by observers from different medical disciplines of varying grade and levels of training. Standard training and formal quality assurance of ultrasound measurements are important components of an effective AAA screening programme. Copyright © 2011 British Journal of Surgery Society Ltd.

Recently, a new urodynamic method for the assessment of stress urinary incontinence called high definition urethral pressure profilometry (HD-UPP) has been introduced. This method combines a novel microtip catheter with advanced signal processing to enable spatial data location and the reconstruction of a pressure image inside the urethra. In order to assess the reproducibility of HD-UPP data, we statistically evaluate HD-UPP datasets and compare them to data from a double balloon air-charged system.

Materials and Methods
Both catheters are used on sedated female minipigs. Data from the microtip catheter are processed through a signal reconstruction algorithm, urodynamic features are extracted, and compared to the air-charged system. Reproducibility of HD-UPP data is assessed by statistically evaluating consecutive, intra-individual datasets.

Results
HD-UPP delivers results in agreement with previous comparisons of microtip and air-charged systems. The average deviation of two consecutive, intra-individual pressure images is very low at 7 cm H2O.

Conclusions
HD-UPP provides physicians with detailed information on the pressure distribution inside the urethra. Through comparison with an air-charged catheter, it is shown that HD-UPP delivers results in agreement with previous studies on the comparison of microtip and air-charged catheters. It provides excellent reproducibility, as the difference between sequentially measured profiles from the same minipig is significantly lower than the one between profiles from different minipigs.",WOS:000404361100008,NEUROUROLOGY AND URODYNAMICS

We propose instead to interpret openness as a dynamic and highly situated mode of valuing the research process and its outputs, which encompasses economic as well as scientific, cultural, political, ethical, and social considerations. This interpretation creates a critical space for moving beyond the economic definitions of value embedded in the contemporary biosciences landscape and Open Science policies, and examining the diversity of interests and commitments that affect research practices in the life sciences.

The second control method counteracts for distortions in the process state variables by corrective measures using advanced closed-loop or feedback control modes.

The elderly persons were distributed among 10previously trained CHWs. To assess the validity of the ROAG, a CHW and a dentist (considered as thegold standard) independently evaluated the same individual. The reproducibility of the ROAG was eval-uated by each of the CHWs examining 5–6 elderly individuals twice with a 7-day interval.Results: The sensitivity ranged from 0.17 for evaluation of saliva to 0.80 for voice. The speciﬁc rangedfrom 0.69 for teeth/dentures to 0.98 for saliva using mirror and the accuracy ranged from 0.92 for swal-low to 0.64 for mucosa. The intra-rater reproducibility of the ROAG was perfect for evaluation of voice,lips and swallow (j = 1.000).Conclusion: When used by trained CHWs, the ROAG is a tool with high sensitivity and speciﬁcity toassess voice, swallowing, tongue and teeth/dentures.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate the reproducibility of an organoleptic evaluation method using three levels of scores (0 = no odor, 1 = moderate odor, and 2 = strong odor) to increase reliability between researchers and clinicians. Methods: The evaluation was blindly conducted by two examiners previously calibrated by the Smell Identification Test and compliance in clinical trials. Statistical calculations were done with STATA ® software version 9.0. Results: The degree of agreement between examiners was 82.5%, with estimated Kappa (κ =0.69), with substantial agreement. Conclusion: The scale used in this study by organoleptic method was effective and reproducible but must be repeated and compared to other methods for better consistency of results.","",""

The reproducibility of the MEGA-PRESS (MEshcher-GArwood Point RESolved Spectroscopy) MR spectroscopy sequence for the measurement of gamma- aminobutyric acid (GABA) is addressed, focusing on optimizing the number of repetitions at two voxel locations in the human brain and associated possibilities in analysis tools.

Materials and Methods
Two 20-min MEGA-PRESS acquisitions were run (echo time = 68 ms, repetition time = 1800 ms, repetitions = 328): one from a 21 mL volume in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and one from a 22 mL volume in the left Broca's area in 21 healthy male volunteers (age 32 years ± 6[SD]). Subjects were scanned twice with identical protocols, 1 week apart. Data were acquired on a 3 Tesla GE Discovery 750 scanner using a 32-channel head coil. Spectroscopy data were partitioned into shorter epochs, numerically equivalent to scans of progressively increasing duration, and compared both within and between sessions. Three different analysis schemes were applied: (1) Vendor prototype preprocessor, with quantification by LCModel. (2) Pure Gannet pipeline. (3) Preprocessing with Gannet, and quantification with LCModel. The coefficient of variation (CV) were calculated as a measure of reproducibility.

Results
Increasing the number of repetitions showed improvements for within- and between-session reproducibility up to around 218 repetitions. (CV ranging from 4 to 14%). Gannet combined with LCModel approach proved the best method. (CV = 4–5%). Measurements from the ACC area had higher CVs than the Broca area. (CV = 6–14% versus 4–7%).

Conclusion
Measurement in the Broca area yields better reproducibility than the ACC. With appropriate acquisition times and preprocessing tools, measurements from the ACC area are also reliable.

Methods: Fixed and adaptive thresholding, fuzzy C-means, and fuzzy locally adaptive Bayesian methodology were considered for TV delineation. Double-baseline 18 F-FDG (17 lesions, 14 esophageal cancer patients) and 3'-deoxy-3'- 18 F-fluorothymidine ( 18 F-FLT) (12 lesions, 9 breast cancer patients) PET scans, acquired at a mean interval of 4 d and before any treatment, were used for reproducibility evaluation. The repeatability of each method was evaluated for the same datasets and compared with manual delineation. Results: A negligible variability of less than 5% was measured for all segmentation approaches in comparison to manual delineation (5%-35%). SUV max reproducibility levels were similar to others previously reported, with a mean percentage difference of 1.8% ± 16.7% and -0.9% ± 14.9% for the 18 F-FDG and 18 F-FLT lesions, respectively. The best TV, TGV, and TPV reproducibility limits ranged from -21% to 31 % and -30% to 37% for 18 -FDG and 18 F-FLT images, respectively, whereas the worst reproducibility limits ranged from -90% to 73% and -68% to 52%, respectively. Conclusion: The reproducibility of estimating TV, mean standardized uptake value, and derived TGV and TPV was found to vary among segmentation algorithms. Some differences between 18 F-FDG and 18 F-FLT scans were observed, mainly because of differences in overall image quality. The smaller reproducibility limits for volume-derived image indices were similar to those for SUV maX , suggesting that the use of appropriate delineation tools should allow the determination of tumor functional volumes in PET images in a repeatable and reproducible fashion.",WOS:000281559900012,JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE

However, the reproducibility of an indirect bonding setup by an orthodontist has yet to be described in the literature. Using cone-beam computed tomography and computer-assisted modeling software, we evaluated the consistency of orthodontists in placing orthodontic brackets at different times. Methods Five orthodontists with experience in indirect bonding were selected to place brackets on 10 different casts at 3 time periods (n = 30 per orthodontist). Each participant completed an initial indirect bonding setup on each cast; subsequent bracket placements were completed twice at monthly intervals for comparison with the initial setup. The casts were scanned using an iCAT cone-beam computed tomography scanner (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa) and imported into Geomagic Studio software (Geomagic, Research Triangle Park, NC) for superimposition and analysis. The scans for each time period were superimposed on the initial setup in the imaging software, and differences between bracket positions were calculated. For each superimposition, the measurements recorded were the greatest discrepancies between individual brackets as well as the mean discrepancies and standard deviations between all brackets on each cast. Results Single-factor and repeated-measure analysis of variance showed no statistically significant differences between time points of each orthodontist, or among the orthodontists for the parameters measured. The mean discrepancy was 0.1 mm for each 10-bracket indirect bonding setup. Conclusions Orthodontists are consistent in selecting bracket positions for an indirect bonding setup at various time periods.",WOS:000327141900017,AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ORTHODONTICS AND DENTOFACIAL ORTHOPEDICS

Fifty young men underwent the H-HJA, V-HJA, and PSLR on the right and left legs 3 times in a randomized order with a 4-week interval between trials under a controlled laboratory environment. Reproducibility was examined using coefficient of variation (CV) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC3,1) and their respective confidence limits. Regression and kappa correlation analyses were performed to examine the association of H-HJA and V-HJA with the PSLR test, and the 95% limits of agreement between H-HJA and V-HJA were calculated to check if there were differences in the raising scores. The results demonstrated acceptable reproducibility measures for the H-HJA (4.12% CV; 0.93 ICC), V-HJA (4.99% CV; 0.92 ICC), and PSLR (4.83% CV; 0.88 ICC). The H-HJA (R2 = 0.62) and V-HJA (R2 = 0.63) results were significantly associated with those of the PSLR. The 95% limits of agreement between the H-HJA and V-HJA reported systematic bias (+7.12 cm) and a wide 95% random error ( ±13.72 cm). This study concluded that the test-retest reproducibility of the H-HJA, V-HJA, and PSLR is acceptable and that the validity of H-HJA and V-HJA is moderate. Furthermore, the H-HJA cutoff scores should not be used for V-HJA for the detection of short hamstring muscles in young adults.",WOS:000308445500009,JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH

To develop a questionnaire as a screening tool for adverse reactions to foods in children and to assess the technical reproducibility by test-retest. Methods. Reproducibility of the questionnaire was performed by the literature review, preparing the preliminary questionnaire, peer review, pretest, and retest analysis. The study of the test-retest reproducibility was cross-sectional and descriptive. Kappa coefficient was used to study the reproducibility of the questionnaire. The sample consisted of 125 2–4 year-old children from 15 daycare centers in Recife, Brazil, and interviews with parents or caregivers were used to collect data. Results. From the total children, sixty-three were boys (50.4%), forty-six were two years old (36.8%), forty-seven were three years old (37.6%), and thirty-two were four years old (25.6%). Forty caregivers reported that their child had health problems with food. Most frequently reported offending foods were milk, peanuts, shrimp, and chocolate. Nine questions showed a good Kappa index (≥0,6). Conclusions. The questionnaire used needs to be resized and reshaped on the basis of the issues with good internal consistency and reproducibility. The use of a validated and reproducible questionnaire in the children represents an important contribution towards assessing an eventual rise in overt food allergy.","",""

We define code2brain (C2B) interfaces as maps in compilers and brains between meaning and naming syntax, which help to understand executable code. While working toward an Evolvix syntax for general-purpose programming that makes accurate modeling easy for biologists, we observed how names affect C2B quality. To protect learning and coding investments, C2B interfaces require long-term backward compatibility and semantic reproducibility (accurate reproduction of computational meaning from coder-brains to reader-brains by code alone). Semantic reproducibility is often assumed until confusing synonyms degrade modeling in biology to deciphering exercises. We highlight empirical naming priorities from diverse individuals and roles of names in different modes of computing to show how naming easily becomes impossibly difficult. We present the Evolvix BEST (Brief, Explicit, Summarizing, Technical) Names concept for reducing naming priority conflicts, test it on a real challenge by naming subfolders for the Project Organization Stabilizing Tool system, and provide naming questionnaires designed to facilitate C2B debugging by improving names used as keywords in a stabilizing programming language.

Since 2009, the University of Oklahoma (OU) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) have engaged in a series of exercises with the Namibian Ministry of Agriculture, Water, and Forestry to build the capacity to improve the water information available to local decision-makers. These activities have included the calibration and implementation of NASA and OU’s jointly developed Coupled Routing and Excess Storage (CREST) hydrological model as well as the Ensemble Framework for Flash Flood Forecasting (EF5). Hydrological model output is used to produce forecasts of river stage height, discharge, and soil moisture.To enable broad access to this suite of environmental decision support information, a website, the Namibia Flood Dashboard, hosted on the infrastructure of the Open Science Data Cloud, has been developed...",WOS:000409368200013,BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY

In chemical measurement ‘reproducibility’ is mostly taken to refer to an interlaboratory study, either a collaborative trial (that is, with a strictly defined analytical procedure) or a proficiency test (with no prescribed procedure). At first sight, we might expect the reproducibility standard deviation of the proficiency test to be the greater for the same determination: the various procedures used by the participants will each introduce an extra uncertainty related to their specific biases. No comprehensive study of this potential disparity has been undertaken hitherto. The issue is important because reproducibility standard deviation is closely related to standard uncertainty. Here a comparison is made between the trend of collaborative trial outcomes (standard deviation as a function of concentration) and individual values from the FAPAS proficiency testing scheme in the food analysis sector. Contrary to expectations, the general tendency is for proficiency tests to provide slightly smaller standard deviations than do collaborative trials at mass fractions of the analyte greater than 10−7, and slightly higher at lower concentrations. However, there is considerable variation around the median level of the ratio at all mass fractions.","",""

Geometrical corrections were performed prior to analysis, to enable multi-parametric analysis on the same ROI. Methods: Ten patients with biopsy-proven esophageal cancer underwent an MRI exam before, during and after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy. The scan protocol consisted of an anatomical T2w scan (TE/TR = 100/1938ms), a DWI scan (b = 0, 200, 800 s/mm2, voxel size 3.25x3.25mm) and a B0 map to monitor magnetic field distortions (dual echo, dual acquisition, TE1/TE2 = 4.6/9.2ms). DWI scans were obtained with a single shot echo-planar read-out (BW_phaseenc ∼ 30 Hz/pixel). Two acquisitions were performed with opposing phase-encoding gradient directions, which results in opposing geometrical distortions. Subsequently, both DWI scans were geometrically corrected using the B0 map, and ADC maps were calculated. For analysis of the inter-observer reproducibility, two clinicians delineated the tumor volume on the T2w image. The ROIs were transferred to the ADC map. Finally, the repeatability was determined by comparing the ADC within one ROI between the two DWI scans in an exam. The inter-observer reproducibility was determined by comparing the ADC values within the two ROIs. Results: The average geometrical distortion over all ROIs was 2.67mm (range: 0.02-17.66mm). The repeatability of geometrical corrected ADC maps was 10.0%, the inter-observer reproducibility 7.9%. Both percentages are 95%-confidence intervals (1.96x standard deviation of median ADC). Conclusion: Geometrical correction was required as considerable distortions were observed. Corrected ADC maps of esophageal cancer are associated with a modest repeatability error and inter-observer reproducibility error, which are in the same range compared to previous reports in other malignancies. In future, we will incorporate repeatability and reproducibility data in MRI-based (multi-parametric) treatment response models of esophageal cancer.","",""

Statistical standardisation and a repeatability and reproducibility analysis were performed on mouse perfusion signals with respect to differences in body temperature, the presence or absence of hair, the type of anaesthesia used for LDPI measurements and the position of the mouse body. Results. We found excellent correlations among measurements made by the same operator (i.e., repeatability) under the same experimental conditions and by two different operators (i.e., reproducibility). A Bland-Altman analysis showed the absence of bias in repeatability (p = 0.29) or reproducibility (p = 0.89). The limits of agreement for repeatability were –0.357 and –0.033, and for reproducibility, they were –0.270 and 0.238.

A high-quality search strategy is considered an essential component of systematic reviews but many do not contain reproducible search strategies. It is unclear if low reproducibility spans medical disciplines, is affected by librarian/search specialist involvement or has improved with increased awareness of reporting guidelines.
Objectives 
To examine the reporting of search strategies in systematic reviews published in Pediatrics, Surgery or Cardiology journals in 2012 and determine rates and predictors of including a reproducible search strategy.
Methods 
We identified all systematic reviews published in 2012 in the ten highest impact factor journals in Pediatrics, Surgery and Cardiology. Each search strategy was coded to indicate what elements were reported and whether the overall search was reproducible. Reporting and reproducibility rates were compared across disciplines and we measured the influence of librarian/search specialist involvement, discipline or endorsement of a reporting guideline on search reproducibility.
Results 
272 articles from 25 journals were included. Reporting of search elements ranged widely from 91% of articles naming search terms to 33% providing a full search strategy and 22% indicating the date the search was executed. Only 22% of articles provided at least one reproducible search strategy and 13% provided a reproducible strategy for all databases searched in the article. Librarians or search specialists were reported as involved in 17% of articles. There were strong disciplinary differences on the reporting of search elements. In the multivariable analysis, only discipline (Pediatrics) was a significant predictor of the inclusion of a reproducible search strategy.
Conclusions 
Despite recommendations to report full, reproducible search strategies, many articles still do not. In addition, authors often report a single strategy as covering all databases searched, further decreasing reproducibility. Further research is needed to determine how disciplinary culture may encourage reproducibility and the role that journal editors and peer reviewers could play.",WOS:000384167300035,PLOS ONE

Reproducibility of four cognitive tests in family dogs across testing sites and breeds,0,"A fundamental precept of the scientific method is reproducibility of methods and results, and there is growing concern over the failure to reproduce significant results. Family dogs have become a favoured species in comparative cognition research, but they may be subject to cognitive differences arising from genetic (breeding lines) or cultural differences (e.g. preferred training methods). Such variation is of concern as it affects the validity and generalisability of experimental results. Despite its importance, this problem has not been specifically addressed to date. Therefore, we aimed to test the influence of three factors on reproducibility: testing site (proximal environment), breed and sex (phenotype). The same experimenter tested cognitive performance by more than 200 dogs in four experiments. Additionally, dogs’ performance was tested in an obedience task administered by the owner. Breed of dog and testing site were found to influence the level of performance only mildly, and only in a means-end experiment and the obedience task. Our findings demonstrate that by applying the same test protocols on sufficiently large samples, the reported phenomena in these cognitive tests can be reproduced, but slight differences in performance levels can occur between different samples. Accordingly, we recommend the utilisation of well-described protocols supported by video examples of the whole experimental procedure. Findings should focus on the main outcome variables of the experiments, rather than speculating about the general importance of small or secondary performance outcomes which are more susceptible to random or local noise.",WOS:000412948000002,ANIMAL COGNITION
