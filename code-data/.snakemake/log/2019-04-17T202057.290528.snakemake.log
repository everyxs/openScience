rule dataTransformation:
    input: Open.csv, Reproduce.csv
    output: openRaw.graphml, reproduceRaw.graphml, duplicated_remove.csv, newdataCombined.csv
    jobid: 2

Waiting at most 30 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 18 of /home/jovyan/ReproducibilityDemo/code-data/Snakefile:
Missing files after 30 seconds:
openRaw.graphml
reproduceRaw.graphml
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job dataTransformation since they might be corrupted:
duplicated_remove.csv, newdataCombined.csv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
