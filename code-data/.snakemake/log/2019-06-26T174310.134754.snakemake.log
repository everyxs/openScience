Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
MissingOutputException in line 44 of /home/jovyan/ReproducibilityDemo/code-data/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
figures/TeamSizeHist_fem.pdf
figures/PredictedProbs_multiauthor_spline2.pdf
figures/PredictedProbs_multiauthor_spline2_FOS.pdf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Removing output files of failed job genderAnalysis since they might be corrupted:
figures/TimeHist.pdf, figures/TeamSizeHist.pdf, figures/TimeTrends_fem.pdf, figures/FoS_appearances.pdf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
