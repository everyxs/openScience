And yet there is not much clarity on how recognition operates, on the kind of effects which the operation we perform when recognizing bring about. The purpose of my article is to shed light on a specific (and overlooked) form of recognition, situated between the cognitive one (identification, as discussed in the analytical debate over identity criteria) and the normative one (respect and esteem, as defined by Charles Taylor and Axel Honneth), a form of recognition I will call ‘descriptive’, because its function is not so much to identify a person as to describe her features."

These South-African based Garveyites articulated a prophetic Garveyist Christianity that provided common ideological ground for Africans and diasporic blacks through leading black South African organizations like the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA), the African National Congress (ANC) and the Industrial and Commercial Workers Union (ICU). This study utilizes a 'homeland and diaspora' model that simultaneously offers an expansive framework for African history, redresses the relative neglect of Africa and Africans in African diaspora studies and demonstrates the impact of Garveyism on the country's interwar black freedom struggle."

Through widespread applications of graphical methods by scientists in the nineteenth century, sounds and living bodies became similarly legible through waveform representations: characterized by extensions into space, fluctuations over time, part-whole relations, and associated aesthetic variations. This knowledge was advanced by the German scientist Hermann von Helmholtz, whose work was central to the emerging fields of acoustics and electronic music in the United States by the early twentieth century. During a period of American history in which industrialization and urbanization engendered new patterns of encounter, audio-technical practitioners learned to distinguish individual sounds by aesthetic signifiers, like purity and deviation, that marked such social differences as race, class, and gender. I frame this history with a feminist theory of technological worlding, proposing that the “worlds of sound” made in audio-technical discourse are spaces of encounter and contestable realms of cultural politics."

Humanism centres on the autonomous adult self as sole source of knowledge production, and instils binaries that marginalise, divide and dichotomise the 'other' in age, race, ethnicity, ability and sexuality. Postcolonial theorising interrogates these power-producing binaries, but tends to retain the dominant western ontological binary between language and reality, thereby assuming that knowledge production is always mediated through the discursive and represented in human-made languages, keeping the material world at a distance. The key question is 'What is left out, forgotten or ignored by using the discursive apparatus of the social sciences only?'.#N#Using Karen Barad's reading of quantum physics I propose a radically different and positive philosophical orientation towards decolonisation and a 'post'colonial future through a juxtaposition of a humanist and a posthumanist analysis of a series of photos I 'made' of the Cecil Rhodes's statue before it was removed from the University of Cape Town's campus. The question what it means to decolonise a university is not only epistemological, but also ontological and can remain radically open when we view meaning making as discursive and material, thereby doing justice to the agency of the nonhuman other."

Aerial thermonuclear fission bomb tests, performed during the late 1950s, injected a massive amount of this isotope into the atmosphere, which exceeded the natural fallout signal. Since this bomb pulse, atmospheric 36 Cl deposition tends to return to natural fallout rate. The monitoring of this attenuation can provide a good opportunity to extend the use of this chro-nometer to shorter time spans. Venice's lagoon alimentation zone shows groundwaters with residence times distributed over last fifty years. This permits the estimation of a continuous 36 Cl deposition curve, free from latitudinal and seasonal variations of the signal. Three old groundwater samples, with residence times comprised in the range A900 to A8000 BP, allow the estimation of a mean natural deposition of 49 at m A2 s A1 and are in good agreement with 36 Cl fallout observed for the last 40,000 years by (Plummer et al., 1997). For the bomb pulse period, a fallout of 5300 at m A2 s A1 was calculated. This was followed by a strong attenuation period, taking place until the 1980s, during which the fallout reached values ranging between 167 and 354 at m A2 s A1. The attenuation reached then a plateau: it experienced a slower lowering until the actual deposition, with fallout values calculated between 124 and 252 at m A2 s A1. This persistence of high deposition rate was classically attributed to biological and atmo-spherical recycling processes or underestimation of the natural atmospheric production of the 36 Cl. Additional source of 36 Cl production has been envisaged through the activation of chlorine radicals from stratospherical CFCs, leading to a 36 Cl production rate comparable with that of Ar spallation from the first approximation. Lastly, the latitudinal factor of the attenuation of the fallout rate is discussed and the impact of the jet streams is proposed as an explanation for the discrepancies in the attenuation rate."

At present, there is less study on the 3D representation of micro-landform in comparison with large scale 3D modeling of terrain. Regarding the building of a simulation environment that reflects the real situation of the Loess Plateau, it's necessary to consider the features of micro-landform. This paper aims to explore the way of building 3D model of terrace in the Loess Plateau, which is a typical landscape in the region. According to the characteristics of terrace, level terrace, the most common type, is considered as a modeling object and a new method of feature based TIN (Triangular Irregular Network) modeling is put forward. Two key techniques regarding the method are terraces' feature extracting and the obtaining of object's elevation of points in each feature line to make TIN interpolation."

EUWB has effectively leveraged and significantly enhanced the scientific knowledge base in the advanced UWB-RT and has provided sophisticated new applications enabled by UWB and highly demanded in several European key industrial sectors such as home entertainment consumer electronics, automotive, public transportation, and heterogeneous cellular networks. It is anticipated that the efficient exploitation of cross-layer functionalities will fertilize the successful application of UWB technology. Within EUWB, major fields of this emerging challenge have been identified, such as the cognitive radio related Detect-And-Avoid (DAA) technology and the localization and tracking (LT) technology. An important aspect is to design an LT protocol. In this manuscript the authors will first illustrate the technical approach of EUWB, giving a brief overview of the project. Then, the authors will propose a novel LT protocol and application. This application is tailored to operate also with UWB devices that do not fully comply with the previously proposed LT schemes which need specific physical and medium access control layer functionalities."

However, the technique has been the subject of recent controversies, and its validity awaits new experimental evidence. This paper presents a new test based on the analysis of the dependence on water potential difference (ΔΨ) of stem diameter variation (AD) in walnut (Juglans regia L.). The correlation between ΔΨ and AD was established (1) on transpiring potted trees, (2) on dehydrating cut branches, (3) by perfusing the xylem of branch segments with mannitol and sucrose solutions, and (4) by pressurizing segments in a pressure sleeve. The ΔΨ was respectively assessed with a pressure chamber (1, 2), a freezing point osmometer (3) and an air pressure transducer (4). A single relationship was established between ΔΨ (ranging from 0 to -2 MPa) and AD for all the experiments. This shows that the measured changes of water potential were correlated to similar modifications of water content in the stems, irrespective of the technique used to induce these changes, and therefore validates the pressure chamber technique and confirms the occurrence of large negative pressures in the xylem of walnut branches."

Small molecule inhibitors able to induce the DFG-out state have received considerable attention in kinase drug discovery. Using a typical DFG-in inhibitor scaffold of Aurora A, a kinase involved in the regulation of cell division, we found that halogen and nitrile substituents directed at the N-terminally flanking residue Ala273 induced global conformational changes in the enzyme, leading to DFG-out inhibitors that are among the most potent Aurora A inhibitors reported to date. The data suggest an unprecedented mechanism of action, in which induced-dipole forces along the Ala273 side chain alter the charge distribution of the DFG backbone, allowing the DFG to unwind. As the ADFG sequence and three-dimensional structure is highly conserved, DFG-out inhibitors of other kinases may be designed by specifically targeting the flanking alanine residue with electric dipoles."

These are cholesterol transporters which facilitate the transport of host lipids into the mycobacterium allowing long term survival during chronic infection. Currently, there are no rapid and reliable tests for the detection of latent TB. Therefore, because there is a lack of reliable and efficient tests for the diagnosis of latent TB, we tested the hypothesis that mycobacterial infection can be detected using mce4 siRNA molecular beacons against mce4 mRNAs. Because our work showed that the mce4A gene of the mce4 operon conferred infectivity to host E. coli, a siRNA molecular beacon was designed against a region of the mce4A mRNA that is highly homologous in Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium smegmatis. This molecular beacon has a hairpin structure with a stem, 5 nucleotides on either end that are complementary to each other, and a loop which contains 20 nucleotides that are complementary to a region of the target mRNA. Conjugated to the 5’ and 3’ ends of the molecular beacon are the fluorophore TYE 665 and quencher Iowa Black RQ-SP. In the absence of the target mRNA the hairpin structure will predominate and fluorescence will be quenched while in the presence of the target mRNA fluorescence will be induced. Our study shows that the siRNA molecular beacon detects its target in M. smegmatis and in macrophages infected with M. smegmatis and offers a potential test for detection of mycobacterial infection."

To do so, they rely on small switch buffers. However, in case of congestion, data center switches may suffer from throughput collapse for short TCP flows as well as temporary starvation for long TCP flows. In this paper, we introduce a lightweight hash-based algorithm called HCF (Hashed Credits Fair) to solve these problems at the switch level while being transparent to the end users. We show that it can be readily implemented in data center switches with O(1) complexity and negligible overhead. We illustrate using simulations how HCF mitigates the throughput collapse of short flows. We also show how HCF reduces unfairness and starvation for long-lived TCP flows as well as for short TCP flows, yet maximizes the utilization on the congested link. Last, HCF also prevents packet reordering."

This framework serves as a basis for future research in designing and implementing traffic monitoring applications. A two-layer network architecture is established for traffic information acquisition in the context of a WSN environment. In addition, a user-customizable data-centric routing scheme is proposed for traffic information delivery, in which multiple routing-related information is considered for decision-making to meet different user requirements.

We propose a method for hypermotor seizure detection based on accelerometers attached to the extremities. From the acceleration signals, multiple temporal, frequency, and wavelet-based features are extracted. After determining the features with the highest discriminative power, we classify movement events in epileptic and nonepileptic movements. This classification is only based on a nonparametric estimate of the probability density function of normal movements. Such approach allows us to build patient-specific models to classify movement data without the need for seizure data that are rarely available. If, in the test phase, the probability of a data point (event) is lower than a threshold, this event is considered to be an epileptic seizure; otherwise, it is considered as a normal nocturnal movement event. The mean performance over seven patients gives a sensitivity of 95.24% and a positive predictive value of 60.04%. However, there is a noticeable interpatient difference."

In this study, we generated a series of time-varying vocal tract shapes in simulating vowel-vowel (VV) sequence by the 3D articulatory model and analyzed their acoustic characteristics using the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method. Area functions (AF) showed that the vocal tract shapes vary smoothly frame by frame, while the transfer functions (TF) transit continuously from vowel to vowel for the first four formants. Acoustic roles of the piriform fossae were also examined. The piriform fossa generated two spectral dips around 4 kHz in transfer function. Pressure distribution patterns at first four formant frequencies for vowel /a/ were examined, which are consistent with previous studies. Experimental results showed that our physiological model can describe the details of the vocal tract."

The provided model is based on using step and slope oven configurations and making a quantitative comparison with the recent results obtained by using open-top oven scheme. It is found that in the slope oven scheme the SHG power is enhanced by 190% at a fundamental power of 50 W, indicating the significance of the represented model. Eventually, the merit of the proposed slope oven indicated through saturation control in the generation of high-power SH radiation."

Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a diet containing 2% conjugated linoleic acid for 1, 3, 6, and 12 weeks. In rats fed 2% conjugated linoleic acid, the weight of perirenal white adipose tissue was comparable with that of rats fed a conjugated linoleic acid-free diet. For fatty acid composition of perirenal white adipose tissue, both 16:1/16:0 and 18:1/18:0 ratios were significantly lower in the conjugated linoleic acid-fed group than the control group. Although there was no remarkable difference in serum triglyceride, total cholesterol, and phospholipid levels between dietary groups, serum leptin level was significantly lower than the control group, and lipid content in the perirenal white adipose tissue exerted a tendency toward low compared to the control value at 1-week feeding. On the other hand, leptin level in perirenal white adipose tissue was significantly lower in the conjugated linoleic acid-fed group than the control group at 12-week feeding. In conclusion, these observations suggest dietary conjugated linoleic acid is an acute reducer of serum leptin level. This may afford an explanation of the mechanism of anti-obesity effect in conjugated linoleic acid."

In the second part of the article I turn to a critical evaluation of the notion in connection with feminist politics. While I acknowledge the strengths of this concept in characterizing contemporary laboring practices, I nonetheless want to expose its shortcomings in advancing feminist politics. I contend that in order to imagine effective political responses to the problems currently facing us, feminist politics needs theoretical distinctions within the category of affective labor that allow us to advance a political and ethical problematization of our current forms of work."

It is primarily caused by a sudden increase in the number of vehicles in a relatively small number of roads and intersections, while other roads have the capacity to accommodate more traffic. In such situations, distributing traffic to roads in a balanced way could alleviate congestion. With the help of modern technology such as Internet of Things (IoT) and simulation, road users can be encouraged to choose their route on-the-fly, by providing necessary information such as projected travel time on the next leg. In extreme situations, traffic on some critical roads could be adaptively reduced by even introducing levy. A simple solution like providing road traffic information, benefits and penalties, etc., ahead in each intersection would allow travellers to make cognizant choices and therefore could lead to a better, more efficient traffic distribution.   To implement the proposed system, simulation and IoT must be brought together by a suitable communication middleware system so that they can work in synchrony. Implementing an actual IoT infrastructure and then testing the cause and effects of traffic congestion with the system in-place is a daunting task. Simulation would help us to test and validate the IoT system for functionality, performance, and scalability. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for integrating IoT and simulation using a message-oriented middleware in the context of an adaptive traffic regulation system and then demonstrate the framework with the help of a prototype implementation."

In practice, PKI-based solutions are introduced to solve security of grid computing. Because of limited computation power and limited memory spaces, it is difficult for wireless grid computing to gain secure solution in collaboration environment. The trusted computing (TC) technologies are introduced to offer great potential to improve this situation. In this paper, with treated trusted platform module (TPM) as a tamper-resistance module, a TC-enabled architecture is proposed to improve wireless grid security. Especially authorization protection is discussed to demonstrate how to gain enhanced and distributed security in grid environment"

Successful oral litholytic and other non-operative therapies of gallstones require exact determination of the stone components. Since computed tomography (CT) provides highly sensitive measurement of density, we performed a study to evaluate whether CT measurement of stone density allows a prediction of the composition of radiolucent gallstones.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Twenty-eight patients presenting with 29 radiolucent gallbladder (n= 17) or common bile duct stones (n=12) were included. Prior to operative or endo-scopic therapy the attenuation values (Hounsfield Units, HU) were assessed in vivo by CT under standardized conditions (Somatom II, 125 KV, 130 mAs). After surgical or endoscopic stone removal the concrements were dehydrated, homogenized and then analysed by infra-red spectroscopy. The previously measured Hounsfield units were not known to the investigator.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Eighteen cholesterol and 11 pigment stones could be identified. The attenuation values (Hounsfield units) of cholesterol stones amounting to 28–98 HU (48.7 pM 4.4 HU) differed significantly (P < 0.001) from pigment stones (90–120 HU/105.5 pM 2.8 HU). We conclude that computed tomography provides exact discrimination between cholesterol and non-cholesterol stones in vivo. Since only cholesterol stones can be dissolved by cheno- and ursodeoxycholic acid we recommend measurement of the radiodensity of gallstones by CT prior to any litholytic therapy.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Furthermore the prediction of the stone composition facilitates the decision on extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy and the selection of specific solvents for contact lysis via a nasobiliary probe.,"

The major components of the bakkenolide fraction are bakkenolide-D, bakkenolide-B, bakkenolide-IIIa and bakkenolide-IVa, which account for 60.04% of the total. The rats were treated with 40 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg or 5 mg/kg BAPT, and 0.942 mg/kg loratadine and 0.5% gum tragacanth were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The frequency of nose rubbing and sneezing was observed, the number of eosinophils infiltrating into the nasal tissue was counted, and serum levels of IL-4 and histamine were determined by ELISA. The results showed that BAPT had a beneficial effect on allergic rhinitis in ovalbumin-sensitized Wistar rats, which was evidenced by a significant decrease in the frequency of sneezing, the number of eosinophils infiltrating into the nasal tissue, and the serum levels of IL-4 and histamine. BAPT may therefore be a potential antiallergic drug. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

In the present study, we sought to determine the longitudinal course of alpha-Gal specific AB titers of all isotypes over 8 weeks among healthy adult subjects. Furthermore, we hypothesized that inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients display increased anti-Gal titers.  Materials and methods  We drew serum from healthy probands ( n  = 20) weekly for 8 weeks and obtained plasma samples of from patients suffering from Crohn's disease ( n  = 20) and ulcerative colitis ( n  = 20). We measured anti-Gal ABs of all isotypes and total immunoglobulin (Ig) content using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay technique. For statistical evaluation of the longitudinal titers, we calculated confidence intervals for the slopes of a random intercept model, comparing variances between and within the probands. For group comparisons, we performed paired student  t -tests and Pearson correlations.  Results  Alpha-Gal specific IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgA titers remained unvaried within a narrow range upon longitudinal observation. Most probands did not display alpha-Gal specific IgE ABs. Crohn's disease patients showed highly increased alpha-Gal-specific IgA titers compared with control subjects ( P    Conclusion  Apart from IgE, alpha-Gal-specific ABs of all isotypes remained constant over longer time periods in healthy subjects. Thus, significant titer changes actually represent increased antigen exposure and a specific anti-alpha-Gal response. Crohn's disease patients display increased anti-Gal IgA titers compared with healthy controls, which reflects a chronically impaired mucosal gut barrier in this patient cohort."

Since then, research focusing on anticancer oncolytic virotherapy has rapidly evolved. Today, oncolytic viral vectors have been engineered to stimulate and manipulate the host immune system, selectively targeting tumor tissues while sparing non-neoplastic cells. Glioblastoma multiforme, the most common adult primary brain tumor, has a disasterous history. It is one of the most deadly cancers known to humankind. Over the last century our understanding of this disease has grown exponentially. However, the median survival of patients suffering from this disease has only been extended by a few months. Even with the best, most aggressive modern therapeutic approaches available, malignant gliomas are still virtually 100% fatal. Motivated by the despera..."

Grade 1 recommendations are strong and indicate that the benefits do, or do not, outweigh risks, burden, and costs. Grade 2 suggestions are weaker as there is uncertainty regarding the benefits, risks and costs such that individual patients' values may lead to different choices (for a full understanding of the grading see the 'Grades of Recommendation for Antithrombotic Agents' chapter by Guyatt et al, CHEST 2008; 133[suppl]:123S-131S). Among the key recommendations are the following: for all patients presenting with non-ST-segment elevation (NSTE) acute coronary syndrome (ACS), without a clear allergy to aspirin, we recommend immediate aspirin (162 to 325 mg po) and then daily oral aspirin (75 to 100 mg) [Grade 1A]. For NSTE ACS patients who are at at least moderate risk for an ischemic event and who will undergo an early invasive management strategy, we recommend 'upstream' treatment either with clopidogrel (300 mg po bolus, followed by 75 mg/d) or a small-molecule IV glycoprotein (GP) IIb/IIIa inhibitor (eptifibatide or tirofiban) [Grade 1A]. For NSTE ACS patients who are at least moderate risk for an ischemic event and for whom an early conservative or a delayed invasive strategy of management is to be used, we recommend 'upstream' treatment with clopidogrel (300 mg oral bolus, followed by 75 mg/d) [Grade 1A]. For NSTE ACS patients who undergo PCI, we recommend treatment with both clopidogrel and an IV GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor (Grade 1A). We recommend a loading dose of 600 mg of clopidogrel given at least 2 h prior to planned PCI followed by 75 mg/d (Grade 1B). For all patients presenting with NSTE ACS, we recommend anticoagulation with UFH or LMWH or bivalirudin or fondaparinux over no anticoagulation (Grade 1A). For NSTE ACS patients who will undergo an early invasive strategy of management, we recommend UFH (with a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor) over either LMWH or fondaparinux (Grade 1B). For NSTE ACS patients in whom an early conservative or a delayed invasive strategy of management is to be used, we recommend fondaparinux over enoxaparin (Grade 1A) and LMWH over UFH (Grade 1B). We recommend continuing LMWH during PCI treatment of patients with NSTE ACS when it has been started as the 'upstream' anticoagulant (Grade 1B). In low- to moderate-risk patients with NSTE ACS undergoing PCI, we recommend either bivalirudin with provisional ('bail-out') GP IIb/IIIa inhibitors or UFH plus a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor over alternative antithrombotic regimens (Grade 1B)."

The energy generated in the pyrolysis reaction is included in the enthalpy variation. The transformation tensor was calculated using the weight loss curve and the roasting tensor described all changes, dehydration, glass transition, sugar degradation and chemical and biochemical reactions. The energy balances are described in enthalpy and entropy variations. In short, the SAFES technique works to describe this operation, is useful to determine and predict all changes in the food matter and permits us to determine the behaviors involved in this operation."

are vital for cellular functions and eukaryotic development because of their essential role as membrane constituents. Sterol biosynthetic intermediates (SBIs) represent a potential reservoir of signaling molecules in mammals and fungi, but little is known about their functions in plants. SBIs are derived from the sterol C4-demethylation enzyme complex that is tethered to the membrane by Ergosterol biosynthetic protein28 (ERG28). Here, using nonlethal loss-of-function strategies focused on Arabidopsis thaliana ERG28, we found that the previously undetected SBI 4-carboxy-4-methyl-24-methylenecycloartanol (CMMC) inhibits polar auxin transport (PAT), a key mechanism by which the phytohormone auxin regulates several aspects of plant growth, including development and responses to environmental factors. The induced accumulation of CMMC in Arabidopsis erg28 plants was associated with diagnostic hallmarks of altered PAT, including the differentiation of pin-like inflorescence, loss of apical dominance, leaf fusion, and reduced root growth. PAT inhibition by CMMC occurs in a brassinosteroid-independent manner. The data presented show that ERG28 is required for PAT in plants. Furthermore, it is accumulation of an atypical SBI that may act to negatively regulate PAT in plants. Hence, the sterol pathway offers further prospects for mining new target molecules that could regulate plant development."

This ability relies on the possibility of integrating different features of sensory stimuli with the spatio-temporal context in which they occur. While recent studies now suggest that somatosensory information is already processed by the hippocampus, the basic mechanisms still remain unexplored. Here, we used electrical stimulation of the paws, the whisker pad or the medial lemniscus to probe the somatosensory pathway to the hippocampus in the anaesthetized rat, and multisite electrodes, in combination with tetrode and intracellular recordings, to look at the properties of somatosensory hippocampal responses. We found that peripheral and lemniscal stimulation elicited small local field potential responses in the dorsal hippocampus about 35–40 ms post-stimulus. Current source density analysis established the local nature of these responses, revealing associated synaptic sinks that were consistently confined to the molecular layer (ML) of the dentate gyrus (DG), with less regular activation of the CA1 stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM). A delayed (40–45 ms), potentially active, current source that outlasted the SLM sink was present in about 50% cases around the CA1 pyramidal cell layer. Somatosensory stimulation resulted in multi-unit firing increases in the majority of DG responses (79%), whereas multi-unit firing suppression was observed in the majority of CA1 responses (62%). Tetrode and intracellular recordings of individual cells confirmed different firing modulation in the DG and the CA1 region, and verified the active nature of both the early ML sink and delayed somatic CA1 source. Hippocampal responses to somatosensory stimuli were dependent on fluctuations in the strength and composition of synaptic inputs due to changes of the ongoing local (hippocampal) and distant (cortical) state. We conclude that somatosensory signals reach the hippocampus mainly from layer II entorhinal cortex to directly discharge DG granule cells, while a different predominantly inhibitory process takes place in CA1, further controlling the hippocampal output. Therefore, our data reveal a distinct organization of somatosensory-related extra-hippocampal inputs converging onto DG and CA1."

One way to make dying decisions more rational is to write out a living will or advance directives to help doctors understand a patients’ intentions with regard to decisions about dying should they become unable to articulate that intention at some later, critical, life-or-death situation. Living wills and advance directives can therefore reduce the chances of mercy killing or euthanasia, especially in the context of a developing country, especially when lif..."

Concerns exist about the potential for adverse reproductive health effects among vaccine recipients. This retrospective cohort evaluated birth defects, in relation to maternal anthrax vaccination, among all infants born to US military service women between 1998 and 2004. Department of Defense databases defined maternal vaccination and infant diagnoses; multivariable regression models described potential associations between anthrax vaccination and birth defects in liveborn infants. Among 115,169 infants born to military women during this period, 37,140 were born to women ever vaccinated against anthrax, and 3,465 were born to women vaccinated in the first trimester of pregnancy. Birth defects were slightly more common in first trimester-exposed infants (odds ratio = 1.18, 95% confidence interval: 0.997, 1.41) when compared with infants of women vaccinated outside of the first trimester, but this association was statistically significant only when alternative referent groups were used. Although the small observed association may be unlikely to represent a causal relation between vaccination in early pregnancy and birth defects, this information should be considered when making decisions about administering anthrax vaccine to pregnant women."

Pharmaceutical strategies in the treatment of obesity include drugs that regulate food intake, thermo genesis, fat absorption, and fat metabolism. Fenproporex is the second most commonly consumed amphetamine-based anorectic worldwide; this drug is rapidly converted  in vivo  into amphetamine. Studies suggest that amphetamine induces neurotoxicity through generation of free radicals and mitochondrial apoptotic pathway by cytochrome  c  release, accompanied by a decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondria are intracellular organelles that play a crucial role in ATP production. Thus, in the present study we evaluated the activities of some enzymes of Krebs cycle, mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes and creatine kinase in the brain of young rats submitted to acute and chronic administration of fenproporex. In the acute administration, the animals received a single injection of fenproporex (6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg/kg i.p.) or tween. In the chronic administration, the animals received a single injection daily for 14 days of fenproporex (6.25, 12.5 or 25 mg/Kg i.p.). Two hours after the last injection, the rats were sacrificed by decapitation and the brain was removed for evaluation of biochemical parameters. Our results showed that the activities of citrate synthase, malate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase were increased by acute and chronic administration of fenproporex. Complexes I, II, II–III and IV and creatine kinase activities were also increased after acute and chronic administration of the drug. Our results are consistent with others reports that showed that some psychostimulant drugs increased brain energy metabolism in young rats."

The influences of the geometrical property and modulate frequency of trapping potential on soliton behaviour are discussed. When the trap potential has a very small trap aspect ratio or oscillates with a high frequency, the matter wave preserves its shape nearly like a soliton train in propagation, while the breathing behaviour, which displays the periodic collapse and revival of the matter wave, is found for a relatively large aspect ratio or slow varying potential. Meanwhile mass centre of the matter wave translates and/or oscillates for different trap aspect ratio and trap frequencies."

The vehicles are often equipped with sensors measuring temperature, conductivity, chlorophyll a fluorescence (Chl a), colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) fluorescence, phycoerithrin (PE) fluorescence and spectral volume scattering function at 117 degrees, providing users with high resolution, real time data. However, calibration of these instruments can be problematic. Most in situ calibrations are performed by deploying complementary instrument packages or water samplers in the proximity of the glider. Laboratory calibrations of the mounted sensors are difficult due to the placement of the instruments within the body of the vehicle. For the laboratory calibrations of the Slocum glider instruments we developed a small calibration chamber where we can perform precise calibrations of the optical instruments aboard our glider, as well as sensors from other deployment platforms. These procedures enable us to obtain pre- and post-deployment calibrations for optical fluorescence instruments, which may differ due to the biofouling and other physical damage that can occur during long-term glider deployments.

Comparisons between so called 'decriminalized' and prohibitionist states show decriminalization has not led to higher rates of current cannabis use. Under prohibition significant numbers of Western Australian citizens receive a criminal record for no more serious offence than the possession of a small amount of cannabis for personal use. Recent research has shown that such a conviction can have a real and detrimental impact on people's lives, reinforces disrespect for the cannabis laws, but appears not to deter cannabis use among those so convicted. This paper suggests that it is now beyond reasonable doubt that applying criminal sanctions for minor cannabis offences is not in the best interests of the community and recommends an alternative."

It has been implemented on a ridge gap resonator for 220-325 GHz. Carbon nanotubes based structures offer a rapid and low-cost turnover for prototyping. Measurements comparing two carbon nanotubes-based structures to a previously made Si structure and simulations are presented. From these measurements the unloaded Q-value and the loss/mm have been calculated and shows a loss of 0.079 dB/mm and 0.051 dB/mm for the lower frequency range respectively the higher frequency range, indicating that carbon nanotubes can be used for fast and low-cost prototyping of high-frequency devices."

Data from this original study were compared to a recent survey in order to determine if any changes in fish species composition had occurred during the approximately 30 year time period. A comparison of similarity for 44 collections showed low similarity between the two surveys for a large percentage of sites visited (86% for Jaccard's Similarity and 62% for Morisita Similarity). Sites with low similarity between survey dates were typically associated with impoundments. Most species missing in the recent survey include species considered sensitive, such as cyprinids and percids. Species that have increased since 1968 include centrarchids, a group typically tolerant of impoundment and environmental change. Virtually all fish species composition differences indicate a less pristine fish assemblage in the more contemporary survey, suggestin..."

However, there are drawbacks when it comes, for example, to time-resolved in situ measurements of wet-chemical synthetic reactions or when X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra are used for characterizing atoms that occupy different sites in a nanoparticle. In this paper, we report results of test experiments using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) for obtaining high-resolution spectra that allow in principle site- and/or valency-specific XANES measurements. For a detailed analysis of wet-chemical reactions, a microreactor system is used in which time resolution is obtained by spatial resolution, i.e., by measuring spectra at various points along the microreactor. This system provides significantly better resolution (in the order of milliseconds) compared to conventional techniques."

diagnosis of chronic exertional compartment syndrome (CECS) is commonly delayed due to the poor use of terminology by athletes, and many clinicians, that virtually any pain in the leg is ‘shin splints’. We will be able to provide our patients with a better serviceif we can target a more specific diagnosis with earlier and focused treatment. Therefore, when the history and presentation are most consistent with a stress fracture, radiographs and possibly an MRI or a bone scan should be obtained. If the pain is posterior and related to blood flow, venous or arterial Doppler studies or magnetic resonance angiography should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis of a blood clot or popliteal artery syndrome. Finally, when the history includes increasing pain with exertion with associated resolution with rest, the working diagnosis of CECS should be confirmed with intracompartmental pressure testing. Although alternative techniques using infrared sensors have been proposed,1 most experts agree that intracompartmental pressure testing is the gold standard.#N##N#Key questions, however, remain regarding the specific protocol a clinician should undergo when performing intracompartmental pressure testing. Should both legs be tested? Should the isolated, most symptomatic compartment or all four compartments be routinely tested? Are resting, immediate postexertion and delayed postexertion tests required for adequate testing?#N##N#Classic use of intracompartmental pressure measurements was established for the diagnosis of acute and not CECSs. In general, the clinical presentation for an acute compartment syndrome is more obvious with exquisite, unrelenting pain associated with a palpably tense compartment. In these cases, it is reasonable to test only the suspicious compartment. Indeed, it is within the standard of care to proceed with a fascial release in the acute setting even without confirming elevated pressures with an intracompartmental pressure measurement. For CECS, the standard of care is to confirm the diagnosis …"

That's what we would look like if each of our body parts were sized proportionally to the brain area that processes their sensory inputs. Each of our body parts is represented in the somatosensory cortex on a map (called the somatotopic map), which expands the representation of the more sensitive body parts. Sensory inputs travel from touch receptors in the skin to neurons in the appropriate sectors of the somatosensory cortex.#R##N##R##N#As much as neuroscientists know about these neural projections for touch, surprisingly little is understood about the neural correlates of conscious tactile perception. In a new study, Felix Blankenburg, Jon Driver, and their colleagues turn to a classic somatosensory illusion—called the cutaneous rabbit—that is perfectly suited to decoupling real and illusory touch. In the illusion, a rapid succession of taps is delivered first to the wrist and then to the elbow, which creates the sensation of intervening taps hopping up the arm (hence the illusion's name), even when no physical stimulus is applied at intervening sites on the arm.#R##N##R##N#Blankenburg et al. took advantage of this somatosensory illusion to investigate which brain regions play a role in illusory tactile perceptions. Previous studies had implicated the somatosensory cortex in the rabbit illusion, but did not directly test this possibility. To do this, the authors used state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging technology (called 3T fMRI) to scan the brains of people experiencing the illusion. With the enhanced image quality and resolution of this scanner (deriving from the stronger magnetic field plus a specially customized imaging sequence), the authors show that the same brain sector is activated whether the tactile sensation is illusory or real.#R##N##R##N#To identify brain-related activity associated with real and illusory perceptions, the researchers taped three electrodes to the inner side of participants' left forearms, one just above the wrist, the others spaced equidistantly toward the elbow. Electrical stimulation could be applied to these points (P1, P2, and P3) while participants lay in the scanner. For the genuine rabbit experience, each point received three pulses in P1-P2-P3 succession. For the illusion, six pulses were applied to P1 (the last three substituting for pulses at the intervening P2 site), followed by three pulses to P3; this resulted in the same P1-P2-P3 tactile experience as when P2 was actually stimulated. For the control condition, P1 received three pulses, followed by three pulses to P3 and then to P1 (a sequence that does not produce the illusion of being stimulated at P2). After each sequence, participants indicated whether or not they felt any stimulation at P2.#R##N##R##N#Blankenburg et al. looked for brain regions that showed similar increases in neuronal activity during the real and illusory rabbit conditions, compared with the controls, and also looked for any regions that differed between the two conditions. Only one area showed similar and heightened activity during the genuine and illusory rabbit sequences, compared with controls: the precentral gyrus, where the first cortical area to represent touch is located (called S1). The increased activity within S1 fell in the exact sector corresponding to the P2 position on the forearm (even though it was not actually stimulated during the illusion). The researchers confirmed this correspondence by separate somatotopic mapping of the skin sites' representation in each participant's brain when each site was stimulated (with no illusion produced).#R##N##R##N#Altogether, these results suggest that the illusion of being touched at a particular place on the body engages exactly the same sector of the brain that would respond if that body part had actually been touched. This connection between conscious perception and somatotopic cortical processing for illusory percepts may shed light on conditions such as phantom limb pain following amputation, and other perceptual illusions associated with disease. The authors point out that recent fMRI studies have shown somewhat analogous effects in the visual system, with the primary visual cortex involved in some conscious visual illusions. It's still unclear if this phenomenon will hold for all other perceptual systems as well, but future studies can now explore how the brain bridges the gap between actual stimulation and conscious experience."

It is still unclear, however, if these stromal changes are of benefit to the host or the tumour. We hypothesise that stromal maturity is an important reflection of tumour biology, and thus can be used to predict prognosis. The aim of this study is to develop a texture analysis methodology which will automatically classify stromal regions from images of hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H and E) sections into two categories: mature and immature. Subsequently we will investigate whether stromal maturity could be used as a predictor of survival and also as a means to better understand the relationship between the radiological imaging signal and the underlying tissue microstructure.

We enrolled twenty-four patients with heterozygous FH (age 51.0 ± 20.0 year; male, 50%; 20 cases with LDL receptor mutation, 1 case with proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) E32K and 3 cases without confirmed mutations).

There were also positive correlations of sLR11 with apoE, IDL-C and average ATT. Multivariate regression analysis showed that there were positive correlations of sLR11 to IDL-C and HbA1c independent of age and BMI. In another multivariate regression analysis on the relationships of average ATT as a dependent variable with age, BMI and sLR11 (IDL-C and HbA1c) as independent variables, sLR11 had a positive correlation with average ATT, independent of age and BMI. However, this independency did not persist after adding IDL-C and HbA1c as confounding factors. Of special note is that HbA1c showed a significant correlation with average ATT, independent of other parameters including sLR11.#R##N#Conclusion#R##N#It is crucial to intervene in the existence of remnant lipoprotein as well as hypercholesterolemia from an early stage and conduct glycemic control to prevent the progression of atherosclerotic disease in FH."

To cluster data, many methods such as K-Means, Fuzzy C-Means(FCM), Mountain Method(MM), and etc, have been proposed and used. But the clustering results of conventional methods are sensitively influenced by initial values given for clustering in each method. Especially, FCM is very sensitive to noisy data, and cluster center distortion phenomenon is occurred because the method dose clustering through minimization of within-clusters variance. In this paper, we propose a clustering method which reduces cluster center distortion through merging the nearest data based on the data weight, and not being influenced by initial values. We show the effectiveness of the proposed through experimental results applied it to various types of data sets, and comparison of cluster centers with those of FCM."

FHF is associated with a wide spectrum of neuropsychiatric alterations ranging from stupor to coma, culminating in death. In the present study FHF was induced in rats by the administration of thioacetamide (TAA). Oxidative stress is thought to play a prominent role in the pathophysiology of cerebral changes during FHF leading to the assumption that antioxidants might offer protection. Hence, in the present study the protective effect of C-Phycocyanin (C-PC), a natural antioxidant, was evaluated on TAA-induced tissue damage.  C-Phycocyanin was administered intraperitoneally twice at 24 h interval (50 mg/kg body weight) along with the hepatotoxin TAA (300 mg/kg body weight). The animals were sacrificed 18 h after the second injection of TAA treatment and various biochemical parameters were analysed in liver, serum and brain tissues. These studies revealed significant prevention of TAA-induced liver damage by C-PC, as evidenced by a) increase in survival rate; b) the prevention of leakage of liver enzymes (AAT and AST) and ammonia into serum; c) increase in prothrombin time and d) liver histopathology. Ultrastructural studies of astrocytes of different regions of brain clearly showed a decrease in edema after C-PC treatment. TAA-induced histopathological lesions in different regions of the brain namely cerebral cortex, cerebellum and pons medulla were significantly reduced by the co-administration of C-PC with TAA. Further C-PC treatment resulted in a) decrease in the levels of tryptophan and markers of lipid peroxidation and b) elevation in the activity levels of catalase, glutathione peroxidase in different regions of brain. These studies reveal the potential of C-PC in ameliorating TAA-induced hepatic encephalopathy by improving antioxidant defenses."

With the modeling, we fit the observed angular distribution of solar particles and infer, for a particular particle instrument and magnetic field orientation, the time delay of the particle registration at 1 AU in respect to the solar source. Then, after the time offset removal, intensity re-normalization and background equalization, the time–intensity profiles of high-energy protons, helium and electrons in different energy channels are superposed and compared. The comparison reveals episodes of remarkable coincidence of different profiles, as well as episodes of essentially different behavior. It implies at least three sources of solar high-energy particles operating in a single event. The first, short-duration source emits electrons next to the flare's impulsive phase and CME liftoff. The second source gradually rises and continues for more than an hour, emitting electrons and lower energy protons, which is consistent with shock acceleration on open magnetic field lines extending to solar wind.

The key to computed tomography imaging in the big picture is not in the acquisition of data, but in the use of the data acquired. By supplementing traditional axial interpretation with 3-dimensional rendering of the computed tomography volume, the greatest amount of information available is extracted. The information provided by a comprehensive postprocessed study, which includes multiplanar reconstruction in the coronal, sagittal, and oblique plane, as well as 3-dimensional maps of both the arterial and venous phase datasets using volume rendering and maximum intensity projection techniques, allows for key clinical decisions to be made with a high degree of accuracy. Postprocessing of computed tomography data is thus no longer an option, but a true requirement in this era of 64-row multidetector computed tomography and beyond.

Such interactions were discovered initially for short-lived mRNAs encoding cytokines and early genes like c-jun and c-myc. However, they may also determine the fate of more stable mRNAs in a tissue and disease-dependent manner. The interactions between the  cis -acting elements and the  trans -acting factors may also be modulated by Ca 2+  either directly or via a control of the phosphorylation status of the  trans -acting factors. We focus initially on the basic concepts in mRNA stability with the  trans -acting factors AUF1 (destabilizing) and HuR (stabilizing). Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2+  pumps, SERCA2a (cardiac and slow twitch muscles) and SERCA2b (most cells including smooth muscle cells), are pivotal in Ca 2+  mobilization during signal transduction. SERCA2a and SERCA2b proteins are encoded by relatively stable mRNAs that contain  cis -acting stability determinants in their 3′-regions. We present several pathways where 3′-UTR mediated mRNA decay is key to Ca 2+  signalling: SERCA2a and β-adrenergic receptors in heart failure, renin–angiotensin system, and parathyroid hormones. Other examples discussed include cytokines vascular endothelial growth factor, endothelin and endothelial nitric oxide synthase. Roles of Ca 2+  and Ca 2+ -binding proteins in mRNA stability are also discussed. We anticipate that these novel modes of control of protein expression will form an emerging area of research that may explore the central role of Ca 2+  in cell function during development and in disease."

Herein, cubic quantum dot/hexagonal microsphere ZnIn2S4 heterophase junctions were constructed by a two-step process. First, hexagonal ZnIn2S4 microspheres with abundant sulfur vacancies were prepared to act as ideal matrixes via a solvothermal process. Then cubic ZnIn2S4 quantum dots were decorated on the surface of the hexagonal ZnIn2S4 microspheres to form heterophase junctions using a hydrothermal growth method. The characterization of valence band X-ray photoelectron spectra and UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra proves that the cubic quantum dot/hexagonal microsphere ZnIn2S4 phase junction establishes a type-II band alignment with nanosized interfaces, which accounts for the efficient transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers. Meanwhile, the existing sulfur vacancies in the heterophase junctions can provide more electron trapping sites for proton reduction. Thus the optimal cubic quantum dot/hexagonal microsphere ZnIn2S4 heterophase junction exhibits exceptional visible light photocatalytic performance for H2 production (114.2 μmol h−1) without any cocatalyst, which is 7.3 and 3.2 times higher than that of cubic and hexagonal ZnIn2S4, respectively. This study provides a simple route for the synthesis of heterophase junction catalysts for photocatalytic applications."

Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography plays a crucial role in the evaluation of these features of IPMN. Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) has proven to be more sensitive than computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging for early detection of malignancy. The present review addresses the current roles of endoscopy and related techniques in the management of IPMN. The particular focus is on diagnosing IPMN and malignancy within IPMN, detecting pancreatic cancer concomitant with IPMN, differentiating the epithelial subtypes of IPMN, determining the optimal strategy for the management of branch duct IPMN, and discussing innovative endoscopic technology related to IPMN. The disadvantages of endoscopic examinations of IPMN and different attitudes toward EUS-guided fine-needle aspiration for IPMN between Japan (negative) and other countries (active) are also discussed."

In this study, we dissected the subcellular events in which these kinases are involved during cell death. Expression of each of these DAPk subfamily members in their activated forms triggered two major cytoplasmic events: membrane blebbing, characteristic of several types of cell death, and extensive autophagy, which is typical of autophagic (type II) programmed cell death. These two different cellular outcomes were totally independent of caspase activity. It was also found that dominant negative mutants of DAPk or DRP-1 reduced membrane blebbing during the p55/tumor necrosis factor receptor 1–induced type I apoptosis but did not prevent nuclear fragmentation. In addition, expression of the dominant negative mutant of DRP-1 or of DAPk antisense mRNA reduced autophagy induced by antiestrogens, amino acid starvation, or administration of interferon-γ. Thus, both endogenous DAPk and DRP-1 possess rate-limiting functions in these two distinct cytoplasmic events. Finally, immunogold staining showed that DRP-1 is localized inside the autophagic vesicles, suggesting a direct involvement of this kinase in the process of autophagy."

Therefore, the engineering and characterization of 'hot spots' have attracted much attention. Herein, we have synthesized nanoworms formed by connecting hollow gold nanospheres and investigated their composition as Well is their SERS properties, including their potential for simultaneous analysis of multiple species. The three-dimensional nanostructures that led to different SERS activities were investigated using correlated optical/SERS and SEM imaging. Gold nanoworms with hollow nanosphere segments and partial tube formation were confirmed. All highly SERS-active structures were found to be three-dimensional arrays consisting of inter-/intrananoworm interactions; no individual nanospheres were found to give significant SERS signal under the experimental conditions. The major SERS contribution was found to be the electromagnetic coupling effect within the three-dimensional arrays and the localized surface plasmon resonance of the nanostructure was found to have a minimal effect. This study gives insight into the basis of enhancement for these nanoworm structures and adds to the growing body evidence in relation to nanostructures and surface enhancement of Raman scattering."

Guidelines are presented for constructing models with stable defect structures that maintain high numerical efficiency. The general framework combines both long-range elastic fields and basic features of atomic-level core structures, with defect dynamics operable over diffusive time scales. Fundamental elements of the resulting defect physics are characterized for the case of fcc crystals. Stacking faults and split Shockley partial dislocations are stabilized for the first time within the PFC formalism, and various properties of associated defect structures are characterized. These include the dissociation width of perfect edge and screw dislocations, the effect of applied stresses on dissociation, Peierls strains for glide, and dynamic contraction of gliding pairs of partials. Our results in general are shown to compare favorably with continuum elastic theories and experimental findings."

As for the simplest case, it predicts an inevitable gap closing in the Heisenberg chain of half-integer spins. Its relation to the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem is discussed based on the symmetries of the twisted Hamiltonian. The discussion is also extended to the (approximately) degenerate multiplet and fermion cases. It restricts the number of the states in the low energy cluster of the spectrum by the filling of the fermions. Constraints by the reflection symmetry are also discussed."

A thematic network analysis showed that the situations were constantly evolving and different players participated by bringing their own perspectives. In this process alliances were formed that reflected underlying dynamics of power.

The fundamental idea behind Morse theory is that of combining the topological exploration of a shape with quantitative measurement of geometrical properties provided by a real function defined on the shape. The added value of approaches based on Morse theory is in the possibility of adopting different functions as shape descriptors according to the properties and invariants that one wishes to analyze. In this sense, Morse theory allows one to construct a  general framework  for shape characterization, parametrized with respect to the mapping function used, and possibly the space associated with the shape. The mapping function plays the role of a  lens  through which we look at the properties of the shape, and different functions provide different insights.   In the last decade, an increasing number of methods that are rooted in Morse theory and make use of properties of real-valued functions for describing shapes have been proposed in the literature. The methods proposed range from approaches which use the configuration of contours for encoding topographic surfaces to more recent work on size theory and persistent homology. All these have been developed over the years with a specific target domain and it is not trivial to systematize this work and understand the links, similarities, and differences among the different methods. Moreover, different terms have been used to denote the same mathematical constructs, which often overwhelm the understanding of the underlying common framework.   The aim of this survey is to provide a clear vision of what has been developed so far, focusing on methods that make use of theoretical frameworks that are developed for  classes  of real functions rather than for a single function, even if they are applied in a restricted manner. The term  geometrical-topological  used in the title is meant to underline that both levels of information content are relevant for the applications of shape descriptions: geometrical, or metrical, properties and attributes are crucial for characterizing specific instances of features, while topological properties are necessary to abstract and classify shapes according to invariant aspects of their geometry. The approaches surveyed will be discussed in detail, with respect to theory, computation, and application. Several properties of the shape descriptors will be analyzed and compared. We believe this is a crucial step to exploit fully the potential of such approaches in many applications, as well as to identify important areas of future research."

The result shows that the sliding mode controller performs better in the transient condition over a wide range of operation when compared with linear controller. Sliding mode controllers by using hysteresis modulation and pulse width modulation are implemented in MATLAB/simulink. The disadvantages of sliding mode controller by using hysteresis modulation is overcome by using pulse width modulation."

The Argument dates at least to the presocratic Greek philosophers, and is largely based on analogical reasoning. Following the appearance of Aquinas'  Summa Theologica  in the 13th century, the Christian Church in Europe embraced a Natural Theology based on observation and reason that allowed it to dominate the entire world of knowledge. Science in turn advanced itself by demonstrating that it could be of service to theology, the recognized queen of the sciences. During the heyday of British Natural Theology in the 17th and 18th centuries, the watchmaker, shipbuilder, and architect analogies were invoked reflexively by philosophers, theologians, and scientists. The Design Argument was not systematically and analytically criticized until David Hume wrote  Dialogues on Natural Religion  in the 1750s. After Darwin published  Origin of Species  in 1859, Design withered on the vine. But in recent years, the Argument has been resurrected under the appellation “intelligent design,” and been the subject of political and legal controversy in the United States. Design advocates have argued that intelligent design can be formulated as a scientific hypothesis, that new scientific discoveries validate a design inference, and that naturalism must be removed as a methodological requirement in science. If science is defined by a model of concentric epistemological zonation, design cannot be construed as a scientific hypothesis because it is inconsistent with the core aspects of scientific methodology: naturalism, uniformity, induction, and efficient causation. An analytical examination of claims by design advocates finds no evidence of any type to support either scientific or philosophical claims that design can be unambiguously inferred from nature. The apparent irreducible complexity of biological mechanisms may be explained by exaptation or scaffolding. The argument that design is indicated by the fine-tuning of the universe as a habitat suitable for life is based on an intellectual fallacy of assigning probability to a unique event. Construing the Design Argument as an “inference to the best explanation,” rather than analogical reasoning is essentially an equivocation fallacy that does not rescue the Argument from Hume's criticisms. The intelligent design movement is a threat to the unity of science, as its confessed goal is to restore Christian theology as the queen of the sciences."

We evaluated the adsorption/desorption behavior of Pu on SWy-1 montmorillonite colloids at pH 4, pH 6, and pH 8 using batch adsorption and flow cell desorption experiments. After 21 days adsorption, Pu(IV) affinity for montmorillonite displayed a pH dependency, with  K  d  values highest at pH 4 and lowest at pH 8. The pH 8 experiment was further allowed to equilibrate for 6 months and showed an increase in  K  d , indicating that true sorption equilibrium was not achieved within the first 21 days. For the desorption experiments, aliquots of the sorption suspensions were placed in a flow cell, and Pu-free solutions were then pumped through the cell for a period of 12 days. Changes in influent solution flow rate were used to investigate the kinetics of Pu desorption and demonstrated that it was rate-limited over the experimental timescales. At the end of the 12-day flow cell experiments, the extent of desorption was again pH dependent, with pH 8 > pH 6 > pH 4. Further, at pH 8, less Pu was desorbed after an adsorption contact time of 6 months than after a contact time of 21 days, consistent with an aging of Pu on the clay surface. A conceptual model for Pu adsorption/desorption that incorporated known surface-mediated Pu redox reactions was used to fit the experimental data. The resulting rate constants indicated processes occurring on timescales of months and even years which may, in part, explain observations of clay colloid-facilitated Pu transport on decadal timescales. Importantly, however, our results also imply that migration of Pu adsorbed to montmorillonite colloids at long (50–100 year) timescales under oxic conditions may not be possible without considering additional phenomena, such as co-precipitation."

Current interferon-based therapy is of limited efficacy and has significant side effects and more effective and better tolerated therapies are urgently needed. HCV is a positive, single-stranded RNA virus with a 9.6 kb genome that encodes ten viral proteins. Among them, the NS3 protease and the NS5B polymerase are essential for viral replication and have been the main focus of drug discovery efforts. Aided by structure-based drug design, potent and specific inhibitors of NS3 and NS5B have been identified, some of which are in late stage clinical trials and may significantly improve current HCV treatment. Inhibitors of other viral targets such as NS5A are also being pursued. However, HCV is an RNA virus characterized by high replication and mutation rates and consequently, resistance emerges quickly in patients treated with specific antivirals as monotherapy. A complementary approach is to target host factors such as cyclophilins that are also essential for viral replication and may present a higher genetic barrier to resistance. Combinations of these inhibitors of different mechanism are likely to become the essential components of future HCV therapies in order to maximize antiviral efficacy and prevent the emergence of resistance."

The measurement of basal salivary cortisol (BSaC) instead of basal serum cortisol (BSeC) offers some advantages, such as painless sampling and the determination of the free hormone. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic value of BSeC and BSaC in comparison to the insulin tolerance test (ITT). Seventy-seven patients with hypothalamic-pituitary disease and 184 healthy controls were enrolled. ITT were performed in patients, and BSeC as well as BSaC levels were measured in patients and controls. Upper and lower thresholds (with ≥95% specificity either for adrenal sufficiency or adrenal insufficiency) were calculated by ROC analysis both for BSeC and BSaC. The ITT identified 41 patients as adrenal insufficient and 36 patients as adrenal sufficient. Upper and lower cutoffs were 470 and 103 nmol/l for BSeC, and 21.1 and 5.0 nmol/l for BSaC, respectively. Thereby, basal cortisol allowed a highly specific diagnosis (i.e., similar to the ITT result) in either 23% (BSeC) or 27% (BSaC) of patients. We suggest the determination of unstimulated early morning cortisol as first-line screening method for the diagnosis of secondary adrenal insufficiency. If upper and lower cutoffs are used, dynamic testing could be obviated in about one fourth of cases. Due to its easy and painless collection BSaC may be preferable to BSeC."

Although CD95R cervical carcinoma cells expressed even higher levels of p53 and CD95 receptor at the surface, resistance could be attributed to the inability to form a functional DISC, necessary for successful transmission of the apoptogenic response.

Up to ionic strengths of about 70 mM, the elongation rate increases with salt concentration. This increase is nonspecific with regard to the salts. Below ionic strengths of ∼50 mM, it can be explained by a Debye-Huckel type model, indicating a dominant role of Coulomb interactions between the charged reactants and products screened by the ionic environment.

Methods: The study population consisted of 162 patients with anti-HCV antibodies and HCV-RNA. HCV genotypes were determined using genotype specific primers. Results: HCV genotype 2a predominated (62.3%), followed by genotype 1b (34.0%) and 2b (3.7%). The prevalence of genotypes differed significantly with age, with HCV genotypes 1 and 2 being more frequent in older and younger subjects (P=0.035), respectively. HCV-RNA levels were higher in patients with genotype 1 than in those with genotype 2 (P=0.001). HCV genotype was not significantly related to sex, clinical diagnosis and potential risk factors. Conclusions: HCV genotype 2a is most common in Jeju, followed by genotype 1b. Our results suggest that the distribution of the HCV genotype differs between regions in Korea.

Various mathematical models were developed, and a preferred model was identified. A linear regression model that uses bus line headway as the only independent variable to predict passenger waiting times was given for transit planning purposes. A great difference between the traditional random model and the study model was examined. With the use of structural breaks on the basis of an econometric analysis approach for the first time, several insights into the numerical results were provided.

Nbm may be a predisposing factor for Wilms' tumour (WT). The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the impact of Nbm on the outcome of WT in children. We assessed the outcome of 81 children with Wilms tumours and practical implications of Nbm in the treatment and follow-up. All the pathology slides have been reviewed in 1997. 63 had WT without Nbm (group A) and 18 had WT associated with Nbm (group B). There was no statistical difference between the two groups according to the age at diagnosis and histology. Clinical abnormalities were more frequent in group B (33 versus 8%). There was no statistical difference between the percentage of stage IV in both groups, but bilaterality (stage V) was present only in the group B. Relapse was observed in 20/81 patients (25%): 11 (17%) in group A and 9 (50%) in group B. Mean delay of relapse was longer (25 months) in group B than in group A (10 months). For the whole population, with a median follow-up of 9 years, the event-free survival (EFS) and the overall survival (OS) probabilities were respectively 74%±10 and 83%±9 at 120 months. The difference in EFS between groups A (82±9%) and B (38%±29) was significant ( P =0.004). The discovery of Nbm in the non-tumoral part of the kidney with WT can be an adverse factor and in particular favours the subsequent development of a new Wilms tumour. It justifies separate follow-up guidelines."

Starting from the general two-atom master equation, we analytically derive the elastic and inelastic background and interference components of the double scattering spectrum. By expressing the final results in terms of single-atom observables, the two-atom problem is shown to be equivalent to a description in terms of single atoms under bichromatic driving."

Material and Methods: between 1995 and 2012, we had 181 patients in whom it was necessary to make simultaneous urinary and fecal diversion. this is a retrospective study and patients were divided into two groups, depending on the technique applied for the fecal and urinary diversion. the first group consisted of patients undergoing ileal conduit and terminal colostomy and the second group consisted of patients undergoing doublebarreled wet colostomy. Results: ileal conduit and terminal colostomy was performed in 77 (43%) cases, while wet colostomy was performed in 104 (57%) cases. median length of stay was shorter for double-barreled wet colostomy (13.1 vs 18.1, p < 0.0001). median operating times for urinary and fecal diversion were shorter for double-barreled wet colostomy (32 vs 64 min, p < 0.0001). the morbidity was lower for double-barreled wet colostomy (11.5% vs 23.4%, p = 0.0432), retrospectively. the mortality was 3.8% for double-barreled wet colostomy and 10.3% for ileal conduit and terminal colostomy group (p = 0.1282). Conclusions: Double-barreled wet colostomy is a safe, fast, and simple alternative to traditional ileal conduit and terminal colostomy diversion. the technique is relatively easy to learn, and it reduces the time for urinary and fecal diversion, length of stay, and morbidity rate."

We investigate higher order nonlinear effects on the evolution of solitary waves by comparing our numerical solutions of the model with weakly nonlinear solutions. We carry out the local stability analysis of solitary wave solution of the model and identify an instability mechanism of the Kelvin-Helmholtz type. With parameters in the stable range, we simulate the interaction of two solitary waves: both head-on and overtaking collisions. We also study the deformation of a solitary wave propagating over non-uniform topography and describe the process of disintegration in detail. Our numerical solutions unveil new dynamical behaviors of large amplitude internal solitary waves, to which any weakly nonlinear model is inapplicable."

A literature search was conducted in Medline, Lilacs, BDENF, CINAHL and in SciELO virtual library databases, by crossing the descriptors Education in Health, Elderly, Aging, Elderly Health, Health Promotion and Quality of Life, including articles conducted with elderly people published from 2003 to 2013, in English, Spanish and Portuguese. Eight articles, which presented quality of life and promotion of healthy aging as a result of health education strategies, were selected. Health education actions for elderly need methodologies that attend the complexity of the aging process and correlate the factors surrounding the individual, such as beliefs, values, norms and ways of life."

The effect of texture on the rate of grain growth is discussed in terms of the motion of the grain boundary triple junctions in the two samples with different distributions of grain-to-grain misorientations.

On the other hand, it will increase aerodynamic drag; consequently the increased drag diminishes turbine power generation. Thus, an aerodynamic drag reducing technique should be accompanied with the flatback trailing edge in order to prevent loss of turbine power generation. In this work, a drag mitigation design, span-wise wavy trailing edge blade, has been applied to a modern 100meter blade. The span-wise trailing edge acts as a vortex generator, and breaks up the strong span-wise coherent trailing edge vortex structure at the flatback airfoil trailing edge which is a major source of large drag. Three-dimensional unsteady Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations have been performed for real scale wind turbine blade geometries. Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES) with the modified laminar-turbulent transition model has been applied to obtain accurate flow field predictions. Graphical Processor Unit (GPU)-accelerated computation has been conducted to reduce computational costs of the real scale wind turbine blade simulations. To verify the structural reliability of the wavy modification of the blade a simple Eigen buckling analysis has been performed in the current study."

Sixteen young men who did not have RET experience in the past were randomly divided in 2 groups. Hypertrophy-intensity group (n = 9) performed 3 sets of 12 repetitions at an intensity corresponding to 70% of 1 repetition maximum (1RM), whereas strength-intensity group (n = 7) performed 3 sets of 6 repetitions at an intensity corresponding to 85% of 1RM. Resistance exercise training involved 6 exercises, and it was performed 3 times a week on nonconsecutive days for 6 weeks. Blood samples were obtained just before (pre-RET) and immediately after RET (post-RET) on the first day of the first week, on the last day of the fourth and sixth weeks. The results indicated that malondialdehyde (MDA) significantly decreased (p   0.05). After 6 weeks of training, pre-RET values of MDA significantly decreased and pre-RET values of GSH significantly increased in both hypertrophy- and strength-intensity groups (p < 0.05). These alterations occurred independently of training intensity. This study indicated that hypertrophy- and strength-intensity whole-body RET performed regularly for 6 weeks, decreased MDA concentration and increased GSH level in healthy young men. Results suggest that chronic RET has protective effects against oxidative stress similar to aerobic exercises and that these effects seem to be independent of the training intensity."

It is important to know whether wetlands reclamation would affect soil invertebrates, especially the winter-active invertebrates. During November 2011 to April 2012, we used pitfall traps and in-field direct observation methods to study the activity of collembolans in wetland, and a reclaimed forest plantation and soybean field. In total, 3465 collembolans were captured and identified to 8 species from 6 families. Desoria sp. 1, Desoria sp. 2 and Desoria sp. 3 were the three dominant species. Collembolan abundance and assemblages were significantly affected by the land use changes. The results showed that (1) Collembola captured by pitfall traps showed a highest abundance in wetland, with ∼50% decreased abundance in soybean field, and ∼75% decreased in the forest plantation. (2) Collembola activity changed during the winter season, their activity significantly increased from early winter to late winter; with a peak in March in all three land use types. (3) Collembola assemblages were affected by land use changes with a significant decrease of frequency of Desoria sp. 3 and a significant increase of frequency of Desoria sp. 2 in soybean field and forest plantation. (4) Collembolan densities on the snow surface usually peaked between 1400 h and 1500 h, and decreased quickly when the temperature dropped below freezing. Mean abundance reached 119 individuals m−2 on the snow surface in wetland, 152 individuals m−2 in soybean field, and 64 individuals m−2 in forest plantation. All collembolans moved up and down through the snow profile depending on temperature, no collembolans were found on the snow surface in the evening. Our study indicated that the reclamation of wetland resulted in a significant decrease of abundance and a different assemblage of winter active Collembola in Northeast China, but land use changes did not change their pattern of activity: Collembolans were rarely active in early and middle winter and mostly active in late winter. Their daily densities on the snow surface fluctuated according to both air temperatures and land use types."

The study results indicate that the sweep floc area for raw water shifts into a more acidic region than that for synthetic water due to organic matter present in raw water. Since organic matter has a much higher surface area and negative charge than turbidity causing matter, it dominates coagulation and moves the sweep floc area into the acidic region. Turbidity and TOC removal regions mostly overlapped. The difference was in the restabilization region. The restabilization region was wider for turbidity removal than for TOC removal. This study also evaluated floc structures using fractal dimensions. For this purpose, three different methods [automatic image analysis (AIA) and small angle laser light scattering (SALLS)] were used to calculate fractal dimensions of flocs formed under different coagulation mechanisms. There was no difference detected between fractal dimensions of the flocs by the AIA method. The SALLS method was, however, able to detect the difference between the flocs. Flocs formed under sweep-floc coagulation were larger and more compact than those formed under charge neutralization."

Skin permeation study was conducted in Franz diffusion cells using excised hairless mouse skins. MT was analyzed by HPLC. As vehicles, ethanol (EtOH), polyethylene glycol 400 (PEG), or propylene glycol (PG) was used alone or mixed with a phosphate buffer. Binary vehicles (EtOH/buffer, PEG/buffer, PG/buffer) showed different effects on the skin permeation of MT and its lag time. Compared with the buffer alone, the PEG/buffer shortened the lag time of MT but reduced its skin permeation. EtOH/buffer significantly increased the flux of MT but prolonged the lag time with the content of EtOH. PG/buffer did not affect the lag time but slightly increased the skin permeation of MT at the higher content of PG (≥80%). These results indicate that the composition of vehicles exerts significant influence but it per se might have limitation in modulating the transdermal delivery of MT. Next, one tested whether fatty acids could more effectively enhance the skin permeation of MT and shorten its lag time. Given the influence of vehicles on both permeation and lag time, PG was used as a vehicle for fatty acids. The permeation-enhancing effects of saturated fatty acids increased in the following order: C10>C12>C14>C16>C18. The saturated fatty acid, however, did not significantly shorten the lag time regardless of the carbon chain length. Meanwhile, similar to saturated lauric acid (C12), unsaturated oleic acid (C18) dramatically enhanced the skin permeability coefficient of MT more than 950-fold over the effect of PG alone. Moreover, oleic acid showed the shortest lag time (2.1 h). The results suggest that oleic acid in a suitable vehicle could more effectively enhance the skin permeation of MT and shorten its lag time than did the vehicles of various compositions."

Following in the footsteps of Rabindranath Tagore, Satyajit Ray, Renu, and J. P. S. Uberoi, Ghosh dramatizes the encounter between Western science, with its accompanying epistemology, and Indian tradition. The novel challenges the relentless West-driven search for knowledge, epitomized by the supercomputer named Ava, and suggests that only different epistemological premises, based on silence, can counteract Western rationalism. The novel’s literary technique mirrors this preoccupation in that it tells a story from two different viewpoints, one of which remains silent throughout. Narrating the viewpoint of a silent agent raises a number of problems as to the reliability of the narrator, who properly speaking is only a “guesser.” The whole narrative revolves around a foundational mystery that remains unknown to all characters. In order to do so, the implied author must write about something of which he too remains ignorant. This paradoxical condition calls for a revision of the traditional writing agents as described by Wayne C. Booth, so that it is necessary to include the figure of the archiauthor behind the traditional implied author. This may explain a reticent narrative that relies heavily on the reader’s intelligence. Furthermore, my narratological reading highlights two themes formerly neglected by scholars, namely that subalterns’ cosmopolitanism in the future is rooted in our colonial past and that the interpersonal transference envisaged by the novel merges different people in one body, thus challenging the Western obsession with individualism."

This study contributes to the literature on FSAs through the use of a unique dataset that provides three years of employee-level matched benefits data. Motivated by the theoretical model of FSA choice presented in Cardon and Showalter (2001), we examine the determinants of FSA participation and contribution levels using cross sectional and random effect two part models. FSA participation and health plan choice are also modeled jointly in each year using conditional logit models. We find that, even after controlling for a number of other demographic characteristics, non-whites are less likely to participate in the FSA program, have lower contributions conditional on participation, and have a lower probability of switching to new lower cost share, higher premium plans when they were introduced. We also find evidence that choosing health plans with more expected out-of-pocket expenses is correlated with use of the FSA program."

The SMEA consists of an elastomeric substrate, such as poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS), elastically stretchable gold conductors, and an electrically insulating encapsulating layer in which contact holes are opened. We demonstrate the feasibility of producing contact holes with 40 µm × 40 µm openings, show why the adhesion of the encapsulation layer to the underlying silicone substrate is weakened during contact hole fabrication, and provide remedies. These improvements result in greatly increased fabrication yield and reproducibility. An SMEA with 28 microelectrodes was fabricated. The contact holes (100 µm × 100 µm) in the encapsulation layer are only  10% the size of the previous generation, allowing a larger number of microelectrodes per unit area, thus affording the capability to interface with a smaller neural population per electrode. This new SMEA is used to record spontaneous and evoked activity in organotypic hippocampal tissue slices at 0% strain before stretching, at 5 % and 10 % equibiaxial strain, and again at 0% strain after relaxation. The noise of the recordings increases with increasing strain. The frequency of spontaneous neural activity also increases when the SMEA is stretched. Upon relaxation, the noise returns to pre-stretch levels, while the frequency of neural activity remains elevated. Stimulus-response curves at each strain level are measured. The SMEA shows excellent biocompatibility for at least two weeks."

Although it has a lot of potential applications, a wireless sensor network is highly energy constrained. Limited energy resource to the sensor becomes an obstacle for its applications and efficient usage of energy helps in improving the network lifetime. Suppose a network has a high-density of sensor nodes, there will be lots of problems such as the intersection of sensing, redundant data, communication interference and energy waste. So it is necessary to set up a management application to maintain these resources. On the other hand, a high-density network can be fault tolerant and more accurate than low-density sensor networks. In this paper, we proposed a new scheduling for sensor networks which can decide the nodes to be on or off and maintain the coverage area for the original one. This management schema may take a node out of service temporally in order to save energy. Our design uses a Voronoi Diagram, which decomposes the sensing area into regions around each node."

The functionality of these devices can be tailored to suit any specific application such as optical filters, sensors and optical memory . However, the coupling of light into these miniature devices has always been a challenge, in particular, when light transits the waveguide region to the photonic crystal structures. This modal transition results in scattering losses leading to low optical transmission. In this work, two-dimensional photonic crystal microcavity filter structures with mode -matching features embedded in ridge waveguides have been designed using Finite Domain Time Difference modeling tool and fabricated on GaAs/AlGaAs substrate using Electron Beam Lithography and Reactive Ion Etching. An increase in optic al transmission of about 80 % is obtained by the addition of the mode -matching features.

Although the effects of these PHC on seedling growth are relatively explored, not many information is available regarding the phytotoxicity on ecophysiological processes of perennial ryegrass adult plants. The experiment was conducted with the aim to evaluate the phytotoxic potential of PHC on the seedling growth, leaf water relation, chlorophyll fluorescence attributes and carbon isotope discrimination adult plants of perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.). The results clearly indicated that PHC behaved as potent inhibitors of chlorophyll fluorescence yield (Fv/Fm) in leaves of L. perenne and plants showed poor tolerance against allelochemicals stress. Quantum yield (ΦPSII), chlorophyll fluorescence quenching (qP) and non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) were decreased following exposure to FA and pHBA. The portion of absorbed photon energy that was thermally dissipated (D) in L. perenne was decreased. Exposure of the L. perenne seedlings to FA and pHBA stress led to a decrease in fresh/dry weight, relative water content and leaf osmotic potential. Carbon isotope composition ratio (δ13C) was significantly less negative than the control following treatment with FA or pHBA. The results suggested that PHC uptake was a key step for the effectiveness of these secondary metabolites and their phytotoxicity on L. perenne adult plants was mainly due to the alteration of leaf water status accompanied by photosystem II damage. Acquisition of such knowledge may ultimately provide a better understanding about the mode of action of the tested compounds."

Two concrete pictures of such cooperativity are discussed: Sequences of coupled particle jumps as occur in kinetically constrained lattice-gas models, and fluctuations of collective flow as are apparent in MD simulations of simple liquids of high density. Collective flow quantitatively explains the size dependence of the velocity-autocorrelation functions (VAFs) at intermediate and long times in a very dense binary liquid of hard spheres. A substantial size dependence of the VAFs is also found at short times t < 7 τ , where τ is the mean time of free flight, which so far is unexplained. The size dependence of the self-diffusion coefficients of the mixture depends sensitively on this short-time behaviour."

Concerns have been raised over shrub and tree encroachment, changes in species composition and decreasing species richness in coastal dunes with nitrogen (N) deposition and loss of natural dynamics acknowledged as pressures. We tested the effects of N-deposition and disturbance on Danish dune grassland vegetation. We applied simulated trampling, grazing, blowouts and N-deposition in a randomized design to ten sites along the major natural gradient in the area. After three years we recorded plant, bryophyte and lichen biomass as well as species frequency, foliar N and P, soil pH and soil organic matter content. We hypothesized that species richness would increase with disturbance and decrease with N-addition while biomass was expected to increase with N-addition. Disturbance was expected to counteract the effects of N-addition. The hypotheses were tested using linear mixed effects models on species richness, biomass and phylogenetic community structure with treatments and interactions among treatments as explanatory variables and site as a random effect. Although N-deposition affected plant nutrient balance, the effect of N-addition on vegetation was consistently smaller than the effect of disturbance, especially cutting. Disturbances all had the opposite effect to N-addition causing an increase in species richness and decrease of biomass. The subordinate effect of N-addition likely reflects that growth is limited by moisture rather than nitrogen. Disturbances apparently relaxed the ecological filtering during community assembly, resulting in a more diverse community of less related species. Anthropogenic suppression of disturbances by wind, coastal erosion or grazing animals may potentially be a larger threat to dune biodiversity than increased N-deposition."

High-resolution electrical mapping has recently been applied to study complex gastric slow wave spatiotemporal propagations in detail. As these methods are translated to clinical and experimental applications, it is evident that efficient and automated methods are a necessity for analysis. Despite automated methods to detect slow wave events, manual review and correction remains necessary due to the presence of experimental noise in the recordings. Manual deletion of invalid slow wave events is time consuming and inefficient. We have therefore developed an algorithm to eliminate invalid markers of slow waves, via the use of frequency and morphological analysis. The techniques were validated with experimental data using serosal gastric slow wave recordings from animals and humans with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 85%. It is anticipated these methods will facilitate analyzing high-resolution slow wave mapping data and accelerate clinical translation of electrical mapping to clinical and diagnostic gastroentrology."

Most of the existing fabrication methods for polymer nanoparticles and silica xerogel nanoparticles are not applicable for composite nanoparticles. To overcome these difficulties, a novel gelation–emulsion method was successfully developed through the integration of sol–gel and modified double emulsion processes, in which gelation of the silica solution was enabled in nanodroplets generated in the modified emulsion process. Spherical vancomycin loaded silica xerogel/polymer core–shell composite nanoparticles with a tunable size and good drug encapsulation efficiency were fabricated through this novel method. By changing the process variables of the modified double emulsion process in terms of the second sonication time and PVA concentration, the average diameter of the composite nanoparticles could be adjusted in the range of 192–569 nm, with a maximum encapsulation efficiency up to 82.2%. With the introduction of silica xerogel as the primary core material by the sol–gel process, the prepared composite nanoparticles exhibited a higher encapsulation efficiency, lower burst drug release and longer drug complete release time than the polymer nanoparticles by 110%, 37.5% and 230%, respectively, enabling these composite nanoparticles to be better candidates for long-term sustained drug release applications.

The median age at BMT was 17 years (range, 4–46 years). Before BMT, 58% were heavily transfused (>50 transfusions), and 42% had previously experienced treatment failure with antithymocyte globulin-based immunosuppressive therapy. Unmanipulated bone marrow was used as the source of stem cells in all patients except 1. Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis was with cyclosporine alone in 19 (58%) patients; 14 received anti-CD52 MoAb in addition to cyclosporine. The conditioning regimen was well tolerated without significant acute toxicity. Graft failure was seen in 8 patients (primary, n=4; secondary, n=4). Of those whose grafts failed, 4 survived long-term (complete autologous recovery, n=2; rescue with previously stored marrow, n=1; second allograft, n=1). The cumulative incidence of graft failure and grade II to IV acute and chronic GVHD was 24%, 14%, and 4%, respectively. None developed extensive chronic GVHD. With a median follow-up of 59 months, the 5-year survival was 81% (95% confidence interval, 68%-96%). No unexpected early or late infectious or noninfectious complications were observed. We conclude that the conditioning regimen containing cyclophosphamide and anti-CD52 MoAb is well tolerated and effective for acquired aplastic anemia with HLA-matched sibling donors. The favorable effect on the incidence and severity of GVHD is noteworthy in this study and warrants further investigation."

However, an open-channel resonance near threshold limits the range of validity of this model. Such a situation exists when the background scattering length is much larger than the range of the interatomic potential. The open-channel resonance introduces strong threshold effects not included in the single-resonance description. We derive an easy-to-use analytical model that takes into account both the Feshbach resonance and the open-channel resonance. We apply our model to {sup 85}Rb, which has a large background scattering length, and show that the agreement with coupled-channel calculations is excellent. The model can be readily applied to other atomic systems with a large background scattering length, such as {sup 6}Li and {sup 133}Cs. Our approach provides full insight into the underlying physics of the interplay between open-channel (or potential) resonances and Feshbach resonances."

The grayscale integral projection method is used to extract the brightness saliency of flame. Secondly, the flame region of interest (FROI) is acquired by frame difference of flame color, and the region is determined through dispersion and cumulative movement. Finally, the integral saliency map of the current frame is formed by compositing color, brightness and motion saliency.

Model-driven approaches have emerged to support both alternatives via tools. Clearly, these choices are not equivalent.

Motion arcs necessary to complete contemporary tasks such as using a keyboard or cellular telephone have not been studied and could have implications on what is considered to be a functional arc of motion for these tasks. The purpose of this study was to determine elbow range of motion, including flexion-extension, pronation-supination, and varus-valgus angulation, with use of three-dimensional optical tracking technology for several previously described positional and functional tasks along with various contemporary tasks.#N##N#Methods: Twenty-five patients performed six positional and eleven functional tasks (both historical and contemporary). Elbow flexion-extension, varus-valgus, and forearm rotation (pronation and supination) ranges of motion were measured.#N##N#Results: Positional tasks required a minimum (mean and standard deviation) of 27° ± 7° of flexion and a maximum of 149° ± 5° of flexion. Forearm rotation ranged from 20.0° ± 18° of pronation to 104° ± 10° of supination. Varus and valgus angulations ranged between 2° ± 5° of varus to 9° ± 5° of valgus. For functional tasks, the maximum flexion arc was 130° ± 7°, with a minimum value recorded as 23° ± 6° and a maximum value recorded as 142° ± 3°. All of these were for the cellular telephone task. The maximum pronation-supination arc (103° ± 34°) was found with using a fork. Maximum pronation was found with typing on a keyboard (65° ± 8°). Maximum supination was found with opening a door (77° ± 13°). Maximum varus-valgus arc of motion was 11° ± 4°. Minimum valgus (0° ± 6°) was found with cutting with a knife, while maximum valgus (13° ± 6°) was found with opening a door.#N##N#Conclusions: Functional elbow range of motion necessary for activities of daily living may be greater than previously reported. Contemporary tasks, such as using a computer mouse and keyboard, appear to require greater pronation than other tasks, and using a cellular telephone usually requires greater flexion than other tasks."

Growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153 (GADD153) is a member of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) family of transcription factors; it is expressed at low levels under normal conditions but strongly induced upon growth arrest, DNA damage, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. This study investigated the effect of garcinol on Hep3B cells, a human hepatocellular cancer cell line lacking functional p53, with the goal of elucidating the molecular mechanisms of p53-independent apoptosis in hepatocellular cancer. Overall, garcinol activated not only the death receptor and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathways but also the ER stress modulator GADD153. Garcinol treatment led to the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), increased GADD153 expression, and reduced mitochondrial membrane potential. An increase in the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio resulted in enhanced apoptosis. Caspase-8 and tBid (truncated Bid) expression also increased in a time-dependent manner. The enzymatic activities of caspase-3 and caspase-9 increased approximately 13-fold and 7.8-fold, respectively. In addition, the proteolytic cleavage of poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation factor-45 (DFF-45) increased in dose- and time-dependent manners. Our data suggest a promising therapeutic application of garcinol in p53-independent apoptosis in cancers."

Numerically, the procedure performs well against its competitors not only in selecting fixed effects but in selecting random effects and covariance structure as well.

Lactose modified cements presented an irregular surface with numerous hollows and voids due to the lactose dissolution. HPMC cements presented a characteristic laminated and flaky surface. The drug release of lactose formulations was up to four-fold greater (13%) than the commercial bone cement CMW1® Gentamicin one (3%). The amount of gentamicin eluted at the first withdrawn sample ranged from 30% to 60% of total gentamicin released over the assay. Gentamicin release from lactose formulations increased as lactose percentage was increased which agree with the porosity results. Nevertheless, the use of release modulator HPMC increased porosity, but did not produce an increase in the gentamicin release. HPMC dissolution creates a surrounding sticky and viscous medium similar to a gel that makes the gentamicin release from the cement matrix difficult."

In all cases, only absorption from the triplet excited state was observed, indicating no evidence of a naphthalimide radical anion from dimer excitation. The ground-state interactions of the naphthalimides with four nucleotides were investigated. Nucleotide selectivity was evaluated by determining their individual binding constants (K eq ). The association constants were measured by using absorption, time-resolved fluorescence, and combined time-resolved and steady-state fluorescence. The equilibrium binding constant was largest for association of the spermine-substituted mononaphthalimide with adenosine monophosphate (K eq  = 550 M -1 ) or guanosine monophosphate (K eq  = 440 M -1 ). The dimer form of the disubstituted spermine also showed binding constants in excess of 200 M -1  with the purine nucleotides. The association constant for binding of the pyridinium-substituted naphthalimide showed little dependence on the structure of the nucleotide."

For consumer durables, decisions about such collaboration might be complicated due to two factors. Because of their durability and presence of used goods markets, such products engender 'future' price competition between new and used goods. On the other hand, consumers of such products might be forward-looking and patient, both of which affect their purchasing behavior. In this study, we study how the above product and consumer characteristics interact to affect the group selling decisions of complementary firms. We do so through a two-period model consisting of a value chain with two upstream manufacturers and a downstream retailer. When consumers are relatively impatient and reluctant to wait to buy later, group selling by manufacturers will take place only when the end product is relatively perishable, that is, product durability is low. However, if consumers are patient, that is, willing to wait, collaboration happens only when the end product is quite durable; for relatively perishable products the manufacturers sell their products separately. We also comment on how our results are affected by factors like manufacturers directly selling to end consumers or there being multiple opportunities to decide whether or not to use group selling strategy.

Clinicians, both surgeons as gynaecologist who perform endoscopic surgery without proper training of the specific psychomotor skills, are at higher risk to increased patient morbidity and mortality. Although the apprentice-tutor model has long been a successful approach for training of surgeons, recently, clinicians have recognised that endoscopic surgery requires an important training phase outside the operating theatre. The Gynaecological Endoscopic Surgical Education and Assessment programme (GESEA) recognises the necessity of this structured approach and implements two separated stages in its learning strategy. In the first stage, a skill certificate on theoretical knowledge and specific practical psychomotor skills is acquired through a high-stake exam; in the second stage, a clinical programme is completed to achieve surgical competence and receive the corresponding diploma. Three diplomas can be awarded: (a) the Bachelor in Endoscopy, (b) the Minimally Invasive Gynaecological Surgeon (MIGS) and (c) the Master level. The Master level is sub-divided into two separate diplomas: the Master in Laparoscopic Pelvic Surgery and the Master in Hysteroscopy. The complexity of modern surgery has increased the demands and challenges to surgical education and the quality control. This programme is based on the best available scientific evidence, and it counteracts the problem of the traditional surgical apprentice-tutor model. It is seen as a major step toward standardisation of endoscopic surgical training in general."

In Argentina, it is an important fur resource for rural communities, and there is no evidence of its behaviour as a pest. Between October 2003 and February 2004, studies of habitat use at macro and micro scales were carried out on 6 ponds in a golf course, an artificial urban wetland free from hunting pressure and located within the coypu’s original distribution area. Coypus feed and build their burrows in the ponds but in the absence of hydrophilic vegetation, coypus sought food away from the ponds, covering distances up to 108 m and a feeding area as large as 19 m2. At the macrohabitat scale, the lower the herbaceous vegetation availability at the shore, the greater was the effective usage area. At the microhabitat level, coypus appeared to build their burrows in rather steep slopes (median = 75 cm) or high up on shores rising above the water level (mean = 61.2 cm) selecting ponds with mean values close to the aforementioned figures. The absence of hydrophilous vegetation, natural predators and human activity during the highest activity hours, in addition to suitable food resources around the year are considered to favour the coypu’s behaviour as a pest in these environments."

To perform an assessment of the available literature on manual hyperinflation as a respiratory physical therapy technique used in pediatric patients, with the main outcome of achieving airway clearance. METHODS: We reviewed articles included in the Lilacs (Latin American and Caribbean Literature on Health Sciences/Literatura Latino Americana e do Caribe em Ciencias da Saude), Cochrane Library, Medline (via Virtual Health Library and PubMed), SciELO (Scientific Electronic Library), and PEDro (Physiotherapy Evidence Database) databases from 2002 to 2013 using the following search terms: 'physiotherapy (techniques)', 'respiratory therapy', 'intensive care', and 'airway clearance'. The selected studies were classified according to the level of evidence and grades of recommendation (method of the Oxford Centre for Evidence-Based Medicine) by two examiners, while a third examiner repeated the search and analysis and checked the classification of the articles. RESULTS: Three articles were included for analysis, comprising 250 children (aged 0 to 16 years). The main diagnoses were acute respiratory failure, recovery following heart congenital disease and upper abdominal surgery, bone marrow transplantation, asthma, tracheal reconstruction, brain injury, airway injury, and heterogeneous lung diseases. The studies were classified as having a level of evidence 2C and grade of recommendation C. CONCLUSIONS: Manual hyperinflation appeared useful for airway clearance in the investigated population, although the evidence available in the literature remains insufficient. Therefore, controlled randomized studies are needed to establish the safety and efficacy of manual hyperinflation in pediatric patients. However, manual hyperinflation must be performed by trained physical therapists only."

In a field study (N = 53) and an experiment (N = 72), we showed consistently across samples, methods, and outcomes that the positive effects ofinformational evaluation only existed for individuals who were low in PNS. These findings support the reasoning that high PNS individuals tend to welcome any type of feedback because of its disambiguating potential."

The results showed 2,4-Ddihydrazino-6-methoxy-1,3,5-triaizine (DHMeT) gave the best corrosion protection performance among the other hydrazino derivatives even at a low concentration of 25 ppm (95%). The number of hydrazino groups play an important role in the corrosion inhibition, where the two hydrazine groups increased the electrostatic interactions between the protonated tested compounds, the negatively charged steel surface resulted from the adsorption of the chloride anions, and the presence of the methoxy group made the compound more reliable for formation of film protection on the surface of steel through the lone pair of oxygen atoms. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) measurements suggested that the corrosion process of steel in presence of the hydrazino-s-triazine derivatives (TH3, DMeHT and DHMeT) were being controlled by the charge transfer reaction. Polarization curves indicated that the examined TH3, DMeHT and DHMeT behaved as mixed type inhibitors."

AND OBJECTIVES: Iatrogenic conditions was due of the medical, correctly intervention or not, justified or not, which harmful consequences to the patient. The cares in Intensive Care Medicine present substantial challenges with relation to the security of the patient. The objective of this article is to make one brief revision of literature on the iatrogenic in its concepts and basic terms and its taxes prevalence in Intensive Care Medicine. CONTENTS: Intensive Care Medicine supplies subsidies that improve the morbidity and mortality, but that also the significant risks of adverse events and serious errors associate. The Iatrogenic can be minimized with the adequate monitorization or can be friction as waited aggravation, idiopathic and if to perpetuate in the anonymity. CONCLUSIONS: It is basic to recognize the necessity of the constant learning and recycling and conscience of the susceptibilities to the error; in this context, the respect for the human being must guide the professional behavior."

Data offer perspective, guidance, and insights that inform policy and practice (Newell & Simon, 1972; Kennedy, 1984). Recently, education policymakers have invested in the use of data for organizational improvement in states and districts with such initiatives as Race to The Top (United States Department of Education, 2010) and the development of statewide longitudinal data systems (Institute for Education Sciences, 2010). These and other initiatives focus attention on how data can be used to foster learning and improvement. In other fields, including economics and business, much work has been done to identify leading indicators that predict organizational outcomes. In this paper, we conceptualize how leading indicators might be used in education, using examples from a small sample of school districts with reputations as strong users of data. We define leading indicators as systematically collected data on an activity or condition that is related to a subsequent and valued outcome, as well as the processes surrounding the investigation of those data and the associated responses. Identifying leading indicators often prompts improvements in a district’s system of supports. To develop this concept, we describe four examples of how districts identified and used key indicators to anticipate learning problems and improve student outcomes. We also describe the infrastructure and other supports that districts need to sustain this ambitious form of data use. We conclude by discussing how leading indicators can bring about more intelligent use of data in education."

Changes in incidence and average annual percent change (AAPC) were studied with join-point analyses. Overall and sarcoma-related mortalities were assessed using the Kaplan–Meier and competing risk methods, respectively.  Results  A total of 900 second sarcomas were identified comprising 7.5% of all sarcomas. The AAPC of second sarcoma incidence was 6.2 (95% CI=5.7–6.7) as compared to 2.5 (95% CI=2.1–2.8) for all sarcomas and 2.5 (95% CI=2.4–2.6) for cancer in general. The annual incidence of second sarcomas doubled during the last decade of the study period. The distribution of histological subtypes was significantly different between second and sporadic sarcomas. The overall mortality was significantly higher and sarcoma-related mortality was significantly lower for patients with a second sarcoma compared to sporadic sarcoma.  Conclusions  There is an increasing incidence of second sarcomas among cancer survivors, and one may speculate a relation to the intensified use of cytotoxic treatment of the preceding malignancy. Sarcoma–related mortality after second sarcomas is significantly below that of sporadic sarcoma."

In the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS), two patterns emerge. First, low income individuals are more likely to visit emergency rooms than high income individuals, and this gap is disproportionately larger for working age individuals. Second, although the differences between high and low income individuals in non-emergency medical conditions are little in early life, the gap in non-emergency medical conditions is substantial in middle and late life. To explain these facts, I build an overlapping generations general equilibrium model that features (i) endogenous decisions on default and health insurance, (ii) endogenous health that determines labor productivity, (iii) the existence of emergency (non-discretionary) medical expenditures and non-emergency (discretionary) medical expenditures, and (iv) the endogenous distribution of emergency and non-emergency health shocks. I find that low income individuals spend less on their health in early life, leading to their contacting more severe and more frequent health conditions (emergency and non-emergency) following their middle life onwards. This enforces low income individuals to be sicker and to visit emergency rooms more often, while spending more on health cares from their middle life. Moreover, this model shows that this endogenous distribution of health shocks causes low income individuals to have more precautionary savings and less consumption due to their highly volatile earnings from severe health shocks. The poor default more often due to their lower earnings and more frequent emergency (non-discretionary) medical treatments, which arises from their bad health status."

Women have different reasons for choosing an abortion and their social, economic and religious background may influence how they cope. Furthermore, once pregnant, the alternatives of childbirth and adoption or keeping the baby may not be psychologically neutral. Research studies in this area have been hampered by methodological problems, but most of the better-quality studies have shown no increased risk of mental health problems in women having an abortion. A consistent finding has been that of pre-existing mental illness and subsequent mental health problems after either abortion or childbirth. Furthermore, studies have shown that only a minority of women experience any lasting sadness or regret. Risk factors for this include ambivalence about the decision, level of social support and whether or not the pregnancy was originally intended. More robust, definitive research studies are required on mental health after abortion and alternative outcomes such as childbirth."

This was the period after the first world war and the time of the Great Depression. John was 13 at the outbreak of the second world war. He was a very bright boy but his parents were not in a position to fund his further education. However, a bequest of £500 from his grandmother made it possible for him to contemplate going to university, and he obtained a place at St Catherine’s Hall, Oxford, which was not then a college, to study medicine going up at the very young age of 16 in 1942. Like other poor students, he could not have afforded college life and rented rooms in the poorer parts of town. His first year at Oxford was spent studying basic science subjects as, partly owing to the call-up of teachers, he had not done sciences at school. The wartime rationing probably helped him financially as this gave everyone, including poor students, access to subsistence before the days of welfare and student grants.#N##N#At Oxford he became part of a circle of friends including his wife to be, Elizabeth Ross, a fellow medical student. However, she left after one year to do secret work at the wartime code breaking centre of Bletchley Park and, following the end of the war, commenced an acting career. John just managed to eke out his £500 to cover the cost of four years at Oxford, including fees and all his living expenses. By the time he came to the clinical stage of his training, the new student grants had been introduced, which funded his two years at St George’s Hospital Medical School, then at Hyde Park Corner. This was followed …"

The explicit linear dispersion relation for electromagnetic waves propagating along a constant background magnetic field is presented, including an analytical continuation to the whole complex frequency plane for the case of Maxwell-Juttner velocity distribution functions. This dispersion relation is studied numerically for various temperatures. For left-handed solutions, the system presents two branches, the electromagnetic ordinary mode and the Alfven mode. In the low frequency regime, the Alfven branch has two dispersive zones, the normal zone (where ∂ω/∂k > 0) and an anomalous zone (where ∂ω/∂k < 0). We find that in the anomalous zone of the Alfven branch, the electromagnetic waves are damped, and there is a maximum wave number for which the Alfven branch is suppressed. We also study the dependence of the Alfven velocity and effective plasma frequency with the temperature. We complemented the analytical and numerical approaches with relativistic full particle simulations, which consistently agree with the analytical results."

Production of a GFP-Lac repressor hybrid protein in cells carrying F or P1 plasmids tagged with a lac operator array reveals that in smaller (younger) cells these plasmids are seen mainly as a single fluorescent focus at mid-cell, whereas larger cells tend to have two foci, one at each quarter-cell position. Duplication of the central focus is presumed to represent active partition of plasmid copies. We report here our investigation by time-lapse microscopy of the subsequent movement of these copies to the quarter positions. Following duplication of the central focus, the new foci migrated rapidly and directly to their quarter-cell destinations, where they remained until the next cell cycle. The speed of movement was about five times faster than poleward migration of oriC and 50 times faster than cell elongation. Aberrant positioning of mini-F lacking its sopC centromere demonstrated the requirement for the partition system in this localization process. From the measured number of F plasmid copies per cell it appears that each migrating focus contains two or more plasmid molecules. The molecular basis of this clustering, and evidence for phasing of the partition event In the cell cycle, are discussed."

Global DNA methylation levels in the genome are tissue-specific and are reduced in the context of specific developmental and pathological states. Hence accurate assays to quantify global DNA methylation are required. In this review we describe different methods for global DNA methylation measurement and explain the methodology, strengths and limitations of the gold standard assay liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine quantitation. Measurement of global DNA methylation using LC-MS/MS has helped to elucidate the effects of environmental exposures and demethylating drugs that can alter DNA methylation levels and further studies using this technique may provide insights on the prevention and/or reversal of DNA hypomethylation."

At both localities nigerite occurs in quartz-sillimanite rocks associated with pegmatites. Both nigerites can be classified as ‘zinconigerite-6 N 6 S ’, space group R 3̄M m , a = 5.71, c = 55.4 A. In both structures the octahedral M2 site in the T1-layer of the nolanite module is completely occupied by Sn with minor Ti. Charge balance for the tetravalent cations is achieved by partial Li substitution for Al in adjacent octahedral sites (O-layer) sandwiched between two Trlayers. For the first time the presence of essential Li in nigerite-group minerals has been demonstrated by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) yielding 0.61 (6) and 0.70(7) wt.% Li2O for nigerite from Nigeria and Namibia, respectively. Associated gahnite in the Nigerian sample is free of Li2O. Both investigated nigerite-group minerals have tetrahedral Zn: Fe > 1 in the spinel module and are therefore assigned to the zinconigerite subgroup.#N##N#It is suggested that Sn-rich nigerite-group minerals (6 N 6 S and 2 N 1 S polysomes) from rare-element pegmatites or skarns possess essential Li for charge balance whereas low Sn, Ti-bearing nigerites, displaying an extended solid solution with hogbomite, do not require Li for charge balance."

Nevertheless, Australian cities have been actively engaging with low carbon policy for well over a decade and numerous actions and programs have resulted. A question arises as to whether such initiatives can amount to a transition; a systemic change from one dominant fossil-fuel based socio-technical regime, to another, fossil-free based socio-technical regime. In this paper, we review the critical literature on low carbon governance and socio-technical transitions and present a set of criteria by which we propose it is possible to assess the emergence of and/or progress towards low carbon urban transition. We then apply this approach to a case study. The paper presents findings from a review of low carbon initiatives in Australia with a particular focus on Melbourne, Victoria exploring the policy context in which these initiatives and responses have emerged, the typical approaches adopted and the implications for urban change and governance. We examine the roles of, and relationships between, different levels of government, climate change alliances, community/environmental organisations and other actors, and assess progress of the urban low carbon transition. In so doing, we identify significant shortcomings and policy disconnects which we argue are limiting progress towards a low carbon future in Victoria."

One approach for accomplishing this objective is to statistically learn a correlation function for the tests eliminated from a collection of systems that are fully tested (i.e., training data). Accuracy of this correlation function may degrade over the life span of an integrated system however. We describe an adaptive scheme that (1) uses stratified sampling to check the accuracy of a correlation function at various time instances and (2) re-learns a function when its accuracy dips below some tolerable threshold. This methodology is applied to test data from two in-production integrated systems, namely, an accelerometer and a phase-locked loop. Experiments that use over 200,000 real chips demonstrate that the difference between actual function accuracy and its estimate using stratified sampling is smaller than 2%. Moreover, our adaptive re-learning is able to improve the accuracy for one out of three accelerometer and one out of three PLL sampling instances where the function accuracy was unacceptable."

Following Foucault, the paper argues that statistical measurement was to play a key role in establishing 'racial government'. In the Port Phillip District in 1835-40, censuses became a central part of the governmentality used to mark the 'progress' of colonial 'settlement' and to trace out the unsettling of the Aboriginal peoples. The paper locates the impulses to 'protect' the Aborigines and to pursue the colonisation and dispossession of the Aborigines in the first decade of black-white contact by the use of racialised censuses: the authoritative ones which counted only the people who counted, and separate policing censuses that kept count of the 'natives'. In this way the central category, 'the population', apparently both neutral and objective, was available to be used complacently by later empiricist historians to track the development of colonial society and its economy. It could only be used in this way by forgetting that the numbers referred only to those people who counted, and were produced by those people who did the counting."

The technology policies, for instance, R&D programs supported by the government have been playing great roles to develop IT (information and telecommunications) industry and digital economy in Korea. However, in order to be effective, their missions and roles could not be the same as the IT industry grows. Therefore the policies should be carefully designed along with the industrial and technological changes. In this context, this paper analyzes how the roles of national R&D programs of Korea were changed and how accordingly the policy measures of Korea affected the development of IT industry and the infrastructure for the digital economy of Korea."

effective method for material characterization with a scanning acoustic microscope (SAM) is presented. The elastic parameters Young's modulus and bulk modulus and the density are determined from one single reflection signal. In contrast to established methods a calibration specimen is not required. Additionally, the thickness of the specimen can be estimated with two reflection signals at different focus positions. The new method evaluates the parameters of the surface echo, the longitudinal backwall echo and the mode converted transverse wave backwall echo. With estimated material characteristics, a simulation is set up and results are compared to the measured reflection parameters. Accordingly, the material characteristics are iteratively adapted until a minimum error criterion is reached. This approach can deliver results as accurate as the ultrasonic simulation.

Wireless multi-hop networks, in which nodes communicate with each other and convey packets via intermediate nodes without centralized control, have gained increasing attention because of the extension of the wireless communication range associated with such networks. In wireless multi-hop networks, the IEEE 802.11 DCF based on the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) has been commonly used as a Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. IEEE 802.11 DCF is specifically designed for single-hop wireless LANs, which makes quantitative analyses of the contention behaviors occurring at nodes in typical network topologies important. Although several quantitative throughput analyses for wireless multi-hop networks have been reported, few analyses have examined the use of RTS/CTS in IEEE 802.11 DCF multi-hop networks. While RTS/CTS is effective for avoiding packet collisions caused by hidden terminals, an overhead problem occurs due to the increase in the number of RTS/CTS control packets. As the number of RTS/CTS control packets increases, the collisions between RTS/CTS control packets occur more frequently. The analysis of networks that use RTS/CTS has been considered difficult because of the complex behaviors of RTS/CTS. The present paper introduces a novel approach to the analysis of throughput for networks that use RTS/CTS by considering one-way flow in string multi-hop networks. The end-to-end network maximum throughput is obtained by analyzing the maximum throughput of bottleneck nodes. This analysis provides the transmission failure probability considering not only RTS-RTS collisions but also the influence of the Network Allocation Vector (NAV). A simulation is carried out, and a comparison of the analytical and simulated results validates the proposed analytical expressions."

It is based on the frequency domain measurement of the demodulation of luminescence signals. Two lock-in amplifiers are used in the set-up. The ratio of two amplitudes simultaneously measured at different modulation frequencies (f1 and f2) corresponds to the luminescence demodulation and therefore to the decay time. The feasibility of the new method is demonstrated for an optical oxygen sensor. The decay time data obtained from the demodulation measurement are compared with those derived from the conventional phase detection. The well established two-site model for description of intensity calibration curves for oxygen partial pressure, was found to be also suitable to describe the decay time based calibration curves derived from the demodulation and from phase angles. # 2002 Published by Elsevier Science B.V."

Methods  We preserved isolated pig hearts for 24 hours in cold cardioplegia (4° C), using either continuous microperfusion (Group I) or simple storage (Group II), and with a new preservative solution (NPS, groups IA and IIA) vs St. Thomas' solution (groups IB and IIB). The main characteristics of the NPS include (1) prevention of cell swelling with polyethelene glycol (PEG), (2) low calcium and magnesium, and (3) presence of metabolic substrates, such as glucose, insulin, pyruvate, aspartate, alanyl-glutamine, and membrane stabilization compounds such as ethanol and chlorpromazine.  Results  The 4 above groups were compared with hearts harvested and immediately reperfused (control group). During preservation, only Group IB showed significant edema (40% ± 8.4% water gain). Adenylate charge was 25% to 50% higher in microperfused Groups IA and IB (0.678 ± 0.049 and 0.795 ± 0.071, respectively) as compared with simple-storage groups IIA and IIB (0.605 ± 0.048 and 0.524 ± 0.160, respectively). Ultrastructural analysis showed that tissue injury occurred mainly in Group IIB (altered mitochondria, chromatin clumping). Functional data showed better recovery of NPS groups as compared with St. Thomas groups: coronary flow was identical in Group IB and control (57.8 ± 22 and 56.6 ± 14 ml/min/100 g, respectively), and in IA > IB ( p    IIB ( p    IB,  p    IIB,  p    Conclusions  The microperfusion method associated with the NPS provides excellent protection in long-term hypothermic heart preservation."

The comparison with grapevine cultivars from two neighbouring countries was also performed.   Methods and results : Clustering analyses based on the proportion of shared alleles resulted in two clusters containing all accessions except cultivar « Vranec », which was distant from the others. Comparison of genotyping results of Macedonian accessions with 76 Bulgarian and 298 Greek accessions revealed no identical genotypes. In the dendogram, Macedonian accessions are dispersed among Greek and Bulgarian grapevines, suggesting a common genetic background. Additionaly, the synonyms « Smederevka » = « Dimyat » = « Zoumiatiko » and « Belo Zimsko » = « Karatsova Naousis » were also evaluated.   Conclusions : Clustering analyses showed that authentic Macedonian cultivars are distant from two widespread cultivars « Vranec » and « Smederevka ». Comparison of Macedonian cultivars with their synonyms from Greece and Bulgaria revealed differences in allelic profiles at some loci, but further analyses are needed to confirm their unique allelic profiles.   Significance and impact of study : This work is a first step towards the genetic characterization of Macedonian grapevine germplasm, thus contributing to the molecular investigation of grapevine germplasm within the Balkan region."

In this paper we present an analysis of the concept of reciprocity as expressed in English and a way to model it. At a larger structural level the reciprocity model will induce representations and clusters of relations between interpersonal verbs. In particular, we introduce an algorithm that semi-automatically discovers patterns encoding reciprocity based on a set of simple yet effective pronoun templates. Using the most frequently occurring patterns we queried the web and extracted 13,443 reciprocal instances, which represent a broad-coverage resource. Unsupervised clustering procedures are performed to generate meaningful semantic clusters of reciprocal instances. We also present several extensions (along with observations) to these models that incorporate meta-attributes like the verbs' affective value, identify gender differences between participants, consider the textual context of the instances, and automatically discover verbs with certain presuppositions. The pattern discovery procedure yields an accuracy of 97 per cent, while the clustering procedures ??? clustering with pairwise membership and clustering with transitions ??? indicate accuracies of 91 per cent and 64 per cent, respectively. Our affective value clustering can predict an unknown verb's affective value (positive, negative, or neutral) with 51 per cent accuracy, while it can discriminate between positive and negative values with 68 per cent accuracy. The presupposition discovery procedure yields an accuracy of 97 per cent."

These distributions are fitted to soccer data from the English Premier League. An interesting aspect of these data is that the primary variable of interest, the discrete pair shots-for and shots-against, exhibit negative dependence; thus in particular we develop bivariate Poisson-related distributions that allow such dependence. The paper focuses on Archimedian copulas, for which the dependence structure is fully determined by a 1-dimensional projection that is invariant under marginal transformations. Diagnostic plots for copula fit based on this projection are adapted to deal with discrete variables. Covariates relating to within-match contributions such as numbers of passes and tackles are introduced to explain variability in shot outcomes. The results of this analysis would appear to support the notion that playing the “beautiful game” is an effective strategy—more passes and crosses contribute to more effective play and more shots on goal."

Interacting to regulate and maintain physiological functions and immunological tolerance, the microbial community is able to exert an influence on host health. An example of micro-organisms contributing to an intestinal disease state is exhibited by a biodiverse range of protozoan and bacterial species that damage the intestinal epithelia and are therefore implicated in the symptoms of diarrhea. As a contentious exemplar, Blastocystis hominis is a ubiquitous enteric protist that can adversely affect the intestines. The symptoms experienced are a consequence of the responses of the innate immune system triggered by the disruption of the intestinal barrier. The infiltration of the intestinal epithelial barrier involves a host of immune receptors, including toll like receptors and IgM/IgG/IgA antibodies as well as CD8+ T cells, macrophages, and neutrophils. Whilst the mechanisms of interactions between the intestinal microbiome and protozoan parasites remain incompletely understood, it is acknowledged that the intestinal microbiota is a key factor in the pathophysiology of parasitic infections. Modulating the intestinal environment through the administration of probiotics has been postulated as a possible therapeutic agent to control the proliferation of intestinal microbes through their capacity to induce competition for occupation of a common biotype. The ultimate goal of this mechanism is to prevent infections of the like of giardiasis and eliminate its symptoms. The differing types of probiotics (i.e., bacteria and yeast) modulate immunity by stimulating the host immune system. Early animal studies support the potential benefits of probiotic administration to prevent intestinal infections, with human clinical studies showing probiotics can reduce the number of parasites and the severity of symptoms. The early clinical indications endorse probiotics as adjuncts in the pharmaceutical treatment of protozoan infections. Currently, the bar is set low for the conduct of well-designed clinical studies that will translate the use of probiotics to ameliorate protozoan infections, therefore the requisite is for further clinical research."

Yet, they are less prominent as other groups of plants in this global hotspot of biodiversity. Veronica sect. Beccabunga is a common member of the semi-aquatic plants in a variety of moist to aquatic habitats in the region. Species numbers vary between two and fifteen with many subspecies and varieties and taxonomic problems. However, most studies involve only regional floras and no global biosystematic analysis is yet available. Here, we present a morphometric and molecular study based on plastid and nuclear ribosomal DNA of the group to provide a phylogenetic framework for the group using 101 specimens of 24 taxa in the morphometric and 65 specimens for 28 taxa. Further, flow cytometry has been used to reveal the ploidy level, especially of the Egyptian endemic taxa. The analyses demonstrate the division in three subsections but fail to resolve further groups within these subsections consistently. Reasons for this lack of resolution are likely a combination of ancient polymorphisms, hybridization and phenotypic plasticity. Especially, the latter two have been shown to be frequent in the group. The study forms the basis for any further study by demonstrating the necessity to analyze the group globally and/or in more in-depth using highly variable molecular markers."

Increasing fragmentation of media audience raises concerns about its possible effects on democracy. The concerns are that different fragments of the audience will not hear each other and will not talk to each other, which poses a threat to the unity of political community and hampers a constructive discussion on the common matters and consensus based common decisions. However, audience fragmentation is still under-researched empirically. The article uses data from a representative survey conducted after the 2012 Parliamentary elections and asks questions on the pre-election period. Methodologically, the analysis is based on the analysis of audience duplication of different media outlets, as well as network analysis to visualise the duplication of audiences. The article analyses data on the use of different news-oriented media outlets with the largest audience share from all media branches (television, radio, daily newspapers, and internet portals) and calculations of their audience duplication. Although there is no firm point of comparison to assess the extent of fragmentation (e.g. historical data), the data show a considerable overlap of media audiences. Most probably, the fragmentation would be larger in the periphery of the media system, but the analysis of the main media shows a considerable overlap. Therefore, the main conclusion is made that the Lithuanian media audience is not (yet) fragmented. The media that unites the biggest share of the audience is television. Although it is positive that it is still able to connect different fragments, in terms of content it is negative that during the pre-election period it had comparatively little amount of information on election campaign, parties and candidates. However, a very popular media outlet competing with television was the biggest internet news portal, which had a huge amount of information on elections. The article also includes analysis of agenda fragmentation in the audience which revealed the tendency of internet users to have a more fragmented agenda than the part of the audience that doesn’t use the internet. However, in comparison to similar Norwegian data on agenda fragmentation, the agenda of the Lithuanian audience could not be regarded as fragmented. In the future, the analysis of audience fragmentation will be dependent on the collection of comparable data, since it would provide data for comparison and assessing the trends of fragmentation in time. These data would also help to solve some methodological issues that are also discussed in the article, like choice of criteria for assessment and having a point of comparison."

We conducted a mutation analysis by next generation sequencing of 15 genes within the  MS4A  and  TREM  gene clusters; and catalogued rare coding variants detected in a North American data set of 210 cases and 233 controls. Investigation of the 5 homologues genes in the  TREM  locus revealed potentially damaging rare variants in  TREM2 ,  TREML1 ,  TREML2 , and  TREML4 . In agreement with a previous report, we observed a significant enrichment of  TREM2 -damaging missense substitutions in cases (N = 9; 4.2%) compared with controls (N=2; 0.9%;  p  = 0.010; after Yates' correction  p  = 0.022). Among known AD-associated  TREM2  substitutions, we detected p.R47H, p.D87N, and p.H157Y affecting both TREM2 isoforms (NM_018965 and NM_001271821). In addition, we identified 2 cases with novel  TREM2  variants (p.L205P and p.G219C), which mapped only to the isoform NM_001271821 at the C-terminus. Investigation of the  MS4A  gene cluster revealed that potentially damaging missense substitutions and loss-of-function variants were twice as frequent in controls (N = 19; 8.2%) than cases (N = 9; 4.3%), generating a nominally significant result ( p  = 0.047; after Yates' correction  p  = 0.07).

Interestingly, here we reveal an unexpected impairment of slac1 alleles on stomatal opening.#R##N##R##N##R##N#We report that mutations in SLAC1 unexpectedly slow stomatal opening induced by light, low CO2 and elevated air humidity in intact plants and that this is caused by the severely reduced activity of inward K+ (K+in) channels in slac1 guard cells.#R##N##R##N##R##N#Expression of channels and transporters involved in stomatal opening showed small, but significant reductions in transcript levels in slac1 guard cells, however this was deemed insufficient to explain the severely impaired K+in channel activity in slac1.

These experiments showed higher resting [Ca2+]cyt in slac1 guard cells and that reducing [Ca2+]cyt to <10 nM rapidly restored the activity of K+in channels in slac1 closer to wild type levels.#R##N##R##N##R##N#These findings demonstrate an unanticipated compensatory feedback control in plant stomatal regulation, that counteracts the impaired stomatal closing response of slac1, by down-regulating stomatal opening mechanisms and implicates enhanced [Ca2+]cyt sensitivity priming as a mechanistic basis for the down-regulated K+in channel activity.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#Keywords: abscisic acid (ABA), anion channel, Ca2+ signaling, cytosolic Ca2+ concentration, guard cells, potassium uptake channel, SLAC1, stomatal opening#R##N##R##N##R##N#Introduction#R##N#Each stomatal pore in the epidermis of aerial plant tissues is formed by a pair of guard cells. They enable carbon dioxide (CO2) uptake into leaves for photosynthesis and control transpirational water loss to the atmosphere. The aperture of stomatal pores is regulated by guard cell turgor pressure adjusted by modification of guard cell ion and organic solute content (Raschke et al., 1988). Stomata respond to various environmental and endogenous factors, such as light, air humidity, CO2 concentration, abscisic acid (ABA) and cytosolic Ca2+. Elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ functions in ABA-, and CO2-induced stomatal closing (McAinsh et al., 1990; Webb et al., 1996; Grabov & Blatt, 1998; Staxen et al., 1999; MacRobbie, 2000; Allen et al., 2001; Marten et al., 2007a; Young et al., 2006; Siegel et al., 2009; Hubbard et al., 2012).#R##N##R##N#Stomatal opening is driven by the guard cell plasma membrane H+-ATPase, which pumps protons from the guard cell cytosol to the cell wall and creates an electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane (Assmann et al., 1985; Shimazaki et al., 1986; Thiel et al., 1992; for review see Shimazaki et al., 2007). Membrane hyperpolarization triggers the activation of voltage-gated potassium uptake channels (K+in) that mediate the uptake of K+ ions (Schroeder et al., 1984). Guard cell K+in channels function as multimers and single channel gene knockouts do not have apparent stomatal and K+in channel activity phenotypes (Szyroki et al., 2001; Very & Sentenac 2003). However, over-expression of a dominant negative K+in channel mutant (Uozumi et al., 1995) resulted in a slowing and decrease in light-induced stomatal opening by c. 45% (Kwak et al., 2001). Furthermore, even stronger repression of K+in channels in kincless, which is a knockout of KAT2 transformed with a dominant negative version of KAT2, resulted in substantially reduced light-induced stomatal opening (Lebaudy et al., 2008). The activity of K+in channels in guard cells is rapidly down-regulated by [Ca2+]cyt elevation in guard cells (Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1989; Kelly et al., 1995; Grabov and Blatt, 1999). Recent research has shown that ABA enhances the [Ca2+]cyt sensitivity of K+in channel down-regulation in guard cells (Siegel et al., 2009), which is in-line with ABA inhibition of stomatal closing.#R##N##R##N#When plants are subjected to factors causing stomatal closure, slow (S-type) and rapid (R-type) type anion channels are activated (Keller et al., 1989; Schroeder and Hagiwara, 1989; Pei et al., 1997; for review see Barbier-Brygoo et al., 2011; Kollist et al., 2011). Efflux of anions leads to depolarization of the plasma membrane, which in turn activates K+ efflux channels (Schroeder et al., 1987; Blatt and Armstrong, 1993; Roelfsema et al., 2001). A screen for Arabidopsis ozone sensitive mutants (Overmyer et al., 2000; Overmyer et al., 2008, Vahisalu et al., 2008) and CO2-insensitive mutants (Negi et al., 2008) led to the identification of SLAC1, a protein essential for guard cell plasma membrane S-type anion channel function (Vahisalu et al., 2008). SLAC1 is required for stomatal closure induced by ozone, CO2, ABA, calcium, light/dark transitions and reduction in air humidity (Negi et al., 2008; Vahisalu et al., 2008). Mutations in SLAC1 impaired S-type anion channel function, but R-type anion channels and ABA-activated Ca2+-permeable channel activity was not altered (Vahisalu et al., 2008). Furthermore, guard cell protoplasts of slac1 over-accumulated of osmoregulatory ions, such as malate, fumarate, Cl- and K+ (Negi et al., 2008). The plasma membrane localization of SLAC1 and the homology of SLAC1 to anion transporters (Camarasa et al., 2001) suggested that SLAC1 encodes guard cell S-type anion channel (Vahisalu et al., 2008). Heterologous expression of SLAC1 in Xenopus oocytes induced S-type anion currents similar to those observed in guard cells confirming this model (Geiger et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2009).#R##N##R##N#During stomatal opening, SLAC1 must be inactivated (Schroeder et al., 1993; Schwarz et al., 1995; Marten et al., 2007). This implies that stomatal opening should be faster in slac1 plants. However, in complete contrast to this prediction, we found that slac1 exhibited a reduced rate of stomatal opening in response to three physiological stimuli of stomatal opening: light, low CO2 and high humidity in intact plants. Interestingly, although SLAC1 encodes for S-type anion channels, we demonstrate that slac1 alleles exhibit strongly impaired K+in channel activities, which provides a mechanistic basis for slower stomatal opening in slac1 mutants.

NSCLC is the most lethal human cancer due to its high rate of metastasis. Methodology/Principal Findings: Lack of a suitable animal model has so far hampered analysis of metastatic progression. We have examined c-MYC for its ability to induce metastasis in a C-RAF-driven mouse model for non-small-cell lung cancer. c-MYC alone induced frank tumor growth only after long latency at which time secondary mutations in K-Ras or LKB1 were detected reminiscent of human NSCLC. Combination with C-RAF led to immediate acceleration of tumor growth, conversion to papillary epithelial cells and angiogenic switch induction. Moreover, addition of c-MYC was sufficient to induce macrometastasis in liver and lymph nodes with short latency associated with lineage switch events. Thus we have generated the first conditional model for metastasis of NSCLC and identified a gene, c-MYC that is able to orchestrate all steps of this process. Conclusions/Significance: Potential markers for detection of metastasis were identified and validated for diagnosis of human biopsies. These markers may represent targets for future therapeutic intervention as they include genes such as Gata4 that are exclusively expressed during lung development."

Early studies on the optical properties of CNTs in the late 1990s revealed that these materials exhibit high third order susceptibility and a broadband saturable absorption with a sub-picosecond response time. Such ultrafast, highly nonlinear optical response means that they can be employed for noise suppression and for the mode-locking of fiber lasers, and, in addition, their high third order nonlinearity holds great promise for the implementation of various other nonlinear fiber optic devices such as wavelength converters based on four wave mixing. In this review, we discuss the various methods that have been considered for the integration of CNTs in optical systems, highlight the advantages and limitations of using the saturable absorption of carbon nanotubes for the passive mode-locking of fiber lasers and discuss the current status of CNT saturable absorbers in the state of art fiber laser technologies."

The purpose of the current study was to use fMRI to investigate the potential overlap of neural regions engaged during learning and at transfer of learning from the dominant arm to the non-dominant arm during sensorimotor adaptation. Participants performed a visuomotor adaptation joystick task where they adapted manual aiming movements to a 30° rotation of the visual feedback display. They performed eleven blocks (24 trials/block) of right-hand adaptation before performing the task with their left hand (transfer). Participants showed a selective transfer of learning effect: prior right-hand practice led to reduced endpoint errors but not trajectory errors for the left hand. This is consistent with work showing that the right arm is specialized for trajectory control while the left is specialized for endpoint control [Sainburg, R.L., 2005. Handedness, Differential specializations for control of trajectory and position. Exerc Sport Sci Rev 33, 206–213.]. Early adaptation processes were associated with activation in frontal and parietal regions, including bilateral dorsal premotor cortex. At transfer, activation was seen in the temporal cortex as well as the right medial frontal gyrus and the middle occipital gyrus. These regions have been observed in other studies during the late phases of sensorimotor adaptation. Integrating these data with the existing literature, we suggest that the left dorsal premotor cortex contributes to trajectory control, while the left visual and temporal cortices contribute to endpoint control."

One such agent is the dopamine agonist apomorphine, which is already in clinical use, providing symptomatic relief in Parkinson's disease patients. Far from having simple antioxidants properties, apomorphine is described as a pluripotent agent that can also afford neuroprotection through mechanisms independent of its antioxidant actions. It can, for example, salvage dopaminergic receptors and terminals, upregulate expression of neurotrophic factors, limit the rate of neuronal loss by interfering with several steps of apoptotic cascades, reduce excitotoxicity by modulating nitric oxide metabolism, and reve..."

Although the mechanism of nitrite-mediated cytoprotection is unknown, NO is a mediator of the ischemic preconditioning cell-survival program. Analogous to the temporally distinct acute and delayed ischemic preconditioning cytoprotective phenotypes, we report that both acute and delayed (24 h before ischemia) exposure to physiological concentrations of nitrite, given both systemically or orally, potently limits cardiac and hepatic reperfusion injury. This cytoprotection is associated with increases in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Remarkably, isolated mitochondria subjected to 30 min of anoxia followed by reoxygenation were directly protected by nitrite administered both in vitro during anoxia or in vivo 24 h before mitochondrial isolation. Mechanistically, nitrite dose-dependently modifies and inhibits complex I by posttranslational S-nitrosation; this dampens electron transfer and effectively reduces reperfusion reactive oxygen species generation and ameliorates oxidative inactivation of complexes II–IV and aconitase, thus preventing mitochondrial permeability transition pore opening and cytochrome c release. These data suggest that nitrite dynamically modulates mitochondrial resilience to reperfusion injury and may represent an effector of the cell-survival program of ischemic preconditioning and the Mediterranean diet."

P07014, 2007; Preprint available online at http://www.arxiv.org/abs/0807.4457, 2008), in the context of Markovian stochastic interacting particle systems. Finally, we discuss a Gallavotti–Cohen-type symmetry relation with involution map different from time-reversal."

Adaptive response contradicts the linear-non-threshold (LNT) dose-response model for ionizing radiation. We have previously reported that exposure of laboratory animals to radiofrequency radiation can induce a survival adaptive response. Furthermore, we have indicated that pre-exposure of mice to radiofrequency radiation emitted by a GSM mobile phone increased their resistance to a subsequent Escherichia coli infection. In this study, the survival rates in animals receiving both adapting (radiofrequency) and challenge dose (bacteria) and the animals receiving only the challenge dose (bacteria) were 56% and 20%, respectively. In this light, our findings contribute to the assumption that radiofrequency-induced adaptive response can be used as an efficient method for decreasing the risk of infection in immunosuppressed irradiated individuals. The implication of this phenomenon in human’s long term stay in the space is also discussed."

Stiffness and damping characteristics are considered cubic functions of displacement and velocity through the isolator. Analytical results are compared with those obtained by numerical integration in order to validate the closed form solution for strongly nonlinear isolator. While increasing the nonlinearity in the system improves the response of the isolator, stability and jump avoidance conditions set boundary limits for the parameters. The effects of nonlinear parameters to avoid jump phenomenon are discussed in detail. The set of parameters where the system behaves regularly are found and the nonlinear isolator is optimized based on RMS optimization method. Using this method the RMS function of absolute acceleration of the sprung mass is minimized versus the RMS function of relative displacement.Copyright © 2004 by ASME"

Complementary field tests of battery packs in vehicles are also often performed. There are, however, difficulties related to field testing of battery-packs. Some examples are cost issues and the complexity of continuously collecting battery performance data, such as capacity fade and impedance increase. In this paper, a novel field test equipment designed primarily for lithium-ion battery cell testing is presented. This equipment is intended to be used on conventional vehicles, not hybrid vehicles, as a cheaper and faster field testing method for batteries, compared to full scale HEV testing. The equipment emulates an HEV environment for the tested battery cell by using real time vehicle sensor information and the existing starter battery as load and source. In addition to the emulated battery cycling, periodical capacity and pulse testing capability are implemented as well. This paper begins with presenting some background information about hybrid electrical vehicles and describing the limitations with today’s HEV battery testing. Furthermore, the functionality of the test equipment is described in detail and, finally, results from verification of the equipment are presented and discussed."

The effect is based on the combination of a sharp spectral feature with two orthogonallypolarized propagating waveguide modes. We include an experimental proof-of-concept implementation using a silica microsphere coupled to a tapered optical fiber and use a time-domain picture to interpret the observed delays. We also discuss potential applications for future all-optical networks. Increasing bandwidth demands are pushing for the development of all-optical circuitry that will be able to quickly and reliably transmit and process vast amounts of data. Precise control of light propagation, such as the ability to advance, delay, or store a pulse transmitted through a waveguide, is a requisite ingredient for optical data processing in photonic circuits 1. Remarkably, exotic optical phenomena occurring in the presence of strong spectral dispersion such as slow 2 and fast 3 light have been found very useful for achieving these goals, generating a surge of experimental activities aimed at realizing fast or slow light in different media: atomic vapors 2‐4, crystals 5, semiconductors 6,7, and microresonators 8‐11. These demonstrations have shown either fast or slow light for a given configuration. Here we introduce a microresonator-based system that is capable of simultaneously producing time-advanced and time-delayed pulses, including an experimental proof-ofconcept implementation. The ability to simultaneously slow and advance pulses of light brings about a new perspective on photonics: one can easily envision applications involving all-optical processing of data headers and data packets where both fast and slow light may be desirable. Time-advanced signals can be used to compensate time delays inevitable in any complex opticalprocessing network 12. The appeal of strong spectral dispersion is not limited to the linear properties of light: the resulting high optical energy compression may lead to extraordinary enhancement of nonlinear effects and, one day, to"

More recent reports of regional-scale recovery (“regreening”) following the severe droughts of the 1970s and 1980s are sometimes ignored. This study provides a satellite-based evaluation of changes in watershed-scale vegetation conditions in four regions of the Sahel from 1983–2012. Though the results support earlier reports of a “greening” trend, our approach identified strong regional differences in the extent and direction of change, and in the apparent role of woody and herbaceous components in driving the temporal trend."

The sound reducingperformance of the liners is dependent on the acoustic state, defined by e.g. the flow and sound field interacting with the liner. To enable liner optimization the impact of these factors on the liner performance must be predictable. Studies of the impact of these factors were performed with existing experimental, analytical and numerical methods at low Mach number flows and material used in truck engine compartments. The study showed significant impact of both flow and sound field onthe liner performance. The size of the impact of the flow depends on which of the existing methods and models that was used, implying theneed of complementary methods. A new numerical method to model the boundary layer effect was for this reason developed in this work. The method was shown to predict the impact of flow correctly compared to the Pridmore-Brown solution and the method was computationally efficient. The sound reducing performance of a liner exposed to complex sound field and grazing flow can be predicted using existing methods together with the new proposed method. Extra care has to be taken when bulk reacting liners are considered since additional complications compared to locally reacting surfaces occur in presence the of grazing flow."

The forecast is probabilistic to help the decision makers to estimate the weather. In 2007 and 2008 three flooding events on the Brahmaputra River were well predicted 10 days in advance. The medium-range genesis forecast skill of tropical cyclone (TC), a relative small-scale but much destructive weather system, is also explored on examples of super hurricanes Nargis and Marakot. For both hurricanes the maximum winds and minimum center pressure are well predicted. The forecast bias might be due to the global model’s resolution limit or the missing of statistical rendering."

By employing a combination of capital cost indices and search for suitable locations for UPFC a cost function is developed.

Temperature, pH, extraction time, particle size, stirring rate and solvent:flour ratio were identified as the critical factors affecting the extraction process. Preliminary experiments were useful to set the extraction temperature at 55 °C (maximum extractability of β-glucan below gelatinization temperature of starch), and pH close to neutrality. In order to determine the optimal combination of the other four factors, a Taguchi experimental design approach was used: four variables (three levels) in L 9  orthogonal array. Nine different trials were conducted in duplicate for two different waxy barley cultivars: D24 (hulled; 6.02% β-glucan) and H13 (hulless; 4.64% β-glucan). The optimal conditions obtained from the signal to noise ratio analysis were: particle size, 100 μm; solvent:flour ratio equal to 5; stirring rate, 1000 rpm and extraction time, 3 h. The confirmatory experiment conducted with the optimal conditions provided an extraction yield of 73.4 ± 1.2% for D24 and 62.3 ± 1.8% for H13, corresponding to the maximum and showing that these conditions are valid regardless the composition of the used barley."

Human Papillomavirus persistent infection plays an important role on cervical carcinogenesis, mainly by the action of two viral oncoproteins, E6 and E7, which interact with p53 and pRb, respectively. Increasing expression of E6 and E7 in dysplastic cervical cells might thus be reflected by increased expression of p16 INK4a . Recent studies revealed that p16 INK4a  expression could be a marker for dysplastic and neoplastic cervical cells. The aim of this study was to analyze p16 INK4a  expression in cervical preneoplastic and neoplastic lesions and correlate with lesion grade. Expression of p16 INK4a  was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. A total of 6 low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL), 21 high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) and 27 cancer samples were studied. In HPV-positive cervical samples ( n  = 48), p16 INK4a  expression was observed in 1 of 3 LSIL, in 18 of 19 HSIL and in all 26 cancer cases. These results are in accordance with the hypothesis that functional inactivation of pRb by HPV-E7 protein induces p16 INK4a  expression in cervical lesions. In our study, a statistically significant association was observed between cervical lesion grade and p16 INK4a  expression ( P  < 0.001)."

During the 20th century, the cropland base diminished greatly (from ∼ 0.75 ha person−1 in 1900 to ∼ 0.35 ha person−1 in 1990). This loss of croplands was not globally uniform: more than half the world's population, living in developing nations, hlost nearly two-thirds of their per capita cropland base. The distribution of croplands has become increasingly skewed —in 1990, 80% of the population lived off less than 0.35 ha person−1. While agricultural yields have generally increased, they have barely kept pace with population growth in developing nations. Overall, the global food production system is becoming increasingly vulnerable to regional disruptions because of our increasing reliance on expensive technological options to increase agricultural production, or on global food trade."

,"n/a","Memory hierarchy performance, specifically cache memory capacity, is a constraining factor in the performance of modern computers. This paper presents the results of two-level cache memory simulations and examines the impact of exclusive caching on system performance. Exclusive caching enables higher capacity with the same cache area by eliminating redundant copies. The experiments presented compare an exclusive cache hierarchy with an inclusive cache hierarchy utilizing similar L1 and L2 parameters. Experiments indicate that significant performance advantages can be gained for some benchmark through the use of an exclusive organization. The performance differences are illustrated using the L2 cache misses and execution time metrics. The most significant improvement shown is a 16% reduction in execution time, with an average reduction of 8% for the smallest cache configuration tested. With equal size victim buffer and victim cache for exclusive and inclusive cache hierarchies respectively, some benchmarks show increased execution time for exclusive caches because a victim cache can reduce conflict misses significantly while a victim buffer can introduce worst-case penalties. Considering the inconsistent performance improvement, the increased complexity of an exclusive cache hierarchy needs to be justified based upon the specifics of the application and system."

The increase of Fe3+ concentration from 0.20 to 0.60 mmol L−1 at pH 2.5 improved the generation of Fe2+ ions during irradiation of Fe(III)-aquacomplex achieving a maximum of 457 ± 0.68 μmol L−1 after 60 min. However, the increase of pH from 2.5 to 4 decreased the concentration of Fe2+ to 169 ± 0.59 μmol L−1. The presence of Fe(III)-oxalate had a positive effect on antibiotics’ degradation when compared to either Fe(III)-citrate or Fe(III)-aquacomplex complexes. Antibiotic degradation was improved during sunlight irradiation resulting in concentrations of both STZ and SDZ below the detection limit after an UV doses of 43 and 22 J cm−2 UV respectively (80 and 50 min) in the presence of Fe(III)-oxalate."

In contrast to previously studied systems incorporating POR and PDI groups, this alkyne-based derivative shows evidence of throughbond electronic coupling in the ground state; the new chromophore exhibits absorption features similar to those of its constituent parts as well as lower energy features (at wavelengths up to ca. 1000 nm), presumably arising from donor-acceptor interactions. Transient absorption measurements show that excitation at several visible and near-IR wavelengths results in the formation of an excited-state species with a lifetime of 290 ps in 1% (v/v) pyridine in toluene. The absorption spectrum of this species resembles the sum of the spectra for the chemically generated radical cation and radical anion of the chromophore. The chromophore shows moderate two-photon absorption cross sections (2000-7000 GM) at photon wavelengths close to the onset of its lowenergy one-photon absorption feature."

RF presented 33% fat reduction. The increasing amaranth levels darkened crust and crumb of cakes, which decreased color acceptability. Fresh amaranth-containing cakes had similar texture characteristics to the controls, evaluated both instrumentally and sensorially. Sensory evaluation revealed that replacement by 30% amaranth flour decreased C cakes overall acceptability scores, due to its lower specific volume and darker color. Amaranth flour levels had no significant effect on overall acceptability of RF cakes. Hence, the sum of wheat flour and corn starch could be successfully replaced by up to 20% amaranth flour in C and up to 30% in RF pound cakes without negatively affecting sensory quality in fresh cakes.

Evidence is provided that silicate and carbonate minerals are paragenetic, whereas sulfides are xenogenic with respect to diamond. Diamond and paragenetic phases are formed in completely miscible carbonate-silicate growth melts with dissolved elemental carbon. Coherent data of physicochemical experiment and mineralogy of primary inclusions in natural diamonds allows us to prove the mantle-carbonatite theory of diamond origin. The genetic classification of primary inclusions in natural diamonds is based on this theory. The phase diagrams of syngenesis are applicable to interpretation of diamond and syngenetic minerals formation in natural magma sources. They ascertain physicochemical mechanism of natural diamond formation and conditions of entrapment of paragenetic and xenogenic mineral phases by growing diamonds."

Before port's construction, it should define the port market scale which is the foundation for a port in its development and survival from drastic competition. The analysis of port market scale is essential prerequisite and special requirement to a port planning. It is directly related to the success of a port plan on how to make quantitative analysis on port market with scientific theory, model and method and how to determine the reasonable scale of port market in the process of port planning and construction. This paper is an attempt to study these issues, in order to improve the scientific and rationality of the present port market segmentation. The definition of port market is described and main influencing factors of port market segmentation include market factor, port factor and the connection fact are listed at first in this paper. The authors make comparison among the common methods of present port market segmentation such as administrative division method, pivot and ligament method, membership degree method, location quotient method, Wilson Model and so on. On this basis, Wilson Model is mainly applied. Then the authors empirically make analysis on market segmentation methods according to actual situation of the adjacent Tianjin port and Qingdao port. Based on the analysis and study, the Wilson Model can reflect more approximate to the practical market segmentation, which makes the planning of port development more objective and more scientific."

However, the rat is not so often used in complicated neurological studies because of its size of the brain. To investigate the localization of waveform of auditory brainstem responses (ABRs), two rats were examined. Twelve or 13 platinum-rhodium coated electrodes were implanted on the dura mater through the cranial bone. The waveform of ABRs with 6 peaks was clearly recorded. These peaks were comparable with those of the human. However, the latency of these peaks was slightly shorter compared with that of the human. These 6 peaks were clearly identified in the waveform measured on the occipital area. On the other hand, these peaks recorded in frontal region were fused together. From these results, electrodes should be placed on the occipital area of the cranial bone to identify these peaks originated from brainstem by the auditory stimulation. Therefore, it is expected that latency changes can be evaluated clearly. This measurement system has a new possibility to analyze the details of various kinds of evoked potentials waveforms."

Specifically, we focus on spatially flat, low matter density models with adiabatic Gaussian initial conditions. The spatial flatness is achieved with an additional quintessence component whose equation of state parameter w eff  is taken to be independent of redshift. Throughout most of the paper we do not allow any massive neutrino contribution and also the influence of the gravitational waves on the CMB is taken to be negligible. The analysis is carried out separately for two cases: (i) using the acoustic scale measurements as presented in Hiitsi (2006, A&A, 449, 891), (ii) using the full SDSS LRG power spectrum and its covariance matrix. We are able to obtain a very tight constraint on the Hubble constant: H 0  = 70.8 +2.1  -2.0  km s -1  Mpc -1 , which helps in breaking several degeneracies between the parameters and allows us to determine the low redshift expansion law with much higher accuracy than available from the WMAP + HST data alone. The positive deceleration parameter q 0  is found to be ruled out at 5.5σ confidence level. Finally, we extend our analysis by investigating the effects of relaxing the assumption of spatial flatness and also allow for a contribution from massive neutrinos."

Classical risk scores are not suitable as risk estimates of CVD in this young population. Recent recommendations from the American Heart Association are aimed to improve cardiovascular health (CVH).    Objectives  Examining CVH by Health Life Check (HLC) ( http://mylifecheck.heart.org/ ) in previously severe preeclamptic women is part of our cardiovascular risk follow-up program. Final score is a scale from 1 to 10, where 10 represents ideal CVH.    Results  Since 2011 HLC is offered to all women in this program. So far, 213 women were included, 148 (70%) underwent a CVH assessment by performing HLC between three months and one year after delivery. The overall HLC score was 7.4 (median; range: 0.8–10.0) at 3.6 months after the delivery. Only 2 out of 148 women (1.4%) had an ideal score. HLC score was 7.1 (median; range: 0.8–10.0) for 48 women who had a HLC score within 6 months after delivery versus 8.2 (median; range: 2.6–9.8) in the second half of the first year after delivery.    Conclusion  These are the first data on CVH in women after severe preeclampsia. Only 1.4% of these women had an ideal score. Active counselling of these women could be the reason of the improved score over time. We showed that CVH as assessed by HLC is an excellent tool for cardiovascular risk management in this specific group of women."

Very often, hyperbolic PDE can be derived directly from first principles in physics, such as the conservation of mass, momentum and energy. These principles are universally accepted to be valid and can be used for the simulation of a very wide class of different problems, ranging from astrophysics (rotating gas clouds, the merger of a binary neutron star system into a black hole and the associated generation and propagation of gravitational waves) over geophysics (generation and propagation of seismic waves after an earthquake, landslides, avalanches, tidal waves, storm surges, flooding and morphodynamics of rivers) to engineering (turbulent flows over aircraft and the associated noise generation and propagation, rotating flows in turbo-machinery, multi-phase liquid-gas flows in internal combustion engines) and computational biology (blood flow in the human cardio-vascular system).It is of course impossible to cover all the above topics in a single special issue. However, all these apparently different applications have a common mathematical description under the form of nonlinear hyperbolic systems of partial differential equations, possibly containing also higher order derivative terms, non-conservative products and nonlinear (potentially stiff) source terms. From the mathematical point of view, the major difficulties in these systems arise due to the inherent nonlinearities and the formation of non-smooth solution features such as e.g. shock waves. The construction of robust and accurate numerical methods for such type of problems is even after decades of successful research an ongoing quest. This quest is fueled by recent advances in the development of novel methods with promising additional properties such as e.g. high spatial order on unstructured meshes, algorithmic simplicity for modern multi-core architectures and automatic mesh and/or trial function adaptation. The final goal is to construct methods that efficiently produce reliable results for such type of problems.This special issue is dedicated to recent advances in numerical methods for such nonlinear systems of hyperbolic PDE and tries to cover a wide spectrum of different problems and numerical approaches."

Insulin resistance (IR) is a prominent pathophysiologic component in a myriad of metabolic disorders, including obesity, prediabetes, and type 2 diabetes mellitus, which are common in our locality. The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of IR and factors associated with this condition in an adult population from Maracaibo city, Venezuela. Methodology. A cross-sectional, descriptive study with multistaged randomized sampling was carried out in 2026 adults. IR was defined as HOMA2-IR ≥ 2. A multiple logistic regression model was constructed in order to evaluate factors associated with IR. Results. The prevalence of IR was 46.5% (), with 46.7% () in the general population, 46.4% () in females, and 47.90% () in males (). IR prevalence tended to increase with age and was significantly greater in subjects aged ≥30 years (; ). Employment, alcohol consumption, obesity, high triacylglycerides, low HDL-C, and dysglycemia were associated with greater odds of IR, whereas a high level of physical activity appeared to be weak protective factor against IR. Conclusions. The prevalence of IR is elevated in our locality. The main determinants of this condition appear to be the presence of obesity, high triacylglycerides, low HDL-C, dysglycemia, and alcohol intake."

However, the large mode area required in high power fiber lasers and amplifiers causes several new difficulties in fiber and component design and in fusion assembly methods. Mode transformation technology allows optimization of the design of the gain fibers with independent control of the characteristics of the input and output beams. The quality of the output beam is decoupled from the mode shape in the gain fiber. Even with the desired signal properties, the high optical powers and multimode pump operation cause new issues with reliability of the fused fibers and components.

To show the noninferiority of the low-molecular-weight heparin certoparin to unfractionated heparin (UFH) for the prevention of thromboembolic complications, we performed a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled multicenter trial in patients with acute ischemic stroke.#N##N#Methods— Overall, 545 patients were randomized within 24 hours of stroke onset to treatment with certoparin (3000 U anti-Xa OD; n=272) or UFH (5000 U TID; n=273) for 12 to 16 days. Patients with paresis of a leg and an National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score of 4 to 30 points were included. The primary end point was a composite outcome of proximal deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, or death related to venous thromboembolism during treatment. Computed tomography was performed at trial entry, after 7 days, and when clinical deterioration occurred.#N##N#Results— The per-protocol analysis revealed 17 (7.0%) primary events in the certoparin group compared with 24 (9.7%) in the UFH group, thereby demonstrating noninferiority ( P =0.0011), confirmed by intention-to-treat analysis (6.6% versus 8.8%; P =0.008). Major bleeding occurred during treatment in 3 patients allocated to certoparin (1.1%) and 5 patients allocated to UFH (1.8%).#N##N#Conclusions— Certoparin (3000 U anti-Xa OD) is at least as effective and safe as UFH (TID) for the prevention of thromboembolic complications in patients with acute ischemic stroke."

Such contests offer an opportunity to bring the excitement and challenges of protocol design---one of the core intellectual elements of research and practice in networked systems---to a broader group of potential contributors, whose ideas may prove important. Moreover, it may lead to an increase in the number of students, especially undergraduates or those learning via online courses, interested in pursuing a career in the field.   We describe the creation of the infrastructure and our experience with a protocol design contest conducted in MIT's graduate Computer Networks class. This contest involved the design and evaluation of a congestion-control protocol for paths traversing cellular wireless networks. One key to the success of a design contest is an unambiguous, measurable objective to compare protocols. In practice, protocol design is the art of trading off conflicting goals with each other, but in this contest, we specified that the goal was to maximize $\log(\mbox{throughput}/\mbox{delay})$. This goal is a good match for applications such as video streaming or videoconferencing that care about high throughput and low interactive delays.   Some students produced protocols whose performance was better than published protocols tackling similar goals. Furthermore, the convex hull of the set of all student protocols traced out a tradeoff curve in the throughput-delay space, providing useful insights into the entire space of possible protocols. We found that student protocols diverged in performance between the training and testing traces, indicating that some students had overtrained ('overfitted') their protocols to the training trace. Our conclusion is that, if designed properly, such contests could benefit networking research by making new proposals more easily reproducible and amenable to such 'gamification,' improve networked systems, and provide an avenue for outreach."

TF17. Methods: The crude esterase was purified by using acetone precipitation and ion exchange choromatography methods and characterized. Results: The optimum temperature and pH of the enzyme were found to be 50°C and 7.5, respectively. The purified enzyme was extremely stable in the range of pH 4.0-9.0 after 72 hour incubation at 4°C. The thermal stability profile shows that this enzyme is stable in the range of 30-50°C after 72 h incubation. The Km and Vmax values for this esterase in the presence of p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) as substrate were found as 0.056 mM and 19.38 U/mg protein, respectively. The enzyme activity was inhibited more than about 60% in the presence of some organic solvents such as isopropanol and acetonitrile. Additionally, it was detected that some metal ions affect the enzyme activity at different ratio. Conclusion: An esterase was purified and characterized from Geobacillus sp. TF17. The pH and thermal stability of purified enzyme are quite high. The data obtained from this study show that the purified esterase has advantages for industrial or biotechnological applications in terms of especially its high thermal- and pH-stability."

To illustrate the phenomenon, quantiles of height, body mass index (BMI), and plasma lipids and lipoproteins were compared to genetic risk scores (GRS) derived from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP)s having established genome-wide significance: 180 SNPs for height, 32 for BMI, 37 for low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, 47 for high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, 52 for total cholesterol, and 31 for triglycerides in 1930 subjects. Both phenotypes and GRSs were adjusted for sex, age, study, and smoking status. Quantile regression showed that the slope of the genotype-phenotype relationships increased with the percentile of BMI (P = 0.002), LDL-cholesterol (P = 3×10−8), HDL-cholesterol (P = 5×10−6), total cholesterol (P = 2.5×10−6), and triglyceride distribution (P = 7.5×10−6), but not height (P = 0.09). Compared to a GRS's phenotypic effect at the 10th population percentile, its effect at the 90th percentile was 4.2-fold greater for BMI, 4.9-fold greater for LDL-cholesterol, 1.9-fold greater for HDL-cholesterol, 3.1-fold greater for total cholesterol, and 3.3-fold greater for triglycerides. Moreover, the effect of the rs1558902 (FTO) risk allele was 6.7-fold greater at the 90th than the 10th percentile of the BMI distribution, and that of the rs3764261 (CETP) risk allele was 2.4-fold greater at the 90th than the 10th percentile of the HDL-cholesterol distribution. Conceptually, it maybe useful to distinguish environmental effects on the phenotype that in turn alters a gene's phenotypic expression (quantile-dependent penetrance) from environmental effects affecting the gene's phenotypic expression directly (gene-environment interaction)."

Weil for studying classical theta functions. First we translate in knot theoretic language classical theta functions, the action of the finite Heisenberg group, and the discrete Fourier transform. Then we explain how the non-abelian counterparts of these arise in the framework of the quantum group quantization of the moduli space of flat $SU(2)$-connections on a surface, in the guise of the non-abelian theta functions, the action of a skein algebra, and the Reshetikhin-Turaev representation of the mapping class group. We prove a Stone-von Neumann theorem on the moduli space of flat $SU(2)$-connections on the torus, and using it we deduce the existence and the formula for the Reshetikhin-Turaev representation on the torus from quantum mechanical considerations. We show how one can derive in a quantum mechanical setting the skein that allows handle slides, which is the main ingredient in the construction of quantum $3$-manifold invariants."

After presenting a systematic introduction to these notions, in this paper we work in the class of least adversarial power, which is relevant for assessing setups operated by trusted experimentalists, and compare three levels of characterization of the devices. Many recent studies have focused on the so-called ?device-independent? level, in which a lower bound on the amount of intrinsic randomness can be certified without any characterization. The other extreme is the case when all the devices are fully characterized: this ?tomographic? level has been known for a long time. We present for this case a systematic and efficient approach to quantifying the amount of intrinsic randomness, and show that setups involving ancillas (positive-operator valued measures, pointer measurements) may not be interesting here, insofar as one may extract randomness from the ancilla rather than from the system under study. Finally, we study how much randomness can be obtained in presence of an intermediate level of characterization related to the task of ?steering?, in which Bob?s device is fully characterized while Alice?s is a black box. We obtain our results here by adapting the NPA hierarchy of semidefinite programs to the steering scenario.This article is part of a special issue of Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical devoted to ?50 years of Bell?s theorem?."

The complete description of the wind action would require the knowledge of some joint probability density functions (JPDFs) of the load components and in particular of their extreme values. In order to estimate these JPDFs from the marginal distributions of the variables a copula-based approach is introduced. Copula is a mathematical tool already quite common in some engineering branches but practically unexplored in wind engineering. This approach is extremely useful to estimate the JPDFs of extreme values also when experimental load time histories are available, as generally they are not long enough to do it. Similarly, if a Monte Carlo approach is followed, the estimate based on the copula allows to reduce significantly the number of simulations to be performed. In this paper the copula-based approach is applied to experimental data measured in the wind tunnel for a rigid tall building, in order to determine the wind load combination coefficients focusing on a generic effect given by the linear combination of two load components. The influence of the resonant part of the structural response is neglected. The method is validated against the extreme values determined directly on the linear combination of the time histories. Two examples are discussed, considering almost uncorrelated and fairly correlated wind loads, and two different copulas are employed."

More recently, queer activism and scholarship have largely focused on contesting the emergence of homonormative forms of nationalism and institutionalized rights-based LGBT politics. However, to define a political intervention as queer on the condition that it explicitly adheres to one or other specific political project is possibly to overstate the case. The ‘queer signifier’ has travelled far beyond its local origins and, as a consequence, has shifted meanings in significant ways. In this essay, I consider current tensions concerning what it means to be politically queer, focusing on queer responses to the formation of sexual rights-bearing subjects, and critically analyse the notion of sexual rights on which contemporary international mainstream sexual politics is based. Through this analysis I aim to draw attention to the entanglement of the normalization of sexual identities at a national level with current sexual neocolonial projects. Since the signifier ‘queer’ has spread in many different directions, I argue that it is precisely cultural translation that makes key alliances against both universalist and nationalist queer positions possible."

Proteomic analyses of LDs have consistently identified the small GTPase Rab18 as a component of the LD coat. However, the specific contribution of Rab18 to adipocyte function remains to be elucidated. Herein, we have analyzed Rab18 expression, intracellular localization and function in relation to the metabolic status of adipocytes. We show that Rab18 production increases during adipogenic differentiation of 3T3-L1 cells. In addition, our data show that insulin induces, via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K), the recruitment of Rab18 to the surface of LDs. Furthermore, Rab18 overexpression increased basal lipogenesis and Rab18 silencing impaired the lipogenic response to insulin, thereby suggesting that this GTPase promotes fat accumulation in adipocytes. On the other hand, studies of the β-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol confirmed and extended previous evidence for the participation of Rab18 in lipolysis. Together, our data support the view that Rab18 is a common mediator of lipolysis and lipogenesis and suggests that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the link that enables Rab18 action on these two processes. Finally, we describe, for the first time, the presence of Rab18 in human adipose tissue, wherein the expression of this GTPase exhibits sex- and depot-specific differences and is correlated to obesity. Taken together, these findings indicate that Rab18 is involved in insulin-mediated lipogenesis, as well as in β-adrenergic-induced lipolysis, likely facilitating interaction of LDs with ER membranes and the exchange of lipids between these compartments. A role for Rab18 in the regulation of adipocyte biology under both normal and pathological conditions is proposed."

We conducted a secondary analysis of self-report and video-recorded data from a prior study of clinical interactions between 112 low-income, Black patients and their 14 non-Black physicians at a primary care clinic in the Midwestern United States between June, 2006 and February, 2008. Overall, physicians talked more than patients; however, both physician bias and patient perceived past discrimination affected physician–patient talk time ratio. Non-Black physicians with higher levels of implicit, but not explicit, racial bias had larger physician–patient talk time ratios than did physicians with lower levels of implicit bias, indicating that physicians with more negative implicit racial attitudes talked more than physicians with less negative racial attitudes. Additionally, Black patients with higher levels of perceived discrimination had smaller physician–patient talk time ratios, indicating that patients with more negative racial attitudes talked more than patients with less negative racial attitudes. Finally, smaller physician–patient talk time ratios were associated with less patient subsequent adherence, indicating that patients who talked more during the racially discordant medical interactions were less likely to adhere subsequently.

This process, referred to as “Fe-loss”, can operate during natural pre-eruptive cooling of host magma and results in lower FeOt and higher MgO contents within the initially trapped volume of inclusion. The extent of Fe-loss is enhanced by large temperature intervals of magma cooling before eruption. The compositions of homogenised melt inclusions in olivine phenocrysts from several subduction-related suites demonstrate that (1) Fe-loss is a common process, (2) the maximum observed degree of re-equilibration varies between suites, and (3) within a single sample, variable degrees of re-equilibration can be recorded by melt inclusions trapped in olivine phenocrysts of identical composition. Our modelling also demonstrates that the re-equilibration process is fast going to completion, in the largest inclusions in the most magnesian phenocrysts it is completed within 2 years. The results we obtained indicate that the possibility of Fe-loss must be considered when estimating compositions of parental subduction-related magmas from naturally quenched glassy melt inclusions in magnesian olivine phenocrysts. Compositions calculated from glassy inclusions affected by Fe-loss will inherit not only erroneously low FeOt contents, but also low MgO due to the inherited higher Mg##of the residual melt in re-equilibrated inclusions. We also demonstrate that due to the higher MgO contents of homogenised melt inclusions affected by Fe-loss, homogenisation temperatures achieved in heating experiments will be higher than original trapping temperatures. The extent of overheating will increase depending on the degree of re-equilibration, and can reach up to 50 °C in cases where complete re-equilibration occurs over a cooling interval of 200 °C."

In this paper, a recursive spectral similarity measure-based band selection (RSSM-BBS) method is presented. Unlike most of the existing image-based band selection techniques, it is for two hyperspectral signatures with its main focus on their spectral separability. Furthermore, it is unsupervised and based on the recursive calculation of the spectral similarity measure with an additional band. In order to demonstrate the utility of the proposed method, an anomaly detection algorithm is developed, which first extracts the anomalous target spectrum from the image using the automatic target detection and classification algorithm (ATDCA), followed by the maximum spectral screening (MSS) to obtain a good estimate of the background, and then implements RSSM-BBS to select bands that participate in the subsequent adaptive cosine/coherence estimator (ACE) target detection. As shown in the experimental result on the AVIRIS dataset, the detection performance of the ACE has been improved greatly with the bands selected by RSSM-BBS over that using full bands."

The Residual formaldehyde in the adhesive gets released during the course of the life of the panel products. The emission of formaldehyde from panels bonded with Urea Formaldehyde resin adhesive has been receiving increasing concern in recent years as it is reported to be a health hazard. At international level, there is lot of restriction on use of panel products which releases formaldehyde above certain levels prescribed by the world health organization. However, in India not much importance was given on these aspects until 2007. Increased public awareness and the consumer demand for non-hazardous products have now resulted as a driving force for the panel industries in India to develop E1 formaldehyde emission class panel products. Facilities have also been established to determine the formaldehyde release from panel products as per European standards. Keeping in view the harmful effect on the end users and environment considerations, studies have been made to develop amino resin system using suitable scavengers that could mop up the free formaldehyde during the resin preparation."

The work conducted is focussing on the suitability of multi‐temporal aerial photographs and satellite images for the detection of minefields together with ancillary (conflict) information. Analysis of the images acquired showed that, even at lower spatial resolutions, but through the use of multi-temporal images, important minefield related indicators could be identified, providing important information for the mine action process. For validation of the interpretations use was made of a minefield map book that was available for these border minefields."

Perry posits that intellectual development proceeds from a basic dualism through nine stages ('positions') and culminates with a sense of personal identify and commitment. Perry suggests that the college years act as the agent of intellectual development, but others have argued that Perry's scheme is not flexible enough to account for gender- and culture-based differences. This study uses a paper-and-pencil questionnaire to describe developmental characteristics of gifted high school students and examines between-group differences between gender and ethnic groups at the high school sophomore and senior years. All groups showed significant improvement from sophomore to senior year. There were no differences by gender or ethnicity at the sophomore year, but by senior year, significant developmental differences existed among ethnic groups."

The theory is based on a mathematically rigorous asymptotic analysis of the second variation of 3D, fully nonlinear elastic energy, as the shell’s thickness goes to zero. Our main results are a rigorous proof of the classical formula for buckling load and the explicit expressions for the relative amplitudes of displacement components in single Fourier harmonics buckling modes, whose wave numbers are described by Koiter’s circle.

A gene encoding a regulator of carotenoid biosynthesis was identified by studying mutant strains carrying a transcriptional fusion to PB and deletions in three candidate genes. Our results prove that the identified gene, named carA, codes for a repressor of the PB promoter in the dark. They also show that the carA gene product does not participate in the light activation of two other promoters connected with carotenoid synthesis or its regulation in M. xanthus. CarA is a novel protein consisting of a DNA-binding domain of the family of MerR helix-turn-helix transcriptional regulators, directly joined to a cobalamin-binding domain. In support of this, we report here that the presence of vitamin B12 or some other cobalamin derivatives is absolutely required for activation of the PB promoter by light."

The objective was to investigate the effect of state of stresses and fluid flow on the mechanism of sanding, and the development of the failure zone around the borehole. The experiments were conducted on 100×100×100 mm 3  cubic samples of synthetic sandstones. The samples were prepared based on an established procedure developed to produce weakly consolidated sandstone samples with identical physico-mechanical properties. The properties of the synthetic sandstone samples were determined by conducting a series of standard rock mechanics tests on cylindrical plugs. Using a true-triaxial stress cell (TTSC), cubic samples were subjected to true-triaxial stresses and radial fluid flow from the outer boundaries into the borehole. The maximum and intermediate principal stresses were applied laterally in both cases while the effect of changing the lateral stresses on the development of the failure zone around borehole was monitored. It was observed that the geometry (i.e. width and depth) of the failure zone developed around the borehole is a function of the lateral stresses ratio (i.e. lateral stress anisotropy). The experiments were also simulated numerically using ABAQUS in order to validate and interpret the results from the experiments. A good agreement was obtained between the results of both methods, which confirms the importance of lateral stress anisotropy on the evolution of sanding. The observations and results of these experiments and numerical simulations will be presented and discussed."

In principle, SC is operated at a triple-point condition, in which the liquid mixture is simultaneously vaporized and crystallized due to the three-phase equilibrium.

Therefore, it is critically important to keep the PDB data, as much as possible, error-free. In this study, we have analyzed PDB crystal structures possessing oligonucleotide/ oligosaccharide binding (OB)-fold, one of the highly populated folds, for the presence of sequence-structure mapping errors. Using energy-based structure quality assessment coupled with sequence analyses, we have found that there are at least five OB-structures in the PDB that have regions where sequences have been incorrectly mapped onto the structure. We have demonstrated that the combination of these computation techniques is effective not only in detecting sequence-structure mapping errors, but also in providing guidance to correct them. Namely, we have used results of computational analysis to direct a revision of X-ray data for one of the PDB entries containing a fairly inconspicuous sequence-structure mapping error. The revised structure has been deposited with the PDB. We suggest use of computational energy assessment and sequence analysis techniques to facilitate structure determination when homologs having known structure are available to use as a reference. Such computational analysis may be useful in either guiding the sequence-structure assignment process or verifying the sequence mapping within poorly defined regions."

In this study, it was aimed to investigate the relationship of symptoms of IDA and zinc deficiency in adult IDA patients. The study included 43 IDA patients and 43 healthy control subjects. All patients were asked to provide a detailed history and were subjected to a physical examination. The hematological parameters evaluated included hemoglobin (Hb); hematocrit (Ht); red blood cell (erythrocyte) count (RBC); and red cell indices mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (МСН), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (МСНС), and red cell distribution width (RDW). Anemia was defined according to the criteria defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). Serum zinc levels were measured in the flame unit of atomic absorption spectrophotometer. Symptoms attributed to iron deficiency or depletion, defined as fatigue, cardiopulmonary symptoms, mental manifestations, epithelial manifestations, and neuromuscular symptoms, were also recorded and categorized. Serum zinc levels were lower in anemic patients (103.51 ± 34.64 μ/dL) than in the control subjects (256.92 ± 88.54 μ/dL;   100 μ/dL. When the serum zinc level was compared with pica, no statistically significant correlation was found (p = 0.742). Zinc is a trace element that functions in several processes in the body, and zinc deficiency aggravates IDA symptoms. Measurement of zinc levels and supplementation if necessary should be considered for IDA patients."

Only males can sing. The brain nuclei controlling song learning and production in males are considerably larger than in females. The robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) is a premotor nucleus, playing a key role in controlling singing. RA receives denser synapse inputs in males than in females. Sex differences of excitatory synaptic transmission in the RA projection neurons (PNs) have not been reported. In the present study, using whole-cell voltage-clamp recording, spontaneous EPSCs (sEPSCs) and miniature EPSCs (mEPSCs) of RA PNs in the intact males and females were recorded. The average frequency and amplitude of sEPSCs/mEPSCs in the intact males were higher than females. The half-width and decay time of sEPSCs/mEPSCs in the intact males were longer than females. In order to verify whether these sex differences related to sex steroids, males were castrated. The average frequency of sEPSCs/mEPSCs in castrated males was lower than intact males and was similar to in females; the amplitude was not changed after castrating. These results demonstrate the sexually dimorphic of the excitatory synaptic transmission in the RA PNs, the RA PNs in males receive more excitatory synaptic transmission and these sex differences were partly affected by sex hormones. These findings contribute to further illuminate the neural mechanisms under the sexually dimorphism in song production of adult zebra finches."

However, in vivo liver tumors are usually three-dimensional and multicellular. The purpose of this study was therefore to determine the effect of ethanol in multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) as a model system in vitro. Methods: After the application of 1 mM ethanol for 24 h and 48 h, viable, apoptotic and necrotic cells within MCTS were stained with specific fluorescent dyes, and their amount and distribution within the MCTS were assessed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. To evaluate the effect on HepG2 cell migration and cell proliferation, the outgrowth potential after 1 week in culture was evaluated. Results: As assessed by YO-PRO-1 staining, ethanol increased the number of apoptotic cells from 21.5 units (U) in control spheroids to 364 U and 482.2 U after 24 h and 48 h in ethanol-treated spheroids, respectively (P < 0.001). Merocyanine staining fluorescence increased from 10.7 U in the control to 122 U after 24 h and 293.2 U after 48 h (P < 0.001). Cell viability, as determined by staining with the acetoxymethyl ester of calcein, decreased from 578.5 U in the control to 236 U and 73.4 U after 24 h and 48 h of ethanol exposure respectively (P < 0.001). Necrosis showed an increase from 2 U in control to 24.9 after 24 h and 54 U after 48 h. MCTS treated with ethanol showed almost complete inhibition of outgrowth potential after 1 week in culture, compared to controls (P < 0.005). Conclusions: Small concentrations of ethanol (1 mM) induced apoptosis in HepG2 MCTS with a concomitant inhibition on outgrowth potential, accompanied with a low degree of necrosis. These findings suggest that low concentrations of ethanol may already be sufficient for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma."

Transgenic mice were generated using the keratin-14 promoter/enhancer to direct expression of wild-type human CXCR2 (K14hCXCR2 WT) or mutant CXCR2, in which the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) was truncated at Ser 331 and the dileucine AP-2 binding motif was mutated to alanine (K14hCXCR2 331T/LL/AA/IL/AA). Our results indicate that K14hCXCR2WT transgenic mice exhibited a normal phenotype, while K14hCXCR2 331T/LL/AA/IL/AA transgenic mice were born with tails of normal length, but three to eight days after birth their tails degenerated, leaving only a short tail stub. The tissue degeneration in the tail started between caudal somites with degeneration of bone and connective tissue distal to the constriction, which was replaced with stromal tissue heavily infiltrated with inflammatory cells. The tail lesion site revealed coagulation in enlarged vessels and marked edema that eventually led to loss of the distal tail. Moreover, 66% of the mice exhibited focal skin blemishes and inflammation that exhibited an increase in the number of sebaceous glands and blood vessels, enlargement of the hair follicles due to increased number of keratinocytes, reduction in the connective tissue content, and a thickening of the epidermis. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining of the epidermis from tail tissue in the transgenic mice indicated a loss of the cell adhesion markers E-cadherin and desmoplakin. These data suggest that keratinocyte expression of a CTD mutant of CXCR2 has effects on homeostasis of the connective tissue in the tail, as well as the maintenance of the epidermis and its appendages."

We hypothesized that shoulder function and performance status measured by the KJOC score among active Minor League professional baseball pitchers were high at pre-participation and that the pitchers who had not been previously treated for a shoulder injury and were playing without arm trouble had significantly higher KJOC scores than their counterparts.  Methods  In this cross-sectional survey, data on pre-participation KJOC scores, along with other study measures, were collected from a cohort of Minor League professional baseball pitchers. Generalized estimating equations with a Poisson distribution were used for analysis.  Results  A total of 366 Minor League professional pitchers were included, with a mean KJOC score of 92.8 points (SD, 12.1 points), suggesting that participating pitchers' shoulder function and performance were high. Participating pitchers who had not received treatment for a shoulder injury had significantly higher KJOC scores than those who had received treatment, either surgical or nonsurgical (β = 0.0238,  P  = .0495). In addition, pitchers who were not currently injured, were playing without arm trouble, or had not missed games in the past 12 months because of a shoulder injury also had statistically significantly higher KJOC scores than their counterparts.  Conclusion  This study provides an empirical profile of the KJOC score for a large sample of active Minor League professional baseball pitchers and identifies risk factors associated with decreased KJOC scores."

Main predictor: baseline socioeconomic position measured according to wealth. Outcomes and predictors were measured at each of the five follow-up interviews. Unadjusted and adjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated through 2-year lagged Poisson regression in generalized estimating equation models, adjusted for sociodemographic, lifestyle, quality-of-life, and health variables.#R##N#Results: Between any two consecutive waves, 1,656 (20.3%) participants developed some IADL impairment.

A new class of solutions is found which represent global vortices of the internal spin field. These spin vortices are characterized by a non-vanishing angular dependence at spatial infinity, or winding. We show that despite the topological     Z    2     behavior of   S  O   (  3  )    windings, the topological charge of the spin vortices is of the   Z   type in the cholesteric. We find these solutions numerically and discuss the properties derived from their low energy effective field theory in   1  +  1   dimensions."

We investigated 36 German families suffering from hereditary ataxias for the SCA1 mutation and elaborated clinical and neurophysiological characteristics. SCA1 accounts for 10 - 15% of dominant cerebellar ataxias in German kindreds. The clinical presentation is characterized by broad, even intrafamilial variability and multiple system involvement already in early stages. Slowed saccades, ptosis and facial weakness are more prevalent in SCA1 but were unspecific differences compared to non-SCA1 ataxias. Two electrophysiological parameters characterize SCA1 : markedly prolonged central motor conduction time in motor evoked potentials and predominantly demyelinating polyneuropathy. Molecular genetic analyses are indispensable to diagnose SCA patients precisely. Extensive neurophysiological studies are recommendable in the clinical approach as they are suitable to discover subclinical damage of the nervous system. In contrast to the enormous variability of clinical signs in SCA1 neurophysiological findings are rather constant."

In the study, feedback control based on independent modal space control is first used to assign the pole of the system under detection intentionally. Then the prescribed characteristic frequencies of the structure under control, which may be more sensitive to damage, are obtained and further employed to constitute a sensitivity-enhanced damage indicator (SEDI). The principle of sensitivity-enhancing feedback control for damage detection of multi-degree-of-freedom systems is elaborated. To overcome the effect of measurement noise on modal frequencies, a hypothesis test involving the t-test that utilizes the SEDI is employed to estimate the occurrence of damage, while a statistical pattern recognition method that uses the feature vectors including the SEDI is employed to locate damage. Based on the perturbation theory, the feature vectors are normalized in order to eliminate the effect of damage extent on damage localization. The proposed method is verified by examples including a three-span continuous beam with a single damaged element and the IASC-ASCE benchmark structure with a single damaged brace. Simulation results show that, by using the frequencies of the structures under control, the proposed damage indicators are more sensitive to damage and are capable of detecting and locating small damage of structures."

In comparison with ascorbic acid alone, all steroid hormones induced a strong, concentration-dependent stimulation of integration (with maximum values observed with DHEA at 3 × 10−5M, testosterone at 10−8M, and 17β-estradiol at 10−11M). For testosterone and 17β-estradiol, this was also reflected by an increase of glycosaminoglycan content. Adhesive strength was increased with IL-1β at 10 pg/ml, but not at 1 pg/ml or 100 pg/ml.

X-ray diffraction (XRD) data analysis evidenced the formation of only the tetragonal rutile-type phase in all samples. Meanwhile, the mean crystallite size shows a progressive reduction with the Ni content, the unit cell volume and residual strain does not show any clear dependence on the Ni content. Room temperature Mossbauer spectra were well modeled by using two doublets which represent the particle core and shell surface regions. Assuming that the isomer shift (IS) of the core region remains constant for all samples, the isomer shift of the shell region shows a linear increase with the Ni content. That increase was assigned to the progressive increase in the s-electronic density produced by either the generation of oxygen vacancies or the formation of Ni complexes at the surface due to the surface segregation of Ni ions as the Ni content is increased. Larger QS values obtained for the doublet of the shell are associated with the stronger distortions in the nearest surrounding of tin atoms produced by the surface segregation of Ni ions."

The following facts were disclosed: (1) The NIPA/SA gels swelled in 4<pH<10, as a result of ionization of acrylic acid (AAc). (2) When pH was varied, 〈I〉E exhibited a maximum around pH 5. This was accounted for by the interplay of the two antagonistic effects on scattered intensity due to ionization of the gel, i.e. (i) an increase in heterogeneities by swelling and (ii) a decrease in heterogeneity due to an increase in osmotic pressure. (3) On the other hand, 〈IF〉T decreased in the pH region between 5.2<pH<10, due to an increase in osmotic modulus by ionization of the network chains.

For this, we have taken 80 cases of senile cataract patients compared with 100 age matched controls. RESULTS: A significant increase in the levels of Serum MDA, whereas significant decrease in the levels of reduced glutathione, Serum GST and Vit-C were observed. CONCLUSION: This suggests that oxidative stress and reduced anti oxidant defense mechanism play an important role in the pathogenesis of Senile cataract which needs further studies."

The origin of protostellar jets as well as their impact on the regulation of angular momentum and the inner disk physics are still crucial open questions in star formation. Aims. We aim to test the different proposed ejection processes in T Tauri stars through high-angular resolution observations of forbidden-line emission from the inner DG Tauri microjet. Methods. We present spectro-imaging observations of the DG Tauri jet obtained with SINFONI/VLT in the lines of [Fe ii]λ1.64 μm, 1.53 μm with 0. 15 angular resolution and R = 3000 spectral resolution. We analyze the morphology and kinematics, derive electronic densities and mass-flux rates and discuss the implications for proposed jet launching models. Results. (1) We observe an onion-like velocity structure in [Fe ii] in the blueshifted jet, similar to that observed in optical lines. Highvelocity (HV) gas at � –200 km s −1 is collimated inside a half-opening angle of 4 ◦ and medium-velocity (MV) gas at � –100 km s −1 in a cone with an half-opening angle 14. (2) Two new axial jet knots are detected in the blue jet, as well as a more distant bubble with corresponding counter-bubble. The periodic knot ejection timescale is revised downward to 2.5 yrs. (3) The redshifted jet is detected only beyond 0. 7 from the star, yielding revised constraints on the disk surface density. (4) From comparison to [O i ]d ata we infer iron depletion of a factor 3 at high velocities and a factor 10 at speeds below –100 km s −1 . (5) The mass-fluxes in each of the medium"

Probertite and glauberite are the main rock-forming minerals in the lacustrine Doganlar succession of the Emet basin. The present paper seeks to characterize and interpret the facies and depositional settings of this mineral association. Probertite is made up largely of microfibers arranged in microbundles, and displays a variety of lithofacies. Many lithofacies show deformation and flowage structures which can be assigned to multistage growth of probertite under synsedimentary conditions. Glauberite displays laminated lithofacies formed by fine-grained clear crystals, and thin- to thick-bedded lithofacies composed of coarser crystals and variable proportions of siliciclastic matrix. Depositional pairs of probertite and glauberite occur at millimeter (laminites), centimeter (alternations), and meter (cycles) scales. Probertite and glauberite are primary products grown subaqueously in a relatively shallow saline lake—either on the bottom (probertite and glauberite) or as cumulate crystals (glauberite)—and interstitially below and close to the bottom. The laminites are made up of microcycles composed of several types of laminae. The microcycles are interpreted as predominantly pluriannual precipitates. In the proposed lake model, the brine body is not deep, as indicated by frequent episodes of subaerial exposure recorded in the succession. This study provides new insight into the genesis of glauberite and probertite, the interpretation of nodular lithofacies, the type of “microfiber evaporites,” the evaporite units made up of sulfate–borate alternations, and the petrographic description of glauberite laminites and their paleoenvironmental interpretation."

Stringent infection control regimens need to be followed to prevent spread. One such measure is the disposal of unused, MRSA-contaminated single-use items, which is quite expensive. An alternative, less costly measure is to store these items temporarily, re-using them once the organism is non-viable. To establish survival times of MRSA on sterile goods packaging, paper and foil samples were contaminated with MRSA (approximately 10 8 –10 9 cfu/sample). The number of pathogens recoverable from the samples was measured at defined times. MRSA was demonstrated to survive on sterile goods packaging for more than 38 weeks. No MRSA was recoverable after 50 weeks. Temporary storage of MRSA-contaminated single-use items for such a long period of time is not an appropriate or reliable means of decontamination, but many be considered for items that would be costly to replace."

Neurons in the mediorostral zone of the parietal ganglia, i.e., neurons LPa2, LPa3, RPa2, and RPa3, send processes via most of the visceral nerves, the pedal nerves, and the cutaneous nerves of the pedal ganglia [1, 3]. Command neurons trigger contraction of the pneumostoma and a series of somatic muscles. In addition, these cells send synaptic potentials to the heart and the walls of the pulmonary cavity [2, 4]. We have observed that activation of command neurons in the parietal ganglia leads to the appearance of postsynaptic potentials (PSP) in many visceral muscles and in the walls of some internal organs. These data were obtained using a new modification of the semi-intact preparation in which virtually all neuroeffector connections are preserved [5]. Command neuron activity was recorded by standard microelectrode techniques. Postsynaptic potentials were recorded using macroelectrodes consisting of glass pipettes with tip diameters of 100‐250 μm. Macroelectrodes were attached to flexible polyethylene tubing and filled with physiological saline. Large muscles were studied by inserting the electrode into the muscle, while thin-walled organs were studied by recording potentials from the surface. Activation of command neurons LPa2 and RPa2, as well as RPa3, induced postsynaptic potentials in the heart, pericardium, the wall of the pulmonary cavity, the columellar muscle, the muscles of the mantle ridge and body wall, the walls of the kidney, the antenna tip retractors, and the cerebral artery. In all cases, postsynaptic potentials showed marked facilitation during rhythmic neuron discharges. The first postsynaptic potential following a prolonged period of rest was sometimes below the noise level. In these cases, the coefficient of facilitation was taken as the ratio to the second postsynaptic potential. The coefficient of facilitation during prolonged series of neuron discharges could reach values of the order of 20 or more (Fig. 1. A). Series of postsynaptic potentials in command neurons were accompanied by long-lasting potentiating effects, which then decreased with a time constant of 3‐4 min. Facilitation and potentiation of postsynaptic potentials occurred differently in different neurons. This is evidence for the absence of any common terminal switching. The latent periods of postsynaptic potentials varied slightly from preparation to preparation and depend on the recording site. The latent periods of postsynaptic potentials at different points can be compared from the results presented from one animal (Fig. 2). In this experiment, postsynaptic potentials were sequentially recorded from eight different points in conditions of stimulation of LPa2 and RPa2, as well as RPa3. After action potentials in neuron RPa3, the shortest-latency postsynaptic potentials arose in the spurs of the columellar muscle and the wall of the cerebral artery (about 110 msec), while the longest delays were recorded in the mantle (160 msec; Fig. 2, B). Comparison of postsynaptic potentials from different neurons but at the same point showed that postsynaptic potentials from neuron RPa2 appeared in the mantle muscles 25‐30 msec earlier than those from RPa3 (Fig. 2, C). Analysis of the latent periods of postsynaptic potentials at different points showed that in general, changes in potentials from one recording point to another corresponded to the probable changes in the length of the pathways for the neuronal action potentials. Over the range recorded, delays corresponded quite closely to data obtained by Wilgenburg and Milligan [4], who measured the latent periods between action potentials in cell B (terminology used at that time;"

By utilizing the fractional calculus theory and computer simulations, it is found that hyperchaos exists in the new fractional-order four-dimensional system with order less than 4. The lowest order to have hyperchaos in this system is 2.88. The results are validated by the existence of two positive Lyapunov exponents. Using the pole placement technique, a nonlinear state observer is designed to synchronize a class of nonlinear fractional-order systems. The observer method is used to synchronize two identical fractional-order hyperchaotic systems. In addition, the active control technique is applied to synchronize the new fractional-order hyperchaotic system and the fractional-order Chen hyperchaotic system. The two schemes, based on the stability theory of the fractional-order system, are rather simple, theoretically rigorous and convenient to realize synchronization.

To obtain versatile transgene system with combined benefits of a chemical inducer and light inducer, we created various chimeric promoters through the assembly of different copies of the tet operator and Gal4 operator module, which simultaneously responded to a tetracycline-responsive transcription factor and a light-switchable transactivator. The activities of these chimeric promoters can be regulated by tetracycline and blue light synergistically or antagonistically. Further studies of the antagonistic genetic circuit exhibited high spatiotemporal resolution and extremely low leaky expression, which therefore could be used to spatially and stringently control the expression of highly toxic protein Diphtheria toxin A for light regulated gene therapy. When transferring plasmids engineered for the gene switch-driven expression of a firefly luciferase (Fluc) into mice, the Fluc expression levels of the treated animals directly correlated with the tetracycline and light input program. We suggest that dual-input genetic circuits using TET and light that serve as triggers to achieve expression profiles may enable the design of robust therapeutic gene circuits for gene- and cell-based therapies."

Best evidence suggests that position-vestibular-pause (PVP) and eye-head velocity (EHV) neurons in the vestibular nuclei are the primary mediators of vestibulo-ocular reflexes for rotational head movements, yet the linearity of these neurons has not been extensively tested. The current study was undertaken to understand how varying magnitudes of yaw rotation are coded in these neurons. Sixty-six PVP and 41 EHV neurons in the rostral vestibular nuclei of 7 awake rhesus macaques were recorded over a range of frequencies (0.1 to 2 Hz) and peak velocities (7.5 to 210°/s at 0.5 Hz). The sensitivity (gain) of the neurons decreased with increasing peak velocity of rotation for all PVP neurons and EHV neurons sensitive to ipsilateral rotation (type I). The sensitivity of contralateral rotation-sensitive (type II) EHV neurons did not significantly decrease with increasing peak velocity. These data show that, like non-eye-movement-related vestibular nuclear neurons that are believed to mediate nonlinear vestibular functions, PVP neurons involved in the linear vestibulo-ocular reflex also behave in a nonlinear fashion. Similar to other sensory nuclei, the magnitude of the vestibular stimulus is not linearly coded by the responses of vestibular neurons; rather, amplitude compression extends the dynamic range of PVP and type I EHV vestibular neurons."

Lesions of the BLA or infusions of a β-adrenoceptor antagonist into the BLA block glucocorticoid effects on both memory consolidation and retrieval when administered either systemically or directly into the hippocampus. The present experiments examined BLA and β-adrenoceptor involvement in regulating glucocorticoid effects on spatial working memory, a task that depends on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). Male Sprague Dawley rats with bilateral sham- or NMDA-induced lesions of the BLA received either corticosterone (1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.) systemically or the specific glucocorticoid receptor agonist 11β,17β-dihydroxy-6,21-dimethyl-17α-pregna-4,6-trien-20yn-3-one (RU 28362; 3.0 or 10.0 ng in 0.5 μl) into the mPFC shortly before testing on a delayed alternation task in a T-maze. Both glucocorticoid treatments induced comparable impairments in working memory performance in sham-lesioned controls. Although lesions of the BLA alone did not affect working memory, BLA lesions blocked the impairment induced by either corticosterone or RU 28362. Likewise, systemic injections of the centrally acting β-adrenoceptor antagonist propranolol (2.0 mg/kg, i.p.) given before testing prevented corticosterone-induced working memory impairment. These findings indicate that BLA activity is essential for enabling glucocorticoid effects in the mPFC on working memory and suggest that stress hormone-induced modulation of working memory involves noradrenergic activation."

Findings suggest that the DLOQ is applicable to the context of China as well, and those demographic variables, such as age and educational level, together with the types of ownership of Chinese companies, such as state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and privately-owned enterprises (POEs), suggest differences in the culture of learning organizations. Results also indicate that the learning organization culture of a firm has strongly positive impact on employees’ job satisfaction and perceived organizational performance. Two implications should be noted. First, as employees in middle age and with college education show the strongest sense of improving the learning culture, it can be inferred that demographic characters and groups may influence the organization’s learning culture differently. Second, as POEs have a better learning atmosphere than SOEs, it can be inferred that POEs have a stronger competitiveness than SOEs in terms of learning ability and organizational performance. To indigenize the Western construct and instrument of learning organizations, the present study, as an exploratory research, gives substantial knowledge on the subject and seeks to fill the gap in the literature, despite the limitations of cultural nuances and a narrowly-concentrated sample."

Unfortunately, this has a tendency to result in device failure due to delamination. For example, with benders the typical lifetime is 105 to 106 cycles, limiting its use in practical applications. This poses an interesting design tradeoff: the stroke is increased due to sharper gradients between material layers; however, the higher gradients lead to high stress concentrations at those interfaces. One approach to reducing these stresses is to grade the material properties through a monolithic piece of piezoceramic so that no interfaces or bonding elements exist, but this comes at the cost of stroke. This paper explores the design tradeoff inherent to monolithic functionally graded piezoelectrics. An analytical free-displacement model for a monolithic piezoceramic beam with a generic gradient is derived. Key to this is the inclusion of the complex electric field distribution which rises from the non-homogeneous material properties. This model is used along with finite element models to examine the effect of continuous linear and stepwise material gradients on the displacement performance as well as the stress levels. The study shows that using monolithic functionally graded piezocermics can significantly reduce the stresses with only a minor impact on the device stroke.© 2003 ASME"

Then, a comparative experimental study concerning the ageing of PFAE, FR3 and mineral oil (Shell Diala B) was conducted. Several important properties such as breakdown voltage; dielectric dissipation factor (tan δ) and capacitance of PFAE and FR3 oils were measured. Variations of ageing time have been applied during experimental process. The results revealed that both oils show higher breakdown voltage compare to mineral oil (Shell Diala B). In addition, both of the oils have lower value of dielectric dissipation factor (Tan Delta) and higher value of capacitance. Thus, make both oils as good insulating materials."

(Bp) is widely distributed in China and has been widely used as a traditional Chinese medicine. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of the extract of Bp on androgen deficiency dry eye and determine its possible mechanisms. Methods: Twenty-four rats were randomly divided into four groups: Group Con (control), Group Sal (physiological saline), Group Fin (oral finasteride), and Group Bp (oral finasteride and Bp). The dry eye model was established in group Fin and group Bp. Aqueous tear quantity was measured with phenol red-impregnated cotton threads with anesthesia. Tear film breakup time (BUT) and corneal epithelial damage were evaluated by fluorescein staining. Animals were sacrificed at 28 days, and ocular tissues (lacrimal gland and cornea) were evaluated with light microscopy; gene microarray analysis for inflammatory cytokines and Western blot were also performed. Results: Finasteride administration effectively induced dry eye in rats by 14 days after administration. Group Fin rats had significantly higher fluorescein staining scores and lower aqueous tear quantity and BUT than the group Con rats, and notable inflammatory cell infiltrates were observed in the lacrimal gland of group Fin rats. The fluorescein staining score, aqueous tear quantity and BUT significantly improved with Bp treatment in the group Bp rats, and the structures of the lacrimal gland were well maintained without significant lymphocyte infiltration. Cytokine antibody array data identified the cytokines B7-2/Cd86, IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, MMP-8, FasL, TNF-α and TIMP-1 as candidates for validation by Western blot. Expression levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, in group Fin were upregulated compared with group Con. Levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-4 and IL-10, in group Fin were also upregulated compared with those in group Con. Compared with group Fin, IL-1β, FasL, and TNF-α were significantly decreased in group Bp. Conclusion: The extract of Bp appears to be effective for the treatment of androgen deficiency dry eye in rats by improving aqueous tear quantity, maintaining tear film stability, and inhibiting the inflammation of the lacrimal gland."

It took two years for members of the clergy to recognise that by its prolonged silence the Church had in fact jettisoned its traditional views on ‘justice and charity’ for all men.

Virulent strains harboring the cag pathogenicity island (cag PAI) which encode a Type IV Secretion System (T4SS) can induce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 and deliver their major effector proteins CagA into the gastric cells. While a subset of cag PAI genes have been identified to be the homologues of T4SS genes from Agrobacterium tumefaciens, a majority have unknown functions. We have identified one of such proteins, Cag1, which was predicted to be a non-classically secreted and virulent protein. Our results showed that Cag1 is a membrane-associated protein essential for the induction of multiple cytokine secretions, and cag1-deficient mutant has partial influence on CagA translocation; while the protein itself was not injected into host cells. Our data indicated that Cag1 is located in the bacterial membrane and is associated with the function of T4SS."

This study evaluates whether orientation to time, place, and self (Ox3) serves as sufficient indicator of general cognitive status to support such decisions. Design: Participants with and without TBI were administered the PTBI in one to three individual testing sessions. Performance on Ox3 items were compared between groups, as well as performance on subtests representing broader cognitive and linguistic skills. Setting: Pediatric brain injury in patient acute and rehab units. Participants: Twenty-eight children with TBI (18 male, 10 female) between the ages of 6 and 16 years of age served as participants. Of these, 12 were initially classified as severe, 6 moderate, and 10 mild on the Glasgow Coma Scale. Interventions: NA Main Outcome Measures: The Pediatric Test of Brain Injury (PTBI) is a criterion-referenced, standardized test designed to measure neurocognitive, language and literacy abilities in children recovering from brain injury. The entire test, including its Orientation subtest, was administered to participants during the acute phase of recovery (within 3 months of injury). Results: Despite no differences between the TBI and control group on the Orientation subtests, deficits occurred in other cognitive-linguistic domains that are relevant to functioning outside medical and rehabilitation environments. Furthermore, even neurologically-normal children sometimes failed some Ox3 items. Conclusion: The findings on Orientation items from the PTBI indicates that caution is warranted in applying the “Ox3” standard for evaluating cognitive status to a pediatric TBI population."

With the effect of this slogan, people tends to analogize more and more new expressions, for example: sheng-henda (省很大) “save-very-big”, shui-henda (睡很大) “sleep-very-big”, and etc. Until 2013, the quantity of the coined expressions is still increasing. In the previous studies of Shen (2009), Xiao (2009), Liu (2010) and Liu (2012) on the structure of X-henda (X-很大), the structure is highly productive, involves an extreme or exaggerative meaning, is featured of rising tone, stress, and lengthening, and is initiated with a verb or an adjective. This present study argues henda in X-henda is a bound form (or a particle (助詞); Chao, 1979), similar to qilai (起來) in X-qilai or bude (不得) in X-bude, especially without objects or objects-preceding. With Distributed Morphology, a derivational analysis of the X-henda structure indicates that the function of henda intensifies the effect of sha to the extreme degree with rising tone, stress and lengthening to perform exaggeration on the object (in a sentence). The results may further contribute to grammaticalization analyses, verb-complement structure analyses and Chinese language teaching."

MS were tested by sit-and-reach flexibility, vertical jump, hand grip strenght and back and leg strength tests. After the data were entered into the SPSS 16,0 program, paired t-test was done in order to determine the difference between genders. Also, the interaction among PAL, academic success, academic competency and MS of male and female students were analysed through Pearson correlation analysis. As a result, it was found out that parameters related to the PAL and strength of male students are higher than those of female ones while female students’ academic success levels are better than those of male students. In addition, while no significant relation between academic success and PAL was found, a positive relation was determined the academic success and perceived academic competency of both genders."

Its exact morphology in the human is still insufficiently known. The histology in serial sections of upper and lower lid margins in whole-mount specimens from 10 human body donors was compared to in vivo confocal microscopy of eight eyes with a Heidelberg retina-tomograph (HRT II) and attached Rostock cornea module. Behind the posterior margin of the Meibomian orifices, the cornified epidermis stopped abruptly and was replaced by a continuous layer of para-keratinized (pk) cells followed by discontinuous pk cells. The pk cells covered the muco-cutaneous junction (MCJ), the surface of which corresponded to the line of Marx (0.2‐0.3 mm wide). Then a stratified epithelium with a conjunctival structure of cuboidal cells, some pk cells, and goblet cells formed an epithelial elevation of typically about 100 lm initial thickness (lid wiper). This continued for 0.3‐1.5 mm and formed a slope. The MCJ and lid wiper extended all along the lid margin from nasal to temporal positions in the upper and lower lids. Details of the epithelium and connective tissue were also detectable using the Rostock cornea module. The human inner lid border has distinct zones. Due to its location and morphology, the epithelial lip of the lid wiper appears a suitable structure to spread the tear film and is distinct from the MCJ ⁄line of Marx. Better knowledge of the lid margin appears important for understanding dry eye disease and its morphology can be analysed clinically by in vivo confocal microscopy."

One hundred fifty questionnaires were distributed and a total of 140 usable data were coded for further statistical analysis that includes descriptive statistics (frequency and test) through SPSSWIN 17.0. The results show that a majority of the domestic scuba diving suit companies were either small, manufactured products under original equipment manufacturer (OEM) brands, or were involved in the import business. Many of these companies have developed a local sizing system derived from a company database of customer sizing. As a result, different companies have different sizes that lead to confusion and complication among consumers in selecting the correct size for scuba diving suits. The results indicate that most high-priced diving suits are made of imported fabrics because they had superior quality, fitness, and thickness compared to domestic brands. The degree of consumer satisfaction with scuba diving suits was found to be low in comfort, stuffiness, and activity. Respondents indicated that they felt a little tightness in circumstances such as bust, wrist, and thigh in measurements of circumstances. On the other hand, the respondents showed a high degree of satisfaction with body fitness in scuba diving suits. Further research will clarify a standardized sizing system and develop patterns suitable for Korean men's scuba diving suit body sizes."

While previous work has been undertaken on the first two cervical vertebrae, there is a dearth of studies on the subaxial cervical spine in hominines. In this paper, we provide detailed morphological information on two important aspects of the subaxial cervical vertebrae (C3 – C7): mid-sagittal morphology and superior facet orientation. We studied large samples of African apes including modern humans and the most complete fossil hominin subaxial cervical vertebrae using both traditional and geometric morphometrics. There are significant differences between extant hominoids related to the relative length and orientation of the spinous process as well as to the orientation of the articular facets, which are related to size, locomotion, and neck posture. In fact, fossil hominins do not completely conform to any of the extant groups. Our assessment of mid-sagittal morphology and superior articular facet orientation shows that australopiths have more  Homo -like upper subaxial cervical vertebrae coupled with more “primitive” lower cervical vertebrae. Based on these results, we hypothesize that those changes, maybe related to postural changes derived from bipedalism, did not affect the entire subaxial cervical spine at once. From a methodological point of view, the combination of traditional and geometric morphometric data provides a more integrative perspective of morphological change and evolution, which is certainly useful in human evolutionary studies."

Film was an important component of building English–Afrikaner national identity and unity. Black people in general and Africans in particular stood outside this nation-building project, on and off screen. In fact, cinema for Africans positioned them in such a way that their exclusion from any putative South African ‘nation’ seemed a ‘reasonable’ decision.

The results show that ecological sustainable development of Chengdu is in the state of ecological deficit, which is 1.43 million hm2 in 2013, and different rate1 and rate2 will lead to different changes in the ecological deficit. When rate1 = rate2 = 0.1, the degree of ecological deficit in Chengdu is reduced from 1.43 million hm2 to 1.24 million hm2 in 2013–2018, and after 2018, it begins to increase, which will reach 1.32 million hm2 in 2021.

This paper presents the transfer mechanisms of metallic aggregates from substrate to substrate though contact with tools used during wafer processing. In addition we propose models which agree with the experimental observations. The influence of several parameters on the transfer coefficients has been investigated, including the type of contamination (deposited films, particles...), the size or shape of the particle, the composition of the particle (metallic or dielectric), the substrate and the roughness and flatness of the plates used to hold the wafers during processing as well as the substrate surface composition (bare Si, oxidized...). The transfer of metals via the contact between solid objects only occurs from particular mechanisms. Not considering electrical forces, the first order parameter on the transfer is the particle size. Global transfer by contact occurs mainly in the 0.5-5@mm range and can be as high as 10%. For the second order, the parameters mentioned previously can affect the transfer of the particles, for example, an increase of the particle roughness induces an increase of the separation distance between particle and substrate which consequently decreases the Van der Waals interactions."

Analogy can be illuminating, but it also can obscure or mislead. This article contends that there are three quintessential similarities between the two polities. Both are permeated perennially by agency problems. Each is a self-claimed “virtuocracy.” And both hold aloft distributive justice, a mission that, if overlooked, would undermine the polities’ raisons d’etre. This essay also contends that the two polities differ in three fundamental aspects. Seemingly functioning beyond a legal framework, the clerics and others who broadly implement the policies of the Catholic Church actually are as subject to the law as anybody in a liberal democracy, unlike the leaders of the party-state in China. Second, the party-state in China is more obsessed with blame avoidance than claiming credit, while the reverse is true for the Holy See. Finally, and paradoxically, the party-state in China is far less ideologically constrained than the Vatican. These comparisons and contrasts between the two polities help to shed light on the intrinsic nature of each regime."

In the 2 years since this discovery was first described there has been a large amount of research investigating the detailed mechanisms, prognostic significance and diagnostic utility of these chromosomal aberrations. Taking the numbers from the 10 large published series in aggregate, TMPRSS2 fusions occur in 49% of localised prostate cancers. TMPRSS2 fusion-positive prostate cancers have a significantly worse prognosis than TMPRSS2 fusion-negative prostate cancers and certain subtypes of TMPRSS2 fusions (e.g. ‘2+Edel') have a significantly worse prognosis within TMPRSS2 fusion-positive cancers. There are five morphological features associated with TMPRSS2 fusion-positive cancers (blue-tinged mucin, cribriform growth pattern, macronucleoli, intraductal tumour spread, signet-ring cell features) and if three or more of these are present there is a strong (93%) positive predictive value of the genetic abnormality. TMPRSS2 fusions are easily detected by a break-apart fluorescence  in situ  hybridisation assay so if the adverse prognostic significance of these fusions becomes a clinically useful datum then histopathology departments will be involved in this testing in collaboration with cytogenetics services."

Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activates signaling pathways leading to the expression of proinflammatory cytokines implicated the etiology of DCM. We sought to determine whether EV replication activates TLR4-dependent immune response in myocardium obtained from patients with DCM. Endomyocardial biopsy tissues were obtained from 56 patients with DCM and 10 controls. Levels of plus- and minus-strand EV RNA and TLR4 mRNA were measured by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical analysis was performed to identify the cellular source of EV capsid protein VP1 and TLR4. Both plus- and minus-strand EV RNA were detected in 19 DCM patients (34%). Neither strand of EV RNA was detected in controls. TLR4 mRNA levels were higher in DCM patients than in controls (P<0.001). A positive correlation was found between TLR4 levels and each strand type of EV RNA in EV RNA-positive patients (plus-strand vs TLR4: r=0.69, P<0.001; minus-strand vs TLR4: r=0.65, P= 0.002). VP1/TLR4 double staining showed extensive colocalization of VP1 and TLR4 proteins in cytoplasm of cardiac myocytes in myocardium obtained from DCM patients. EV RNA-positive patients showed lower systolic function and larger ventricular volume compared with EV RNA-negative patients left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF): P= 0.002; left ventricular end-systolic diameter (LVESD): P= 0.004). The DCM subgroup with high TLR4 levels showed lower LVEF and larger LVESD than the subgroup with TLR4 levels (both P<0.001). This study suggests that myocardial expression of TLR4 associates with EV replication in human DCM. EV RNA and TLR4 mRNA levels may correlate with LV dysfunction in DCM. The expression of TLR4 against EV replication may be involved in the pathogenesis of DCM."

In this study, the whole waxy wheat was milled into five fractions using the gradual milling method and the phenolic contents and antioxidant capacity of these flours were investigated. The total phenolic and flavonoid contents of free and bound phenolic extracts gradually increased in the order from the inner to the outer fractions. The flours milled from the outer parts of grain contained significantly higher amount of phenolics and exhibited significantly higher antioxidant capacity than did the whole grain. Likewise, the inner flour fractions milled from mostly endosperm part had significantly higher amount of phenolics and exhibited significantly higher antioxidant capacity than did the white flour, which was milled by a conventional milling method. Thus, the graded flours from whole waxy wheat should be encouraged to be used for processing whole-grain foods to improve both qualities of end-use products and health benefits."

The phase purity and crystal quality of CZTS films were investigated as a function of Zn/Sn ratio. Phase purity and photoelectrochemical response are both enhanced with increasing Zn/Sn ratio after sulfurization at 500 °C or 550 °C. The highest photoelectrochemical response at a liquid junction is 0.99 mA/cm 2  for CZTS layer with Zn/Sn = 0.98 after sulfurization at 550 °C.

The transfer limits were obtained evaluating the results of transient stability simulations of single contingencies under different operating conditions, accordingly to the current security criteria. The dependency of the maximum flow through a link on the flows of other links is taken into account, thus obtaining a secure operation region rather than a single value in each case."

It requires general anaesthesia and full operative facilities. Due to the risk of complications, laparoscopy is frequently postponed to the final stage of infertility evaluation or even after treatment trials have failed. Transvaginal hydrolaparoscopy (THL) is based on vaginal access using a needle puncture technique and saline for distention. THL can be performed on an outpatient basis under local anaesthesia. However, little data exist concerning the accuracy of THL in comparison with laparoscopy. We conducted a prospective comparative blind trial to assess the feasibility and accuracy of THL compared with diagnostic laparoscopy in infertile women. Sixty women were assigned to undergo THL immediately prior to laparoscopy. Different operators evaluated the findings of the two procedures. In order to evaluate the accuracy of THL, findings in terms of tubal pathology, endometriosis and adhesions were analysed. The success rate of accessing the pouch of Douglas was 90.2%. Complication rate was 1.6%. THL diagnosis was correlated with that of laparoscopy in 92.3% of cases. In cases of abnormal findings by THL, there were no normal laparoscopies. Our pilot study suggests that THL is a safe and reproducible method. Retroverted uterus should be considered as a relative contraindication to THL. When a complete evaluation by THL is available, it is a highly accurate technique in comparison with the laparoscopy."

The potential advantages include rigid fixation with early mobilization and more comfort in the post-operative period. However, complications like wound infections can jeopardize the final outcome of these procedures. These infections range from small areas of dehiscence to large wounds with hardware exposure. The conventional approach of serial wound debridement and antibiotic administration can last for a very long period and is only successful in cases of mild infections. Paraspinous muscle flaps have been reported to be a simple and very effective method of treating difficult wounds.1–3 However, in the more severe cases of infection with exposed hardware, the extensive skin and muscle reactive fibrosis adjacent to the wound makes the paraspinous muscle flaps difficult, if not impossible to dissect. Moreover, even if they could be dissected, they would not have sufficient volume to fill these wide and deep wounds. In this situation, the pedicled latissimus dorsi and trapezius muscle flaps have proven to be the most reliable methods of treatment.4–6 We present our experience in the management of these more complex wounds with hardware exposure in two patients, where we used combined pedicled flaps."

A new flexible bipolar ablation device (Cryotherm probe [CTP]) was developed combining radiofrequency and cryotechnology.  Objective  To evaluate the efficacy of the CTP in destroying neoplastic tissue of explanted pancreatic tumors of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma.  Design  Ex vivo clinical study.  Setting  Inpatient hospital setting.  Patients  This study involved 16 explanted pancreatic tumors from 16 patients.  Interventions  CTP application was performed on explanted pancreatic tumors. Anatomic specimens were divided into 4 groups; each group received a predefined application time of 120 to 600 seconds.  Main Outcome Measurements  The coagulation diameter (short axis) perpendicular to the device's longitudinal axis was used as the primary outcome measure.  Results  All pancreatic specimens showed histological signs of coagulative necrosis. There was a positive correlation between the short axis of the obtained necrosis and duration of application ( r  = 0.74).  Limitations  This study was an ex vivo study with all limitations typical of this kind of study.  Conclusions  The CTP is effective in destroying neoplastic pancreatic tissue, creating an ablation zone, the extent of which is related to the duration of application."

The objective of this study was to design and evaluate an animated computer agent to explain research consent forms to potential research participants.  Methods  Subjects were invited to participate in a simulated consent process for a study involving a genetic repository. Explanation of the research consent form by the computer agent was compared to explanation by a human and a self-study condition in a randomized trial. Responses were compared according to level of health literacy.  Results  Participants were most satisfied with the consent process and most likely to sign the consent form when it was explained by the computer agent, regardless of health literacy level. Participants with adequate health literacy demonstrated the highest level of comprehension with the computer agent-based explanation compared to the other two conditions. However, participants with limited health literacy showed poor comprehension levels in all three conditions. Participants with limited health literacy reported several reasons, such as lack of time constraints, ability to re-ask questions, and lack of bias, for preferring the computer agent-based explanation over a human-based one.  Conclusion  Animated computer agents can perform as well as or better than humans in the administration of informed consent.  Practice implications  Animated computer agents represent a viable method for explaining health documents to patients."

The interpretations and uses of high-stakes test scores rely on a number of policy assumptions about what should be taught in schools, and more specifically, about the content standards and performance standards that should be applied to students and schools. For example, a high-school graduation test can be developed as a measure of readiness for the world of work, for college, or for citizenship and the activities of daily life. The assumptions built into the assessment need to be subjected to scrutiny and criticism if a strong case is to be made for the validity of the proposed interpretation and use."

Deux conceptions sont ici confrontees : la « logique de l’idealite » de Husserl et la « logique de la validite » de Rickert. Contrairement a l’emploi equivoque des termes « validite » et « idealite » chez Heidegger, je montre d’abord que ces deux conceptions, bien que tres proches, ne sont pas parfaitement superposables, car Rickert partage l’antipsychologisme de Husserl mais rejette sa theorie des significations. Il apparait ensuite que cette divergence – particulierement visible dans la recension inedite, par Rickert, du livre tres controverse de Palagyi – touche en realite un « point faible » des Recherches logiques de Husserl : la confusion (reconnue plus tard par Husserl lui-meme) entre les objets logiques et les idealites mathematiques. L’alternative « axiologique » proposee par Rickert evite d’emblee cette confusion en soutenant que le sens logique des propositions, fonde sur de pures « valeurs theoriques », est irreductible a un objet ideal."

From the smoothly varying part of the spectrum, it is possible separately to determine the density and composition as the energy is scanned through the K edges of the constituent elements. From the fit to model layer structures, we determine that there exists a strained layer of permalloy at the permalloy/copper interface that relaxes towards the unstrained density of permalloy on annealing. No such layer exists at the copper/permalloy interface. Cobalt doping results in the formation of a layer of mixed CoNiFe composition, rather than a single Co layer. Oscillations in the spectra above the absorption edges are analyzed in a similar manner to that for diffraction anomalous fine structure and enable the short range order within the layers to be determined.

Data from the BT and BFKV residue-residue interactions verify finding with the MJ interaction, i.e., the radius of gyration (Rg) of H2AX depends non-monotonically on temperature. The increase in Rg is followed by a decay on raising the temperature with a maximum at a characteristic value, Tc, which depends on the knowledge-based contact matrix, TcBFKV ≤ TcMJ ≤ TcBT. The range (ΔT) of non-monotonic thermal response and its decay pattern with the temperature are sensitive to interaction. A rather narrow temperature range of ΔTMJ ≈ 0.015–0.022 with the MJ interaction expands and shifts up to ΔTBT ≈ 0.018–0.30 at higher temperatures with the BT interaction and shifts down with the BFKV interaction to ΔTBFKV ≈ 0.011–0.018. The scaling of the structure factor with the wave vector reveals that the structure of the protein undergoes a transformation from a random coil at high temperature to a globular conformation at low temperatures."

Hamodynamische Parameter und endokrine Reaktionen verlaufen wahrend der Narkose allerdings nicht immer parallel. Da jetzt mit Remifentanil ein neuer hoch potenter μ-Agonist zur Verfugung steht, haben wir ihn hinsichtlich seines Einflusses auf endokrine Stressreaktionen und Hamodynamik mit dem sonst von uns fur Netzhauteingriffe in TIVA benutzten Sufentanil verglichen. Methoden: Nach positivem Votum der Ethikkommission und schriftlichem Einverstandnis wurde eine opioidgestutzte TIVA mit Propofol (4 mg/kg/h) und Remifentanil (R-Gruppe) 0,25 μg/kg/min oder Sufentanil (S-Gruppe) 1 μg/kg fraktioniert vor Operationsbeginn mit Dosisanpassungen nach Hamodynamik durchgefuhrt. 22 konsekutive Patienten (ASA I - III), die sich einer Netzhautoperation unterzogen, wurden randomisiert auf zwei Gruppen von je 11 Patienten verteilt. Prolaktin, STH, Kortisol, Adrenalin und Noradrenalin wurden 60 min vor Einleitung der Narkose, 30 min nach Operationsbeginn und 30 min nach Anasthesieende bestimmt. Ergebnisse: Signifikanz-Niveau: P < 0,05. Nur Prolaktin zeigte in beiden Gruppen intraoperativ einen signifikanten Anstieg. Die S-Gruppe zeigte einen deutlicheren Anstieg als die R-Gruppe. Die Kortisol- und Noradrenalinkonzentrationen sanken wahrend der Operation in beiden Gruppen im Vergleich zu den Ausgangswerten signifikant ab. STH und Adrenalin sanken nur in der S-Gruppe wahrend der Operation ab, wahrend in der R-Gruppe keine signifikante Veranderung im Vergleich zu den Ausgangswerten zu beobachten war. Zwischen den beiden Gruppen zeigten sich keine signifikanten Unterschiede. Der Blutdruck sank wahrend der Operation in beiden Gruppen um ca. 30 % vom Ausgangswert. In der R-Gruppe war die Herzfrequenz mit 58/min in der Tendenz niedriger als in der S-Gruppe mit 64/min (Mittelwerte). Schlussfolgerung: Da in keiner der beiden Gruppen mit Ausnahme des Prolaktins ein Anstieg der Stresshormone zu beobachten war, bieten sowohl Remifentanil als auch Sufentanil eine ausreichende Abschirmung gegen chirurgische Stimuli. Den intraoperativen Anstieg der Prolaktinspiegel interpretieren wir als Ausdruck der Stimulation von μ1-Rezeptoren. Objective: Increases of heart rate and blood pressure during anaesthesia are interpreted as a response to surgical stimulation, although the endocrine response and the cardiovascular reaction can differ markedly. We compared remifentanil and sufentanil as part of a TIVA for retinal surgery with respect to the endocrine stress responses and haemodynamic reactions. Methods: After ethics committee approval and informed consent, 22 patients (ASA I - III) scheduled for retinal surgery were included in this patient-blind, randomized, prospective parallel-group study and allocated to one of the two groups receiving TIVA with propofol (4 mg/kg/h) and remifentanil (R-group) 0,25 μg/kg/min, or sufentanil (S-group) 1 μg/kg before surgery with dosage adjustments according to haemodynamic parameters. Prolactin, growth hormone, cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine were measured 60 min before anaesthesia, 30 min after start of surgery and 30 min after extubation. Results: (Significance level: P < 0,05) Only prolactin increased significantly in both groups during the surgical procedure, the S-group showing a greater increase than the R-group. Cortisol and norepinephrine concentrations decreased during surgery in both groups significantly. Growth hormone and epinephrine concentrations only decreased in the S-group during operation while there was no significant change in the R-group. The blood pressure dropped by about 30 % in both groups intraoperatively while there was a tendency towards lower heart rates in the R-group with 58/min vs. 64/min in the S-group (mean). Conclusion: The increase of prolactin concentrations could be interpreted as a result of the stimulation of μ1-receptors. As all other measured stress hormones did not increase in both groups, remifentanil and sufentanil both provide an effective suppression of noxious stimulation induced endocrine response."

Method and Materials: An analytical expression for the noise in a fan beam CT was derived. To validate it, 100 128 × 128 noiseimages were simulated for several settings: uniform and non‐uniform noise and fan angles of 29°, 8.5°, and 2.5°. For each image, 200 projections were used, and each projection had 128 elements which were filtered by an unweighted ramp filter. A central 90 by 90 array of each noiseimage was extracted. By squaring the magnitude of the 2D FFT of extracted images, 2D NPS images were generated. The 1D radial NPS was calculated by circumferencial averaging and by averaging over the 100 realizations. The non‐stationary behavior was examined by similar processing of local regions. Results: The measured 1D NPS from a entire FOV and from local regions shows good agreement with the analytically derived 1D NPS formula. The analysis shows that whereas the NPS in a parallel beam CT is proportional to frequency, a fan beam NPS has a reduced amplitude, “kink”, at high frequency. It is due to the variable magnification across the FOV and thereby is more pronounced as the fan angle increases. The 2D NPS of a entire FOV with non‐uniform statistics shows the directional dependence and the 2D NPS of local regions shows a shading effect.Conclusion: The NPS provides a useful metric to analyze the image quality. Local measurements can be used when the imagenoise is not stationary. Interesting differences compared to a parallel beam CT are shown, as are instances of non‐stationary noise."

And why do others fear and even despise this animal, whom they see as a danger and a menace, and resent its continued preservation? Bears may act as a token charismatic species in conservation mythology; they may be anthropomorphized into a cuddly roadside attraction evoking childhood nostalgia; or they may play the part of wrathful Nature guarding against human incursion into the wilderness. Tourists in Banff National Park take great pains to see bears, while local hikers and campers expend almost equal energy avoiding an ursine encounter. This paper explores what human reactions to bears reveal about social attitudes toward the natural world, particularly in areas like the Canadian Rockies where human and bear territory overlap."

Regrettably, it turned out that primary repair is not an option for the ruptured ACL due to its incapacity to heal [1]. Reconstruction with different augmentations devices has also only presented disheartening results. This has led orthopaedic surgeons to perform ACL reconstruction instead of repair. Initially ACL reconstruction was performed using arthrotomy with the goal to reproduce the native anatomy of the ACL. As with all modern surgery, minimally invasive surgical techniques were introduced in knee surgery and with it the start of arthroscopically-assisted ACL reconstruction [2]. In the beginning, arthroscopic ACL reconstruction was performed using a two-incision technique in which the femoral bone tunnel was drilled from outside-in. Over time this changed to one-incision technique in which the femoral bone tunnel is drilled inside-out through the tibial tunnel.#R##N##R##N#Recent studies found that this traditional single-bundle reconstruction fails to reproduce native ACL anatomy and does not fully restore the rotational stability of the knee joint and a more anatomic approach to ACL reconstruction was proposed [3]. The double-bundle technique brought the focus of ACL reconstruction back to restoring anatomy. It has shown superior results in terms of rotational stability in both biomechanical [4] and clinical studies [5]. However, it is vital to differentiate between anatomic and double-bundle ACL reconstruction. The latter is merely a step closer to reproduce the native anatomy of the ACL; however, it can still be done non-anatomically. Moreover, anatomic ACL reconstruction can also be performed using a single-bundle technique. Non-anatomic tibial and femoral tunnel placement represents one of the most important causes of ACL graft failure [6]. When the tibial tunnels are placed too anteriorly, it may lead to roof impingement, which is associated with loss of extension and abrasion of the graft [7]. To prevent this, some surgeons move their tibial tunnel more posteriorly. However, this approach creates tunnel mismatch [8]. Often, a tibial tunnel positioned at the PL insertion site is combined with an (high) AM femoral tunnel. It results in tunnel placement outside of the native insertion site, which can result in abnormal knee kinematics [9]. Multiple studies have demonstrated that non-anatomic tunnel placement results in limited range of motion, higher than physiologic graft tension, and ultimately graft failure [10, 11]. Biological healing of the graft-bone interface may also be affected [12].#R##N##R##N#Anatomic ACL reconstruction can be defined as the functional restoration of the ACL to its native dimensions, collagen orientation, and insertion sites [13]. Use of a three-portal technique with a medial viewing portal facilitates a true anatomic ACL reconstruction. Anatomic ACL reconstruction can be performed in both single- and double-bundle reconstruction, and in primary, revision and augmentation surgery [14]. However, when different aspects of the surgery are compared, such as single- versus double-bundle techniques, it is necessary that both procedures are performed in an anatomic fashion. Most of the clinical studies comparing single-bundle to double-bundle reconstruction do not present a fair comparison since often one or both surgical techniques were not performed anatomically [15, 16]. In addition, associated injuries such as cartilage injuries, meniscus tears and osteoarthritic changes should be taken into account when conducting comparative clinical studies.#R##N##R##N#Another future consideration is the further improvement of our outcome measures for ACL reconstruction. For example, in the office setting it is difficult to quantify differences in rotational stability in absolute terms [17]. New tools should be reliable, accurate, precise and valid. Examples of such tools that currently used for research purposes are dynamic stereo radiography, T2 MRI mapping of cartilage and quantification of graft healing on MRI [3, 18, 19]. Furthermore, there is a need of consensus on which outcome measures should be used, to facilitate homogeneous reporting of outcome amongst authors. For example, currently important outcome measures such as range of motion are underreported [20], even though it provides important clues to accuracy of tunnel placement and the presence of impingement. In addition, patient reported outcomes, such as the IKDC Subjective Knee Form, KOOS, Tegner Activity Scale and Marx Activity Scale, should be reported in all studies. The use of more accurate and standardized outcome measures could demonstrate the benefits of anatomic ACL reconstruction with regard to the restoration of normal structure and function of the knee.#R##N##R##N#Anatomic ACL reconstruction intends to replicate normal anatomy, restore normal kinematics and protect long-term knee health. The road to anatomic ACL reconstruction has been long and winding. It is a detailed surgical procedure with a steep learning curve and many pitfalls. In the future, more reliable, accurate, precise and validated outcome measures are needed to evaluate its results."

Aim  To assess the ‘real world' experience and clinical effectiveness of IM in adults with CF.  Method  Prospective, questionnaire-based, study. Patients successfully passing the Bronchitol Initiation Dose Assessment were consecutively recruited. Questionnaires were completed including answers graded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and closed questions, which were repeated after 6–8 weeks.  Results  23 patients were recruited, 16 patients (63% female, n=10) completed the study; patient drop-out was due to stopping IM (n = 1), or loss to follow up (n = 6). The median age (range) was 29 (17–44) years and median FEV1 (IQR) 1.76L (1.29–2.11L), 54% (39–66%) predicted. VAS scores were obtained at baseline and follow-up (scale 1 [low/least effective] to10 [high/most effective]): the median score for sputum clearance overall was 6.6 (range 1–9). There was a significant improvement in ease of clearance with physiotherapy from median 5.78 to 4.13 (p = 0.01) and an improvement in daytime cough from median 5.09 to 3.88 (p = 0.09). There was no change in length of physiotherapy sessions, with a median of 20 (14–30) minutes and there was no haemoptysis reported. 15 patients (94%) reported completing all 10 capsules at each dose and FEV1 did not significantly change in this group.  Conclusion  This small study shows IM was associated with an improvement in ease of sputum clearance in adults with CF. There was no evidence of increased incidence of haemoptysis, cough or length of physiotherapy sessions. Larger studies are needed to evaluate the long term clinical effects."
